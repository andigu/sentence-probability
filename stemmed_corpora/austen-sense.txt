[sens and sensibl by jane austen 1811]

chapter 1


the famili of dashwood had long been settl in sussex
their estat wa larg and their resid wa at norland park
in the centr of their properti where for mani gener
they had live in so respect a manner as to engag
the gener good opinion of their surround acquaint
the late owner of thi estat wa a singl man who live
to a veri advanc age and who for mani year of hi life
had a constant companion and housekeep in hi sister
but her death which happen ten year befor hi own
produc a great alter in hi home; for to suppli
her loss he invit and receiv into hi hous the famili
of hi nephew mr henri dashwood the legal inheritor
of the norland estat and the person to whom he intend
to bequeath it in the societi of hi nephew and niec
and their children the old gentleman day were
comfort spent hi attach to them all increas
the constant attent of mr and mr henri dashwood
to hi wish which proceed not mere from interest
but from good of heart gave him everi degre of solid
comfort which hi age could receive; and the cheer
of the children ad a relish to hi exist

by a former marriag mr henri dashwood had one
son: by hi present ladi three daughter the son
a steadi respect young man wa ampli provid
for by the fortun of hi mother which had been larg
and half of which devolv on him on hi come of age
by hi own marriag likewis which happen soon afterward
he ad to hi wealth to him therefor the success
to the norland estat wa not so realli import as to
hi sisters; for their fortun independ of what might
aris to them from their father inherit that properti
could be but small their mother had noth and their
father onli seven thousand pound in hi own disposal;
for the remain moieti of hi first wife fortun wa
also secur to her child and he had onli a life-interest
in it

the old gentleman died: hi will wa read and
like almost everi other will gave as much disappoint
as pleasur he wa neither so unjust nor so ungrat
as to leav hi estat from hi nephew;--but he left it to him
on such term as destroy half the valu of the bequest
mr dashwood had wish for it more for the sake of hi
wife and daughter than for himself or hi son;--but to
hi son and hi son son a child of four year old
it wa secur in such a way as to leav to himself
no power of provid for those who were most dear
to him and who most need a provis by ani charg
on the estat or by ani sale of it valuabl wood
the whole wa tie up for the benefit of thi child who
in occasion visit with hi father and mother at norland
had so far gain on the affect of hi uncl
by such attract as are by no mean unusu in children
of two or three year old; an imperfect articul
an earnest desir of have hi own way mani cun trick
and a great deal of nois as to outweigh all the valu
of all the attent which for year he had receiv
from hi niec and her daughter he meant not to
be unkind howev and as a mark of hi affect
for the three girl he left them a thousand pound a-piec

mr dashwood disappoint wa at first severe;
but hi temper wa cheer and sanguine; and he might
reason hope to live mani year and by live econom
lay by a consider sum from the produc of an estat
alreadi larg and capabl of almost immedi improv
but the fortun which had been so tardi in come wa hi
onli one twelvemonth he surviv hi uncl no longer;
and ten thousand pound includ the late legaci
wa all that remain for hi widow and daughter

hi son wa sent for as soon as hi danger wa known
and to him mr dashwood recommend with all the strength
and urgenc which ill could command the interest
of hi mother-in-law and sister

mr john dashwood had not the strong feel of the
rest of the family; but he wa affect by a recommend
of such a natur at such a time and he promis to do
everi thing in hi power to make them comfort
hi father wa render easi by such an assur
and mr john dashwood had then leisur to consid how
much there might prudent be in hi power to do for them

he wa not an ill-dispos young man unless to
be rather cold heart and rather selfish is to be
ill-disposed: but he wa in gener well respected;
for he conduct himself with proprieti in the discharg
of hi ordinari duti had he marri a more amiabl woman
he might have been made still more respect than he
was:--h might even have been made amiabl himself; for he
wa veri young when he marri and veri fond of hi wife
but mr john dashwood wa a strong caricatur of himself;--
more narrow-mind and selfish

when he gave hi promis to hi father he medit
within himself to increas the fortun of hi sister
by the present of a thousand pound a-piec he then
realli thought himself equal to it the prospect of four
thousand a-year in addit to hi present incom
besid the remain half of hi own mother fortun
warm hi heart and made him feel capabl of generosity--
ye he would give them three thousand pounds: it would
be liber and handsome! it would be enough to make
them complet easi three thousand pounds! he could
spare so consider a sum with littl inconvenience--
he thought of it all day long and for mani day success
and he did not repent

no sooner wa hi father funer over than mr john
dashwood without send ani notic of her intent to her
mother-in-law arriv with her child and their attend
no one could disput her right to come; the hous wa
her husband from the moment of hi father decease;
but the indelicaci of her conduct wa so much the greater
and to a woman in mr dashwood situat with onli
common feel must have been highli unpleasing;--
but in her mind there wa a sens of honor so keen
a generos so romant that ani offenc of the kind
by whomsoev given or receiv wa to her a sourc
of immov disgust mr john dashwood had never
been a favourit with ani of her husband family;
but she had had no opportun till the present
of shew them with how littl attent to the comfort
of other peopl she could act when occas requir it

so acut did mr dashwood feel thi ungraci
behaviour and so earnestli did she despis her
daughter-in-law for it that on the arriv of the latter
she would have quit the hous for ever had not the
entreati of her eldest girl induc her first to reflect
on the proprieti of go and her own tender love for all
her three children determin her afterward to stay
and for their sake avoid a breach with their brother

elinor thi eldest daughter whose advic wa
so effectu possess a strength of understand
and cool of judgment which qualifi her
though onli nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother
and enabl her frequent to counteract to the advantag
of them all that eager of mind in mr dashwood
which must gener have led to imprud she had
an excel heart;--her disposit wa affection
and her feel were strong; but she knew how to govern
them: it wa a knowledg which her mother had yet to learn;
and which one of her sister had resolv never to be taught

mariann abil were in mani respect
quit equal to elinor she wa sensibl and clever;
but eager in everything: her sorrow her joy could have
no moder she wa gener amiabl interesting: she
wa everyth but prudent the resembl between
her and her mother wa strikingli great

elinor saw with concern the excess of her
sister sensibility; but by mr dashwood it wa valu
and cherish they encourag each other now in the
violenc of their afflict the agoni of grief
which overpow them at first wa voluntarili renew
wa sought for wa creat again and again they gave
themselv up wholli to their sorrow seek increas
of wretched in everi reflect that could afford it
and resolv against ever admit consol
in futur elinor too wa deepli afflicted; but still
she could struggl she could exert herself she could
consult with her brother could receiv her sister-in-law
on her arriv and treat her with proper attention;
and could strive to rous her mother to similar exert
and encourag her to similar forbear

margaret the other sister wa a good-humor
well-dispos girl; but as she had alreadi imbib
a good deal of mariann romanc without have
much of her sens she did not at thirteen bid fair
to equal her sister at a more advanc period of life



chapter 2


mr john dashwood now instal herself mistress
of norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degrad
to the condit of visitor as such howev they were
treat by her with quiet civility; and by her husband
with as much kind as he could feel toward anybodi
beyond himself hi wife and their child he realli
press them with some earnest to consid norland
as their home; and as no plan appear so elig
to mr dashwood as remain there till she could
accommod herself with a hous in the neighbourhood
hi invit wa accept

a continu in a place where everyth remind
her of former delight wa exactli what suit her mind
in season of cheer no temper could be more cheer
than her or possess in a greater degre that sanguin
expect of happi which is happi itself
but in sorrow she must be equal carri away by her fanci
and as far beyond consol as in pleasur she wa
beyond alloy

mr john dashwood did not at all approv of what her
husband intend to do for hi sister to take three
thousand pound from the fortun of their dear littl boy
would be impoverish him to the most dread degre
she beg him to think again on the subject how could
he answer it to himself to rob hi child and hi onli
child too of so larg a sum? and what possibl claim
could the miss dashwood who were relat to him onli by
half blood which she consid as no relationship at all
have on hi generos to so larg an amount it wa veri
well known that no affect wa ever suppos to exist
between the children of ani man by differ marriages;
and whi wa he to ruin himself and their poor littl harri
by give away all hi money to hi half sisters?

it wa my father last request to me repli
her husband that i should assist hi widow and daughter

he did not know what he wa talk of i dare say;
ten to one but he wa light-head at the time
had he been in hi right sens he could not have thought
of such a thing as beg you to give away half your
fortun from your own child

he did not stipul for ani particular sum
my dear fanny; he onli request me in gener term
to assist them and make their situat more comfort
than it wa in hi power to do perhap it would
have been as well if he had left it wholli to myself
he could hardli suppos i should neglect them
but as he requir the promis i could not do less
than give it; at least i thought so at the time
the promis therefor wa given and must be perform
someth must be done for them whenev they leav norland
and settl in a new home

well then let someth be done for them;
but that someth need not be three thousand pound
consid she ad that when the money is onc
part with it never can return your sister will marri
and it will be gone for ever if inde it could
be restor to our poor littl boy--

whi to be sure said her husband veri grave
that would make great differ the time may come when
harri will regret that so larg a sum wa part with
if he should have a numer famili for instanc it would
be a veri conveni addit

to be sure it would

perhap then it would be better for all parti
if the sum were diminish one half--fiv hundr pound
would be a prodigi increas to their fortunes!

oh! beyond anyth great! what brother on earth
would do half so much for hi sister even if realli
hi sisters! and as it is--onli half blood!--but you
have such a gener spirit!

i would not wish to do ani thing mean he repli
one had rather on such occas do too much than
too littl no one at least can think i have not
done enough for them: even themselv they can hardli
expect more

there is no know what they may expect
said the ladi but we are not to think of their
expectations: the question is what you can afford to do

certainly--and i think i may afford to give them five
hundr pound a-piec as it is without ani addit
of mine they will each have about three thousand pound
on their mother death--a veri comfort fortun
for ani young woman

to be sure it is; and inde it strike me that
they can want no addit at all they will have ten
thousand pound divid amongst them if they marri
they will be sure of do well and if they do not
they may all live veri comfort togeth on the interest
of ten thousand pound

that is veri true and therefor i do not know whether
upon the whole it would not be more advis to do
someth for their mother while she live rather than
for them--someth of the annuiti kind i mean--mi sister
would feel the good effect of it as well as herself
a hundr a year would make them all perfectli comfort

hi wife hesit a littl howev in give
her consent to thi plan

to be sure said she it is better than part with
fifteen hundr pound at onc but then if mr dashwood
should live fifteen year we shall be complet taken in

fifteen years! my dear fanny; her life cannot
be worth half that purchas

certainli not; but if you observ peopl alway
live for ever when there is an annuiti to be paid them;
and she is veri stout and healthi and hardli forti
an annuiti is a veri seriou business; it come over
and over everi year and there is no get rid
of it you are not awar of what you are do
i have known a great deal of the troubl of annuities;
for my mother wa clog with the payment of three
to old superannu servant by my father will
and it is amaz how disagre she found it
twice everi year these annuiti were to be paid; and then
there wa the troubl of get it to them; and then one
of them wa said to have die and afterward it turn
out to be no such thing my mother wa quit sick of it
her incom wa not her own she said with such perpetu
claim on it; and it wa the more unkind in my father
becaus otherwis the money would have been entir at
my mother dispos without ani restrict whatev
it ha given me such an abhorr of annuiti that i am
sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for
all the world

it is certainli an unpleas thing repli mr dashwood
to have those kind of yearli drain on one incom
one fortun as your mother justli say is not one own
to be tie down to the regular payment of such a sum
on everi rent day is by no mean desirable: it take away
one independ

undoubtedly; and after all you have no thank for it
they think themselv secur you do no more than what
is expect and it rais no gratitud at all if i were you
whatev i did should be done at my own discret entir
i would not bind myself to allow them ani thing yearli
it may be veri inconveni some year to spare a hundr
or even fifti pound from our own expens

i believ you are right my love; it will be better
that there should by no annuiti in the case; whatev i
may give them occasion will be of far greater assist
than a yearli allow becaus they would onli enlarg
their style of live if they felt sure of a larger incom
and would not be sixpenc the richer for it at the end
of the year it will certainli be much the best way
a present of fifti pound now and then will prevent
their ever be distress for money and will i think
be ampli discharg my promis to my father

to be sure it will inde to say the truth
i am convinc within myself that your father had no idea
of your give them ani money at all the assist
he thought of i dare say wa onli such as might be
reason expect of you; for instanc such as look
out for a comfort small hous for them help them
to move their thing and send them present of fish
and game and so forth whenev they are in season
ill lay my life that he meant noth farther; inde
it would be veri strang and unreason if he did
do but consid my dear mr dashwood how excess
comfort your mother-in-law and her daughter may live
on the interest of seven thousand pound besid the
thousand pound belong to each of the girl which bring
them in fifti pound a year a-piec and of cours
they will pay their mother for their board out of it
altogeth they will have five hundr a-year amongst them
and what on earth can four women want for more than
that?--they will live so cheap! their housekeep will
be noth at all they will have no carriag no hors
and hardli ani servants; they will keep no compani
and can have no expens of ani kind! onli conceiv
how comfort they will be! five hundr a year! i am
sure i cannot imagin how they will spend half of it;
and as to your give them more it is quit absurd to think
of it they will be much more abl to give you someth

upon my word said mr dashwood i believ you
are perfectli right my father certainli could mean
noth more by hi request to me than what you say
i clearli understand it now and i will strictli fulfil
my engag by such act of assist and kind
to them as you have describ when my mother remov
into anoth hous my servic shall be readili given
to accommod her as far as i can some littl present
of furnitur too may be accept then

certainli return mr john dashwood but howev
one thing must be consid when your father and mother
move to norland though the furnitur of stanhil
wa sold all the china plate and linen wa save
and is now left to your mother her hous will therefor
be almost complet fit up as soon as she take it

that is a materi consider undoubtedli
a valuabl legaci indeed! and yet some of the plate would
have been a veri pleasant addit to our own stock here

yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice
as handsom as what belong to thi hous a great
deal too handsom in my opinion for ani place they
can ever afford to live in but howev so it is
your father thought onli of them and i must say this:
that you owe no particular gratitud to him nor attent
to hi wishes; for we veri well know that if he could
he would have left almost everyth in the world to them

thi argument wa irresist it gave to hi
intent whatev of decis wa want before; and he
final resolv that it would be absolut unnecessari
if not highli indecor to do more for the widow
and children of hi father than such kind of neighbourli
act as hi own wife point out



chapter 3


mr dashwood remain at norland sever months;
not from ani disinclin to move when the sight of everi
well known spot ceas to rais the violent emot which it
produc for a while; for when her spirit began to reviv
and her mind becam capabl of some other exert than that
of heighten it afflict by melancholi remembr
she wa impati to be gone and indefatig in her inquiri
for a suitabl dwell in the neighbourhood of norland;
for to remov far from that belov spot wa imposs
but she could hear of no situat that at onc answer
her notion of comfort and eas and suit the prudenc
of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment reject
sever hous as too larg for their incom which her
mother would have approv

mr dashwood had been inform by her husband of the
solemn promis on the part of hi son in their favour
which gave comfort to hi last earthli reflect
she doubt the sincer of thi assur no more than he
had doubt it himself and she thought of it for her daughter
sake with satisfact though as for herself she wa
persuad that a much smaller provis than 7000l would
support her in affluenc for their brother sake too
for the sake of hi own heart she rejoiced; and she
reproach herself for be unjust to hi merit befor
in believ him incap of generos hi attent
behaviour to herself and hi sister convinc her that
their welfar wa dear to him and for a long time
she firmli reli on the liber of hi intent

the contempt which she had veri earli in their acquaint
felt for her daughter-in-law wa veri much increas
by the farther knowledg of her charact which half
a year resid in her famili afforded; and perhap
in spite of everi consider of polit or matern
affect on the side of the former the two ladi might
have found it imposs to have live togeth so long
had not a particular circumst occur to give
still greater elig accord to the opinion
of mr dashwood to her daughter continu at norland

thi circumst wa a grow attach between
her eldest girl and the brother of mr john dashwood
a gentleman-lik and pleas young man who wa introduc
to their acquaint soon after hi sister establish
at norland and who had sinc spent the greatest part
of hi time there

some mother might have encourag the intimaci from
motiv of interest for edward ferrar wa the eldest son
of a man who had die veri rich; and some might have repress
it from motiv of prudenc for except a trifl sum
the whole of hi fortun depend on the will of hi mother
but mr dashwood wa alik uninfluenc by either consider
it wa enough for her that he appear to be amiabl
that he love her daughter and that elinor return
the partial it wa contrari to everi doctrin of
her that differ of fortun should keep ani coupl
asund who were attract by resembl of disposition;
and that elinor merit should not be acknowledg
by everi one who knew her wa to her comprehens imposs

edward ferrar wa not recommend to their good
opinion by ani peculiar grace of person or address
he wa not handsom and hi manner requir intimaci
to make them pleas he wa too diffid to do justic
to himself; but when hi natur shyness wa overcom
hi behaviour gave everi indic of an open
affection heart hi understand wa good
and hi educ had given it solid improv
but he wa neither fit by abil nor disposit
to answer the wish of hi mother and sister who long
to see him distinguished--as--they hardli knew what
they want him to make a fine figur in the world in some
manner or other hi mother wish to interest him in
polit concern to get him into parliament or to see
him connect with some of the great men of the day
mr john dashwood wish it likewise; but in the mean while
till one of these superior bless could be attain it would
have quiet her ambit to see him drive a barouch
but edward had no turn for great men or barouch
all hi wish center in domest comfort and the quiet
of privat life fortun he had a younger brother
who wa more promis

edward had been stay sever week in the hous
befor he engag much of mr dashwood attention;
for she wa at that time in such afflict as render
her careless of surround object she saw onli that he
wa quiet and unobtrus and she like him for it
he did not disturb the wretched of her mind by
ill-tim convers she wa first call to observ
and approv him farther by a reflect which elinor
chanc one day to make on the differ between him
and hi sister it wa a contrast which recommend him
most forcibl to her mother

it is enough said she; to say that he is unlik
fanni is enough it impli everyth amiabl
i love him alreadi

i think you will like him said elinor when you
know more of him

like him! repli her mother with a smile
i feel no sentiment of approb inferior to love

you may esteem him

i have never yet known what it wa to separ
esteem and love

mr dashwood now took pain to get acquaint with him
her manner were attach and soon banish hi reserv
she speedili comprehend all hi merits; the persuas
of hi regard for elinor perhap assist her penetration;
but she realli felt assur of hi worth: and even that
quiet of manner which milit against all her
establish idea of what a young man address ought to be
wa no longer uninterest when she knew hi heart to be
warm and hi temper affection

no sooner did she perceiv ani symptom of love
in hi behaviour to elinor than she consid their
seriou attach as certain and look forward
to their marriag as rapidli approach

in a few month my dear mariann said she
elinor will in all probabl be settl for life
we shall miss her; but she will be happi

oh! mamma how shall we do without her?

my love it will be scarc a separ
we shall live within a few mile of each other and shall
meet everi day of our live you will gain a brother
a real affection brother i have the highest opinion
in the world of edward heart but you look grave
marianne; do you disapprov your sister choice?

perhap said mariann i may consid it
with some surpris edward is veri amiabl and i love
him tenderli but yet--h is not the kind of young
man--ther is someth wanting--hi figur is not striking;
it ha none of that grace which i should expect
in the man who could serious attach my sister
hi eye want all that spirit that fire which at onc
announc virtu and intellig and besid all thi
i am afraid mamma he ha no real tast music seem
scarc to attract him and though he admir elinor
draw veri much it is not the admir of a person
who can understand their worth it is evid in spite of
hi frequent attent to her while she draw that in fact
he know noth of the matter he admir as a lover
not as a connoisseur to satisfi me those charact
must be unit i could not be happi with a man whose
tast did not in everi point coincid with my own
he must enter into all my feelings; the same book
the same music must charm us both oh! mama how spiritless
how tame wa edward manner in read to us last night!
i felt for my sister most sever yet she bore it
with so much composur she seem scarc to notic it
i could hardli keep my seat to hear those beauti line
which have frequent almost driven me wild pronounc
with such impenetr calm such dread indifference!--

he would certainli have done more justic to
simpl and eleg prose i thought so at the time;
but you would give him cowper

nay mamma if he is not to be anim by cowper!--
but we must allow for differ of tast elinor ha
not my feel and therefor she may overlook it and
be happi with him but it would have broke my heart
had i love him to hear him read with so littl sensibl
mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinc
that i shall never see a man whom i can realli love
i requir so much! he must have all edward virtu
and hi person and manner must ornament hi good
with everi possibl charm

rememb my love that you are not seventeen
it is yet too earli in life to despair of such a happi
whi should you be less fortun than your mother? in
one circumst onli my mariann may your destini be
differ from hers!



chapter 4


what a piti it is elinor said mariann
that edward should have no tast for draw

no tast for drawing! repli elinor whi should
you think so? he doe not draw himself inde but he ha
great pleasur in see the perform of other peopl
and i assur you he is by no mean defici in natur tast
though he ha not had opportun of improv it
had he ever been in the way of learn i think he would
have drawn veri well he distrust hi own judgment
in such matter so much that he is alway unwil
to give hi opinion on ani picture; but he ha an innat
proprieti and simplic of tast which in gener
direct him perfectli right

mariann wa afraid of offend and said no more
on the subject; but the kind of approb which elinor
describ as excit in him by the draw of other
peopl wa veri far from that raptur delight which
in her opinion could alon be call tast yet though
smile within herself at the mistak she honour
her sister for that blind partial to edward which produc it

i hope mariann continu elinor you do not
consid him as defici in gener tast inde i think
i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him
is perfectli cordial and if that were your opinion
i am sure you could never be civil to him

mariann hardli knew what to say she would
not wound the feel of her sister on ani account
and yet to say what she did not believ wa imposs
at length she replied:

do not be offend elinor if my prais of him
is not in everi thing equal to your sens of hi merit
i have not had so mani opportun of estim the minut
propens of hi mind hi inclin and tast
as you have; but i have the highest opinion in the world
of hi good and sens i think him everi thing that is
worthi and amiabl

i am sure repli elinor with a smile
that hi dearest friend could not be dissatisfi
with such commend as that i do not perceiv
how you could express yourself more warmli

mariann wa rejoic to find her sister so easili pleas

of hi sens and hi good continu elinor
no one can i think be in doubt who ha seen him
often enough to engag him in unreserv convers
the excel of hi understand and hi principl
can be conceal onli by that shyness which too often
keep him silent you know enough of him to do justic
to hi solid worth but of hi minut propens
as you call them you have from peculiar circumst
been kept more ignor than myself he and i have
been at time thrown a good deal togeth while you
have been wholli engross on the most affection
principl by my mother i have seen a great deal of him
have studi hi sentiment and heard hi opinion on
subject of literatur and taste; and upon the whole
i ventur to pronounc that hi mind is well-inform
enjoy of book exceedingli great hi imagin live
hi observ just and correct and hi tast delic
and pure hi abil in everi respect improv
as much upon acquaint as hi manner and person
at first sight hi address is certainli not striking;
and hi person can hardli be call handsom till the
express of hi eye which are uncommonli good
and the gener sweet of hi counten is perceiv
at present i know him so well that i think him
realli handsome; or at least almost so what say you
marianne?

i shall veri soon think him handsom elinor if i
do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother
i shall no more see imperfect in hi face than i now do
in hi heart

elinor start at thi declar and wa sorri for
the warmth she had been betray into in speak of him
she felt that edward stood veri high in her opinion
she believ the regard to be mutual; but she requir
greater certainti of it to make mariann convict
of their attach agreeabl to her she knew that
what mariann and her mother conjectur one moment
they believ the next--that with them to wish wa to hope
and to hope wa to expect she tri to explain the real
state of the case to her sister

i do not attempt to deni said she that i think
veri highli of him--that i greatli esteem that i like him

mariann here burst forth with indignation--

esteem him! like him! cold-heart elinor! oh!
wors than cold-hearted! asham of be otherwis
use those word again and i will leav the room thi moment

elinor could not help laugh excus me
said she; and be assur that i meant no offenc to you
by speak in so quiet a way of my own feel
believ them to be stronger than i have declared;
believ them in short to be such as hi merit and the
suspicion--th hope of hi affect for me may warrant
without imprud or folli but farther than thi you must
not believ i am by no mean assur of hi regard for me
there are moment when the extent of it seem doubtful;
and till hi sentiment are fulli known you cannot wonder
at my wish to avoid ani encourag of my own partial
by believ or call it more than it is in my heart
i feel little--scarc ani doubt of hi prefer
but there are other point to be consid besid
hi inclin he is veri far from be independ
what hi mother realli is we cannot know; but from fanni
occasion mention of her conduct and opinion we have
never been dispos to think her amiable; and i am veri
much mistaken if edward is not himself awar that there
would be mani difficulti in hi way if he were to wish
to marri a woman who had not either a great fortun or
high rank

mariann wa astonish to find how much the imagin
of her mother and herself had outstrip the truth

and you realli are not engag to him! said she
yet it certainli soon will happen but two advantag
will proceed from thi delay i shall not lose you so soon
and edward will have greater opportun of improv
that natur tast for your favourit pursuit which must
be so indispens necessari to your futur felic
oh! if he should be so far stimul by your geniu as to
learn to draw himself how delight it would be!

elinor had given her real opinion to her sister
she could not consid her partial for edward
in so prosper a state as mariann had believ it
there wa at time a want of spirit about him which
if it did not denot indiffer spoke of someth almost
as unpromis a doubt of her regard suppos him
to feel it need not give him more than inquietud
it would not be like to produc that deject of mind
which frequent attend him a more reason caus
might be found in the depend situat which forbad
the indulg of hi affect she knew that hi mother
neither behav to him so as to make hi home comfort
at present nor to give him ani assur that he might form
a home for himself without strictli attend to her view
for hi aggrandiz with such a knowledg as thi
it wa imposs for elinor to feel easi on the subject
she wa far from depend on that result of hi prefer
of her which her mother and sister still consid
as certain nay the longer they were togeth the more
doubt seem the natur of hi regard; and sometim
for a few pain minut she believ it to be no more
than friendship

but whatev might realli be it limit it wa enough
when perceiv by hi sister to make her uneasi
and at the same time (which wa still more common)
to make her uncivil she took the first opportun of
affront her mother-in-law on the occas talk to
her so express of her brother great expect
of mr ferrarss resolut that both her son should
marri well and of the danger attend ani young woman
who attempt to draw him in; that mr dashwood could
neither pretend to be unconsci nor endeavor to be calm
she gave her an answer which mark her contempt
and instantli left the room resolv that whatev might
be the inconveni or expens of so sudden a remov
her belov elinor should not be expos anoth week
to such insinu

in thi state of her spirit a letter wa deliv
to her from the post which contain a propos
particularli well time it wa the offer of a small hous
on veri easi term belong to a relat of her own
a gentleman of consequ and properti in devonshir
the letter wa from thi gentleman himself and written
in the true spirit of friendli accommod
he understood that she wa in need of a dwelling;
and though the hous he now offer her wa mere a cottag
he assur her that everyth should be done to it which
she might think necessari if the situat pleas her
he earnestli press her after give the particular
of the hous and garden to come with her daughter to
barton park the place of hi own resid from whenc
she might judg herself whether barton cottag for the
hous were in the same parish could by ani alter
be made comfort to her he seem realli anxiou to
accommod them and the whole of hi letter wa written
in so friendli a style as could not fail of give pleasur
to hi cousin; more especi at a moment when she wa
suffer under the cold and unfeel behaviour of her
nearer connect she need no time for deliber
or inquiri her resolut wa form as she read
the situat of barton in a counti so far distant from
sussex as devonshir which but a few hour befor
would have been a suffici object to outweigh everi
possibl advantag belong to the place wa now it
first recommend to quit the neighbourhood of norland
wa no longer an evil; it wa an object of desire;
it wa a bless in comparison of the miseri of continu
her daughter-in-law guest; and to remov for ever
from that belov place would be less pain than to
inhabit or visit it while such a woman wa it mistress
she instantli wrote sir john middleton her acknowledg
of hi kind and her accept of hi proposal;
and then hasten to shew both letter to her daughter
that she might be secur of their approb befor her
answer were sent

elinor had alway thought it would be more prudent
for them to settl at some distanc from norland
than immedi amongst their present acquaint
on that head therefor it wa not for her to oppos
her mother intent of remov into devonshir
the hous too as describ by sir john wa on so
simpl a scale and the rent so uncommonli moder
as to leav her no right of object on either point;
and therefor though it wa not a plan which brought
ani charm to her fanci though it wa a remov from
the vicin of norland beyond her wish she made
no attempt to dissuad her mother from send a letter
of acquiesc



chapter 5


no sooner wa her answer dispatch than mr dashwood
indulg herself in the pleasur of announc to her
son-in-law and hi wife that she wa provid with a hous
and should incommod them no longer than till everi thing were
readi for her inhabit it they heard her with surpris
mr john dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilli
hope that she would not be settl far from norland
she had great satisfact in repli that she wa go
into devonshire--edward turn hastili toward her
on hear thi and in a voic of surpris and concern
which requir no explan to her repeat
devonshire! are you inde go there? so far from hence!
and to what part of it? she explain the situat
it wa within four mile northward of exet

it is but a cottag she continu but i hope
to see mani of my friend in it a room or two can
easili be added; and if my friend find no difficulti
in travel so far to see me i am sure i will find
none in accommod them

she conclud with a veri kind invit to
mr and mr john dashwood to visit her at barton;
and to edward she gave one with still greater affect
though her late convers with her daughter-in-law had
made her resolv on remain at norland no longer than
wa unavoid it had not produc the smallest effect
on her in that point to which it princip tend
to separ edward and elinor wa as far from be her
object as ever; and she wish to show mr john dashwood
by thi point invit to her brother how total she
disregard her disapprob of the match

mr john dashwood told hi mother again and again
how exceedingli sorri he wa that she had taken a hous at
such a distanc from norland as to prevent hi be of ani
servic to her in remov her furnitur he realli felt
conscienti vex on the occasion; for the veri exert
to which he had limit the perform of hi promis to
hi father wa by thi arrang render impracticable--
the furnitur wa all sent around by water it chiefli
consist of household linen plate china and book
with a handsom pianofort of mariann mr john
dashwood saw the packag depart with a sigh: she could
not help feel it hard that as mr dashwood incom
would be so trifl in comparison with their own
she should have ani handsom articl of furnitur

mr dashwood took the hous for a twelvemonth; it wa
readi furnish and she might have immedi possess
no difficulti aros on either side in the agreement; and she
wait onli for the dispos of her effect at norland
and to determin her futur household befor she set
off for the west; and thi as she wa exceedingli rapid
in the perform of everyth that interest her
wa soon done--th hors which were left her by her husband
had been sold soon after hi death and an opportun
now offer of dispos of her carriag she agre
to sell that likewis at the earnest advic of her
eldest daughter for the comfort of her children had she
consult onli her own wish she would have kept it;
but the discret of elinor prevail her wisdom
too limit the number of their servant to three;
two maid and a man with whom they were speedili provid
from amongst those who had form their establish
at norland

the man and one of the maid were sent off immedi
into devonshir to prepar the hous for their mistresss
arrival; for as ladi middleton wa entir unknown
to mr dashwood she prefer go directli to the
cottag to be a visitor at barton park; and she reli
so undoubtingli on sir john descript of the hous
as to feel no curios to examin it herself till she
enter it as her own her eager to be gone from norland
wa preserv from diminut by the evid satisfact
of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;
a satisfact which wa but feebli attempt to be conceal
under a cold invit to her to defer her departur
now wa the time when her son-in-law promis to hi
father might with particular proprieti be fulfil
sinc he had neglect to do it on first come to
the estat their quit hi hous might be look
on as the most suitabl period for it accomplish
but mr dashwood began shortli to give over everi
hope of the kind and to be convinc from the gener
drift of hi discours that hi assist extend no
farther than their mainten for six month at norland
he so frequent talk of the increas expens
of housekeep and of the perpetu demand upon hi purs
which a man of ani consequ in the world wa beyond
calcul expos to that he seem rather to stand
in need of more money himself than to have ani design of
give money away

in a veri few week from the day which brought sir
john middleton first letter to norland everi thing wa
so far settl in their futur abod as to enabl
mr dashwood and her daughter to begin their journey

mani were the tear shed by them in their last
adieu to a place so much belov dear dear norland!
said mariann as she wander alon befor the hous
on the last even of their be there; when shall i ceas
to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--oh!
happi hous could you know what i suffer in now view
you from thi spot from whenc perhap i may view
you no more!--and you ye well-known trees!--but you
will continu the same--no leaf will decay becaus we
are remov nor ani branch becom motionless although we
can observ you no longer!--no; you will continu the same;
unconsci of the pleasur or the regret you occas
and insens of ani chang in those who walk under your
shade!--but who will remain to enjoy you?



chapter 6


the first part of their journey wa perform in too
melancholi a disposit to be otherwis than tediou
and unpleas but as they drew toward the end of it
their interest in the appear of a countri which they
were to inhabit overcam their deject and a view of
barton valley as they enter it gave them cheer
it wa a pleasant fertil spot well wood and rich
in pastur after wind along it for more than a mile
they reach their own hous a small green court wa
the whole of it demesn in front; and a neat wicket gate
admit them into it

as a hous barton cottag though small wa comfort
and compact; but as a cottag it wa defect for the
build wa regular the roof wa tile the window
shutter were not paint green nor were the wall cover
with honeysuckl a narrow passag led directli through
the hous into the garden behind on each side of the
entranc wa a sit room about sixteen feet square;
and beyond them were the offic and the stair
four bed-room and two garret form the rest of the hous
it had not been built mani year and wa in good repair
in comparison of norland it wa poor and small indeed!--but
the tear which recollect call forth as they enter
the hous were soon dri away they were cheer
by the joy of the servant on their arriv and each
for the sake of the other resolv to appear happi
it wa veri earli in september; the season wa fine
and from first see the place under the advantag
of good weather they receiv an impress in it
favour which wa of materi servic in recommend
it to their last approb

the situat of the hous wa good high hill rose
immedi behind and at no great distanc on each side;
some of which were open down the other cultiv and woodi
the villag of barton wa chiefli on one of these hill
and form a pleasant view from the cottag window
the prospect in front wa more extensive; it command the
whole of the valley and reach into the countri beyond
the hill which surround the cottag termin
the valley in that direction; under anoth name
and in anoth cours it branch out again between two
of the steepest of them

with the size and furnitur of the hous mr dashwood
wa upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former
style of life render mani addit to the latter
indispens yet to add and improv wa a delight to her;
and she had at thi time readi money enough to suppli all
that wa want of greater eleg to the apart
as for the hous itself to be sure said she it is
too small for our famili but we will make ourselv
toler comfort for the present as it is too late
in the year for improv perhap in the spring
if i have plenti of money as i dare say i shall we may
think about build these parlor are both too small
for such parti of our friend as i hope to see often
collect here; and i have some thought of throw the
passag into one of them with perhap a part of the other
and so leav the remaind of that other for an entrance;
thi with a new draw room which may be easili ad
and a bed-chamb and garret abov will make it a veri snug
littl cottag i could wish the stair were handsom
but one must not expect everi thing; though i suppos it
would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see
how much i am before-hand with the world in the spring
and we will plan our improv accordingli

in the mean time till all these alter could
be made from the save of an incom of five hundr
a-year by a woman who never save in her life they were
wise enough to be content with the hous as it was;
and each of them wa busi in arrang their particular
concern and endeavor by place around them book
and other possess to form themselv a home
mariann pianofort wa unpack and properli dispos of;
and elinor draw were affix to the wall of their
sit room

in such employ as these they were interrupt
soon after breakfast the next day by the entranc of
their landlord who call to welcom them to barton
and to offer them everi accommod from hi own hous
and garden in which their might at present be defici
sir john middleton wa a good look man about forti
he had formerli visit at stanhil but it wa too long
for hi young cousin to rememb him hi counten
wa thoroughli good-humoured; and hi manner were
as friendli as the style of hi letter their arriv
seem to afford him real satisfact and their comfort
to be an object of real solicitud to him he said much
of hi earnest desir of their live in the most sociabl
term with hi famili and press them so cordial
to dine at barton park everi day till they were better
settl at home that though hi entreati were carri
to a point of persever beyond civil they could
not give offenc hi kind wa not confin to words;
for within an hour after he left them a larg basket
full of garden stuff and fruit arriv from the park
which wa follow befor the end of the day by a present
of game he insist moreov on convey all their
letter to and from the post for them and would not be
deni the satisfact of send them hi newspap
everi day

ladi middleton had sent a veri civil messag by him
denot her intent of wait on mr dashwood as soon as
she could be assur that her visit would be no inconvenience;
and as thi messag wa answer by an invit
equal polit her ladyship wa introduc to them the next day

they were of cours veri anxiou to see a person on
whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend; and the
eleg of her appear wa favour to their wish
ladi middleton wa not more than six or seven and twenty;
her face wa handsom her figur tall and strike
and her address grace her manner had all the eleg
which her husband want but they would have been
improv by some share of hi frank and warmth;
and her visit wa long enough to detract someth from
their first admir by shew that though perfectli
well-br she wa reserv cold and had noth to say
for herself beyond the most common-plac inquiri or remark

convers howev wa not want for sir john
wa veri chatti and ladi middleton had taken the wise
precaut of bring with her their eldest child a fine
littl boy about six year old by which mean there wa
one subject alway to be recur to by the ladi in case
of extrem for they had to enquir hi name and age
admir hi beauti and ask him question which hi mother
answer for him while he hung about her and held
down hi head to the great surpris of her ladyship
who wonder at hi be so shi befor compani as he
could make nois enough at home on everi formal visit
a child ought to be of the parti by way of provis
for discours in the present case it took up ten minut
to determin whether the boy were most like hi father
or mother and in what particular he resembl either
for of cours everi bodi differ and everi bodi wa
astonish at the opinion of the other

an opportun wa soon to be given to the dashwood
of debat on the rest of the children as sir john
would not leav the hous without secur their promis
of dine at the park the next day



chapter 7


barton park wa about half a mile from the cottag
the ladi had pass near it in their way along the valley
but it wa screen from their view at home by the
project of a hill the hous wa larg and handsome;
and the middleton live in a style of equal hospit
and eleg the former wa for sir john gratif
the latter for that of hi ladi they were scarc
ever without some friend stay with them in the hous
and they kept more compani of everi kind than ani other
famili in the neighbourhood it wa necessari to the
happi of both; for howev dissimilar in temper
and outward behaviour they strongli resembl each other
in that total want of talent and tast which confin
their employ unconnect with such as societi produc
within a veri narrow compass sir john wa a sportsman
ladi middleton a mother he hunt and shot and she
humour her children; and these were their onli resourc
ladi middleton had the advantag of be abl to spoil her
children all the year round while sir john independ
employ were in exist onli half the time
continu engag at home and abroad howev
suppli all the defici of natur and education;
support the good spirit of sir john and gave exercis
to the good breed of hi wife

ladi middleton piqu herself upon the eleg
of her tabl and of all her domest arrangements;
and from thi kind of vaniti wa her greatest enjoy
in ani of their parti but sir john satisfact
in societi wa much more real; he delight in collect
about him more young peopl than hi hous would hold
and the noisier they were the better wa he pleas
he wa a bless to all the juvenil part of the neighbourhood
for in summer he wa for ever form parti to eat cold
ham and chicken out of door and in winter hi privat
ball were numer enough for ani young ladi who wa not
suffer under the unsati appetit of fifteen

the arriv of a new famili in the countri wa alway
a matter of joy to him and in everi point of view he wa
charm with the inhabit he had now procur for hi
cottag at barton the miss dashwood were young pretti
and unaffect it wa enough to secur hi good opinion;
for to be unaffect wa all that a pretti girl could
want to make her mind as captiv as her person
the friendli of hi disposit made him happi in
accommod those whose situat might be consid
in comparison with the past as unfortun in show
kind to hi cousin therefor he had the real satisfact
of a good heart; and in settl a famili of femal onli
in hi cottag he had all the satisfact of a sportsman;
for a sportsman though he esteem onli those of hi sex who
are sportsmen likewis is not often desir of encourag
their tast by admit them to a resid within hi own
manor

mr dashwood and her daughter were met at the door
of the hous by sir john who welcom them to barton
park with unaffect sincerity; and as he attend them
to the draw room repeat to the young ladi the concern
which the same subject had drawn from him the day befor
at be unabl to get ani smart young men to meet them
they would see he said onli one gentleman there
besid himself; a particular friend who wa stay at
the park but who wa neither veri young nor veri gay
he hope they would all excus the small of the parti
and could assur them it should never happen so again
he had been to sever famili that morn in hope
of procur some addit to their number but it
wa moonlight and everi bodi wa full of engag
luckili ladi middleton mother had arriv at barton
within the last hour and as she wa a veri cheer
agreeabl woman he hope the young ladi would not find
it so veri dull as they might imagin the young ladi
as well as their mother were perfectli satisfi with
have two entir stranger of the parti and wish for
no more

mr jen ladi middleton mother wa a
good-humour merri fat elderli woman who talk a
great deal seem veri happi and rather vulgar she wa full
of joke and laughter and befor dinner wa over had said
mani witti thing on the subject of lover and husbands;
hope they had not left their heart behind them in sussex
and pretend to see them blush whether they did or not
mariann wa vex at it for her sister sake and turn
her eye toward elinor to see how she bore these attack
with an earnest which gave elinor far more pain than
could aris from such common-plac railleri as mr jenningss

colonel brandon the friend of sir john seem no
more adapt by resembl of manner to be hi friend
than ladi middleton wa to be hi wife or mr jen
to be ladi middleton mother he wa silent and grave
hi appear howev wa not unpleas in spite
of hi be in the opinion of mariann and margaret
an absolut old bachelor for he wa on the wrong side
of five and thirty; but though hi face wa not handsom
hi counten wa sensibl and hi address wa
particularli gentlemanlik

there wa noth in ani of the parti which could
recommend them as companion to the dashwoods; but the cold
insipid of ladi middleton wa so particularli repuls
that in comparison of it the graviti of colonel brandon
and even the boister mirth of sir john and hi
mother-in-law wa interest ladi middleton seem
to be rous to enjoy onli by the entranc of her
four noisi children after dinner who pull her about
tore her cloth and put an end to everi kind of discours
except what relat to themselv

in the even as mariann wa discov to be music
she wa invit to play the instrument wa unlock
everi bodi prepar to be charm and mariann
who sang veri well at their request went through the
chief of the song which ladi middleton had brought into
the famili on her marriag and which perhap had lain
ever sinc in the same posit on the pianofort
for her ladyship had celebr that event by give
up music although by her mother account she had
play extrem well and by her own wa veri fond of it

mariann perform wa highli applaud
sir john wa loud in hi admir at the end of everi song
and as loud in hi convers with the other while everi
song last ladi middleton frequent call him to order
wonder how ani one attent could be divert from music
for a moment and ask mariann to sing a particular song
which mariann had just finish colonel brandon alon
of all the parti heard her without be in raptur
he paid her onli the compliment of attention; and she felt
a respect for him on the occas which the other had
reason forfeit by their shameless want of tast
hi pleasur in music though it amount not to that
ecstat delight which alon could sympath with her own
wa estim when contrast against the horribl
insens of the others; and she wa reason enough
to allow that a man of five and thirti might well have
outliv all acut of feel and everi exquisit
power of enjoy she wa perfectli dispos to make
everi allow for the colonel advanc state of life
which human requir



chapter 8


mr jen wa a widow with an ampl jointur
she had onli two daughter both of whom she had live
to see respect marri and she had now therefor
noth to do but to marri all the rest of the world
in the promot of thi object she wa zealous activ
as far as her abil reached; and miss no opportun
of project wed among all the young peopl
of her acquaint she wa remark quick in the
discoveri of attach and had enjoy the advantag
of rais the blush and the vaniti of mani a young
ladi by insinu of her power over such a young man;
and thi kind of discern enabl her soon after her
arriv at barton decis to pronounc that colonel
brandon wa veri much in love with mariann dashwood
she rather suspect it to be so on the veri first
even of their be togeth from hi listen
so attent while she sang to them; and when the visit
wa return by the middleton dine at the cottag
the fact wa ascertain by hi listen to her again
it must be so she wa perfectli convinc of it
it would be an excel match for he wa rich and she
wa handsom mr jen had been anxiou to see
colonel brandon well marri ever sinc her connect
with sir john first brought him to her knowledge;
and she wa alway anxiou to get a good husband for everi
pretti girl

the immedi advantag to herself wa by no mean
inconsider for it suppli her with endless joke
against them both at the park she laugh at the colonel
and in the cottag at mariann to the former her
railleri wa probabl as far as it regard onli himself
perfectli indifferent; but to the latter it wa at
first incomprehensible; and when it object wa understood
she hardli knew whether most to laugh at it absurd
or censur it impertin for she consid it as an
unfeel reflect on the colonel advanc year
and on hi forlorn condit as an old bachelor

mr dashwood who could not think a man five year
younger than herself so exceedingli ancient as he appear
to the youth fanci of her daughter ventur to clear
mr jen from the probabl of wish to throw
ridicul on hi age

but at least mamma you cannot deni the absurd
of the accus though you may not think it intent
ill-natur colonel brandon is certainli younger than
mr jen but he is old enough to be my father;
and if he were ever anim enough to be in love
must have long outliv everi sensat of the kind
it is too ridiculous! when is a man to be safe from such wit
if age and infirm will not protect him?

infirmity! said elinor do you call colonel brandon
infirm? i can easili suppos that hi age may appear much
greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardli
deceiv yourself as to hi have the use of hi limbs!

did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?
and is not that the commonest infirm of declin life?

my dearest child said her mother laugh
at thi rate you must be in continu terror of my decay;
and it must seem to you a miracl that my life ha been
extend to the advanc age of forti

mamma you are not do me justic i know veri well
that colonel brandon is not old enough to make hi friend
yet apprehens of lose him in the cours of natur
he may live twenti year longer but thirty-f ha
noth to do with matrimoni

perhap said elinor thirty-f and seventeen had
better not have ani thing to do with matrimoni togeth
but if there should by ani chanc happen to be a woman
who is singl at seven and twenti i should not think
colonel brandon be thirty-f ani object to hi
marri her

a woman of seven and twenti said mariann
after paus a moment can never hope to feel or inspir
affect again and if her home be uncomfort
or her fortun small i can suppos that she might
bring herself to submit to the offic of a nurs
for the sake of the provis and secur of a wife
in hi marri such a woman therefor there would be
noth unsuit it would be a compact of conveni
and the world would be satisfi in my eye it would
be no marriag at all but that would be noth
to me it would seem onli a commerci exchang in which
each wish to be benefit at the expens of the other

it would be imposs i know repli elinor
to convinc you that a woman of seven and twenti could
feel for a man of thirty-f anyth near enough
to love to make him a desir companion to her
but i must object to your doom colonel brandon and
hi wife to the constant confin of a sick chamber
mere becaus he chanc to complain yesterday (a
veri cold damp day) of a slight rheumat feel in one
of hi shoulder

but he talk of flannel waistcoat said marianne;
and with me a flannel waistcoat is invari connect
with ach cramp rheumat and everi speci of
ailment that can afflict the old and the feebl

had he been onli in a violent fever you would not
have despis him half so much confess mariann is not
there someth interest to you in the flush cheek
hollow eye and quick puls of a fever?

soon after thi upon elinor leav the room
mamma said mariann i have an alarm on the subject
of ill which i cannot conceal from you i am sure
edward ferrar is not well we have now been here almost
a fortnight and yet he doe not come noth but real
indisposit could occas thi extraordinari delay
what els can detain him at norland?

had you ani idea of hi come so soon?
said mr dashwood i had none on the contrari
if i have felt ani anxieti at all on the subject it ha
been in recollect that he sometim show a want
of pleasur and readi in accept my invit
when i talk of hi come to barton doe elinor
expect him already?

i have never mention it to her but of cours
she must

i rather think you are mistaken for when i
wa talk to her yesterday of get a new grate
for the spare bedchamb she observ that there
wa no immedi hurri for it as it wa not like
that the room would be want for some time

how strang thi is! what can be the mean of it!
but the whole of their behaviour to each other ha been
unaccountable! how cold how compos were their last
adieus! how languid their convers the last even
of their be together! in edward farewel there wa no
distinct between elinor and me: it wa the good wish
of an affection brother to both twice did i leav
them purpos togeth in the cours of the last morn
and each time did he most unaccount follow me out
of the room and elinor in quit norland and edward
cri not as i did even now her self-command is invari
when is she deject or melancholy? when doe she tri
to avoid societi or appear restless and dissatisfi
in it?



chapter 9


the dashwood were now settl at barton with toler
comfort to themselv the hous and the garden with all
the object surround them were now becom familiar
and the ordinari pursuit which had given to norland
half it charm were engag in again with far greater
enjoy than norland had been abl to afford sinc the
loss of their father sir john middleton who call
on them everi day for the first fortnight and who wa
not in the habit of see much occup at home
could not conceal hi amaz on find them alway employ

their visitor except those from barton park
were not many; for in spite of sir john urgent entreati
that they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeat
assur of hi carriag be alway at their servic
the independ of mr dashwood spirit overcam the
wish of societi for her children; and she wa resolut
in declin to visit ani famili beyond the distanc
of a walk there were but few who could be so classed;
and it wa not all of them that were attain
about a mile and a half from the cottag along the narrow
wind valley of allenham which issu from that of barton
as formerli describ the girl had in one of their
earliest walk discov an ancient respect look
mansion which by remind them a littl of norland
interest their imagin and made them wish to be
better acquaint with it but they learnt on enquiri
that it possessor an elderli ladi of veri good charact
wa unfortun too infirm to mix with the world
and never stir from home

the whole countri about them abound in beauti walk
the high down which invit them from almost everi window
of the cottag to seek the exquisit enjoy of air
on their summit were a happi altern when the dirt
of the valley beneath shut up their superior beauties;
and toward one of these hill did mariann and margaret
one memor morn direct their step attract by the
partial sunshin of a showeri sky and unabl longer to bear
the confin which the settl rain of the two preced
day had occas the weather wa not tempt enough
to draw the two other from their pencil and their book
in spite of mariann declar that the day would
be lastingli fair and that everi threaten cloud would
be drawn off from their hills; and the two girl set off
togeth

they gaili ascend the down rejoic in their own
penetr at everi glimps of blue sky; and when they
caught in their face the anim gale of a high
south-westerli wind they piti the fear which had prevent
their mother and elinor from share such delight sensat

is there a felic in the world said mariann
superior to this?--margaret we will walk here at least
two hour

margaret agre and they pursu their way against
the wind resist it with laugh delight for about
twenti minut longer when suddenli the cloud unit over
their head and a drive rain set full in their face--
chagrin and surpris they were oblig though unwillingli
to turn back for no shelter wa nearer than their own hous
one consol howev remain for them to which the
exig of the moment gave more than usual propriety;
it wa that of run with all possibl speed down the steep
side of the hill which led immedi to their garden gate

they set off mariann had at first the advantag
but a fals step brought her suddenli to the ground;
and margaret unabl to stop herself to assist her
wa involuntarili hurri along and reach the bottom
in safeti

a gentleman carri a gun with two pointer
play round him wa pass up the hill and within
a few yard of mariann when her accid happen
he put down hi gun and ran to her assist she had
rais herself from the ground but her foot had been
twist in her fall and she wa scarc abl to stand
the gentleman offer hi services; and perceiv that her
modesti declin what her situat render necessari
took her up in hi arm without farther delay and carri
her down the hill then pass through the garden
the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her
directli into the hous whither margaret wa just arriv
and quit not hi hold till he had seat her in a chair
in the parlour

elinor and her mother rose up in amaz at
their entranc and while the eye of both were fix
on him with an evid wonder and a secret admir
which equal sprung from hi appear he apolog
for hi intrus by relat it caus in a manner
so frank and so grace that hi person which wa
uncommonli handsom receiv addit charm from hi voic
and express had he been even old ugli and vulgar
the gratitud and kind of mr dashwood would
have been secur by ani act of attent to her child;
but the influenc of youth beauti and eleg
gave an interest to the action which came home to her feel

she thank him again and again; and with a sweet
of address which alway attend her invit him to
be seat but thi he declin as he wa dirti and wet
mr dashwood then beg to know to whom she wa oblig
hi name he repli wa willoughbi and hi present
home wa at allenham from whenc he hope she would
allow him the honour of call tomorrow to enquir
after miss dashwood the honour wa readili grant
and he then depart to make himself still more interest
in the midst of a heavi rain

hi manli beauti and more than common grace
were instantli the theme of gener admir
and the laugh which hi gallantri rais against mariann
receiv particular spirit from hi exterior attractions--
mariann herself had seen less of hi person that the rest
for the confus which crimson over her face on hi
lift her up had rob her of the power of regard
him after their enter the hous but she had seen
enough of him to join in all the admir of the other
and with an energi which alway adorn her prais
hi person and air were equal to what her fanci had ever
drawn for the hero of a favourit story; and in hi carri
her into the hous with so littl previou formal there
wa a rapid of thought which particularli recommend
the action to her everi circumst belong to him
wa interest hi name wa good hi resid wa in
their favourit villag and she soon found out that of all
manli dress a shooting-jacket wa the most becom
her imagin wa busi her reflect were pleasant
and the pain of a sprain ankl wa disregard

sir john call on them as soon as the next interv
of fair weather that morn allow him to get out
of doors; and mariann accid be relat to him
he wa eagerli ask whether he knew ani gentleman
of the name of willoughbi at allenham

willoughby! cri sir john; what is he
in the country? that is good news however; i will
ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday

you know him then said mr dashwood

know him! to be sure i do whi he is down here
everi year

and what sort of a young man is he?

as good a kind of fellow as ever live i assur you
a veri decent shot and there is not a bolder rider
in england

and is that all you can say for him? cri mariann
indignantli but what are hi manner on more intim
acquaintance? what hi pursuit hi talent and genius?

sir john wa rather puzzl

upon my soul said he i do not know much about him
as to all that but he is a pleasant good humour fellow
and ha got the nicest littl black bitch of a pointer
i ever saw wa she out with him today?

but mariann could no more satisfi him as to the
colour of mr willoughbi pointer than he could
describ to her the shade of hi mind

but who is he? said elinor where doe he come
from? ha he a hous at allenham?

on thi point sir john could give more certain intelligence;
and he told them that mr willoughbi had no properti
of hi own in the country; that he resid there onli
while he wa visit the old ladi at allenham court
to whom he wa relat and whose possess he wa
to inherit; ad ye ye he is veri well worth
catch i can tell you miss dashwood; he ha a pretti
littl estat of hi own in somersetshir besides;
and if i were you i would not give him up to my
younger sister in spite of all thi tumbl down hill
miss mariann must not expect to have all the men to herself
brandon will be jealou if she doe not take care

i do not believ said mr dashwood with a
good humour smile that mr willoughbi will be incommod
by the attempt of either of my daughter toward what
you call catch him it is not an employ to which
they have been brought up men are veri safe with us
let them be ever so rich i am glad to find howev
from what you say that he is a respect young man
and one whose acquaint will not be inelig

he is as good a sort of fellow i believ
as ever live repeat sir john i rememb
last christma at a littl hop at the park he danc
from eight oclock till four without onc sit down

did he indeed? cri mariann with sparkl eye
and with eleg with spirit?

yes; and he wa up again at eight to ride to covert

that is what i like; that is what a young man ought
to be whatev be hi pursuit hi eager in them
should know no moder and leav him no sens of fatigu

aye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see
how it will be you will be set your cap at him now
and never think of poor brandon

that is an express sir john said mariann
warmli which i particularli dislik i abhor everi
common-plac phrase by which wit is intended; and set
one cap at a man or make a conquest are the most
odiou of all their tendenc is gross and illiberal;
and if their construct could ever be deem clever
time ha long ago destroy all it ingenu

sir john did not much understand thi reproof;
but he laugh as heartili as if he did and then repli

ay you will make conquest enough i dare say
one way or other poor brandon! he is quit smitten alreadi
and he is veri well worth set your cap at i can
tell you in spite of all thi tumbl about and sprain
of ankl



chapter 10


mariann preserv as margaret with more eleg
than precis style willoughbi call at the cottag
earli the next morn to make hi person enquiri
he wa receiv by mr dashwood with more than politeness;
with a kind which sir john account of him and her own
gratitud prompted; and everi thing that pass dure
the visit tend to assur him of the sens eleg
mutual affect and domest comfort of the famili
to whom accid had now introduc him of their
person charm he had not requir a second interview
to be convinc

miss dashwood had a delic complexion
regular featur and a remark pretti figur
mariann wa still handsom her form though not so
correct as her sister in have the advantag of height
wa more striking; and her face wa so love that when
in the common cant of prais she wa call a beauti girl
truth wa less violent outrag than usual happen
her skin wa veri brown but from it transpar
her complexion wa uncommonli brilliant; her featur
were all good; her smile wa sweet and attractive;
and in her eye which were veri dark there wa a life
a spirit an eager which could hardili be seen
without delight from willoughbi their express wa at
first held back by the embarrass which the remembr
of hi assist creat but when thi pass away
when her spirit becam collect when she saw that to the
perfect good-breed of the gentleman he unit frank
and vivac and abov all when she heard him declar
that of music and danc he wa passion fond
she gave him such a look of approb as secur the
largest share of hi discours to herself for the rest
of hi stay

it wa onli necessari to mention ani favourit
amus to engag her to talk she could not be
silent when such point were introduc and she
had neither shyness nor reserv in their discuss
they speedili discov that their enjoy of danc
and music wa mutual and that it aros from a gener
conform of judgment in all that relat to either
encourag by thi to a further examin of hi opinion
she proceed to question him on the subject of books;
her favourit author were brought forward and dwelt
upon with so raptur a delight that ani young man of
five and twenti must have been insens inde not to
becom an immedi convert to the excel of such work
howev disregard befor their tast wa strikingli alik
the same book the same passag were idol by each--
or if ani differ appear ani object aros
it last no longer than till the forc of her argument
and the bright of her eye could be display
he acquiesc in all her decis caught all her enthusiasm;
and long befor hi visit conclud they convers
with the familiar of a long-establish acquaint

well mariann said elinor as soon as he had left them
for one morn i think you have done pretti well
you have alreadi ascertain mr willoughbi opinion in
almost everi matter of import you know what he think
of cowper and scott; you are certain of hi estim
their beauti as he ought and you have receiv everi
assur of hi admir pope no more than is proper
but how is your acquaint to be long support under such
extraordinari despatch of everi subject for discourse?
you will soon have exhaust each favourit topic
anoth meet will suffic to explain hi sentiment
on picturesqu beauti and second marriag and then
you can have noth farther to ask--

elinor cri mariann is thi fair? is thi
just? are my idea so scanty? but i see what you mean
i have been too much at my eas too happi too frank
i have er against everi common-plac notion of decorum;
i have been open and sincer where i ought to have
been reserv spiritless dull and deceitful--had
i talk onli of the weather and the road and had i
spoken onli onc in ten minut thi reproach would have
been spare

my love said her mother you must not be offend
with elinor--sh wa onli in jest i should scold
her myself if she were capabl of wish to check
the delight of your convers with our new friend--
mariann wa soften in a moment

willoughbi on hi side gave everi proof of hi
pleasur in their acquaint which an evid wish
of improv it could offer he came to them everi day
to enquir after mariann wa at first hi excuse; but the
encourag of hi recept to which everi day gave
greater kind made such an excus unnecessari befor it
had ceas to be possibl by mariann perfect recoveri
she wa confin for some day to the house; but never had
ani confin been less irksom willoughbi wa a young
man of good abil quick imagin live spirit
and open affection manner he wa exactli form
to engag mariann heart for with all thi he join
not onli a captiv person but a natur ardour
of mind which wa now rous and increas by the exampl
of her own and which recommend him to her affect
beyond everi thing els

hi societi becam gradual her most exquisit enjoy
they read they talk they sang together; hi music
talent were considerable; and he read with all the
sensibl and spirit which edward had unfortun want

in mr dashwood estim he wa as faultless
as in mariannes; and elinor saw noth to censur in him
but a propens in which he strongli resembl and peculiarli
delight her sister of say too much what he thought on
everi occas without attent to person or circumst
in hastili form and give hi opinion of other peopl
in sacrif gener polit to the enjoy
of undivid attent where hi heart wa engag
and in slight too easili the form of worldli proprieti
he display a want of caution which elinor could not approv
in spite of all that he and mariann could say in it support

mariann began now to perceiv that the desper
which had seiz her at sixteen and a half of ever
see a man who could satisfi her idea of perfect
had been rash and unjustifi willoughbi wa all
that her fanci had delin in that unhappi hour
and in everi brighter period as capabl of attach her;
and hi behaviour declar hi wish to be in that respect
as earnest as hi abil were strong

her mother too in whose mind not one specul
thought of their marriag had been rais by hi prospect
of rich wa led befor the end of a week to hope and
expect it; and secretli to congratul herself on have
gain two such sons-in-law as edward and willoughbi

colonel brandon partial for mariann which had
so earli been discov by hi friend now first becam
percept to elinor when it ceas to be notic
by them their attent and wit were drawn off to hi
more fortun rival; and the railleri which the other
had incur befor ani partial aros wa remov
when hi feel began realli to call for the ridicul
so justli annex to sensibl elinor wa oblig
though unwillingli to believ that the sentiment which
mr jen had assign him for her own satisfact
were now actual excit by her sister; and that howev
a gener resembl of disposit between the parti
might forward the affect of mr willoughbi an equal
strike opposit of charact wa no hindranc to the
regard of colonel brandon she saw it with concern;
for what could a silent man of five and thirti hope
when oppos to a veri live one of five and twenty? and as
she could not even wish him success she heartili wish
him indiffer she like him--in spite of hi graviti
and reserv she beheld in him an object of interest
hi manner though seriou were mild; and hi reserv
appear rather the result of some oppress of spirit
than of ani natur gloomi of temper sir john
had drop hint of past injuri and disappoint
which justifi her belief of hi be an unfortun man
and she regard him with respect and compass

perhap she piti and esteem him the more
becaus he wa slight by willoughbi and mariann
who prejud against him for be neither live
nor young seem resolv to undervalu hi merit

brandon is just the kind of man said willoughbi
one day when they were talk of him togeth
whom everi bodi speak well of and nobodi care about;
whom all are delight to see and nobodi rememb
to talk to

that is exactli what i think of him cri mariann

do not boast of it howev said elinor for it
is injustic in both of you he is highli esteem
by all the famili at the park and i never see him myself
without take pain to convers with him

that he is patronis by you repli willoughbi
is certainli in hi favour; but as for the esteem
of the other it is a reproach in itself who would
submit to the indign of be approv by such a woman
as ladi middleton and mr jen that could command
the indiffer of ani bodi else?

but perhap the abus of such peopl as yourself
and mariann will make amend for the regard of ladi
middleton and her mother if their prais is censur
your censur may be prais for they are not more undiscern
than you are prejud and unjust

in defenc of your proteg you can even be sauci

my proteg as you call him is a sensibl man;
and sens will alway have attract for me
ye mariann even in a man between thirti and forti
he ha seen a great deal of the world; ha been abroad
ha read and ha a think mind i have found him
capabl of give me much inform on variou subjects;
and he ha alway answer my inquiri with readi of
good-breed and good natur

that is to say cri mariann contemptu
he ha told you that in the east indi the climat is hot
and the mosquito are troublesom

he would have told me so i doubt not had i made
ani such inquiri but they happen to be point
on which i had been previous inform

perhap said willoughbi hi observ may
have extend to the exist of nabob gold mohr
and palanquin

i may ventur to say that hi observ
have stretch much further than your candour
but whi should you dislik him?

i do not dislik him i consid him on the contrari
as a veri respect man who ha everi bodi good word
and nobodi notice; who ha more money than he can spend
more time than he know how to employ and two new coat
everi year

add to which cri mariann that he ha
neither geniu tast nor spirit that hi understand
ha no brillianc hi feel no ardour and hi voic
no express

you decid on hi imperfect so much in the mass
repli elinor and so much on the strength of your
own imagin that the commend i am abl to give
of him is compar cold and insipid i can onli
pronounc him to be a sensibl man well-br well-inform
of gentl address and i believ possess an amiabl heart

miss dashwood cri willoughbi you are now use
me unkindli you are endeavour to disarm me by reason
and to convinc me against my will but it will not do
you shall find me as stubborn as you can be art i have
three unanswer reason for dislik colonel brandon;
he threaten me with rain when i want it to be fine;
he ha found fault with the hang of my curricl
and i cannot persuad him to buy my brown mare if it
will be ani satisfact to you howev to be told
that i believ hi charact to be in other respect
irreproach i am readi to confess it and in return
for an acknowledg which must give me some pain
you cannot deni me the privileg of dislik him as much
as ever



chapter 11


littl had mr dashwood or her daughter imagin
when they first came into devonshir that so mani
engag would aris to occupi their time as shortli
present themselv or that they should have such frequent
invit and such constant visitor as to leav them littl
leisur for seriou employ yet such wa the case
when mariann wa recov the scheme of amus at home
and abroad which sir john had been previous form
were put into execut the privat ball at the park
then began; and parti on the water were made and
accomplish as often as a showeri octob would allow
in everi meet of the kind willoughbi wa included;
and the eas and familiar which natur attend
these parti were exactli calcul to give increas
intimaci to hi acquaint with the dashwood to afford
him opportun of wit the excel of mariann
of mark hi anim admir of her and of receiv
in her behaviour to himself the most point assur
of her affect

elinor could not be surpris at their attach
she onli wish that it were less openli shewn; and onc
or twice did ventur to suggest the proprieti of some
self-command to mariann but mariann abhor all
conceal where no real disgrac could attend unreserve;
and to aim at the restraint of sentiment which were not
in themselv illaud appear to her not mere
an unnecessari effort but a disgrac subject
of reason to common-plac and mistaken notion
willoughbi thought the same; and their behaviour at
all time wa an illustr of their opinion

when he wa present she had no eye for ani one els
everi thing he did wa right everi thing he said wa clever
if their even at the park were conclud with card
he cheat himself and all the rest of the parti to get
her a good hand if danc form the amus
of the night they were partner for half the time;
and when oblig to separ for a coupl of danc
were care to stand togeth and scarc spoke a word
to ani bodi els such conduct made them of cours
most exceedingli laugh at; but ridicul could not shame
and seem hardli to provok them

mr dashwood enter into all their feel with
a warmth which left her no inclin for check thi
excess display of them to her it wa but the natur
consequ of a strong affect in a young and ardent mind

thi wa the season of happi to mariann
her heart wa devot to willoughbi and the fond attach
to norland which she brought with her from sussex
wa more like to be soften than she had thought it
possibl befor by the charm which hi societi bestow
on her present home

elinor happi wa not so great her heart wa not
so much at eas nor her satisfact in their amus
so pure they afford her no companion that could make
amend for what she had left behind nor that could teach
her to think of norland with less regret than ever
neither ladi middleton nor mr jen could suppli
to her the convers she missed; although the latter
wa an everlast talker and from the first had regard
her with a kind which ensur her a larg share of
her discours she had alreadi repeat her own histori
to elinor three or four times; and had elinor memori been
equal to her mean of improv she might have known
veri earli in their acquaint all the particular of
mr jen last ill and what he said to hi wife
a few minut befor he die ladi middleton wa more
agreeabl than her mother onli in be more silent
elinor need littl observ to perceiv that her
reserv wa a mere calm of manner with which sens
had noth to do toward her husband and mother she
wa the same as to them; and intimaci wa therefor
neither to be look for nor desir she had noth
to say one day that she had not said the day befor
her insipid wa invari for even her spirit were
alway the same; and though she did not oppos the parti
arrang by her husband provid everi thing were conduct
in style and her two eldest children attend her
she never appear to receiv more enjoy from them
than she might have experienc in sit at home;--
and so littl did her presenc add to the pleasur
of the other by ani share in their convers
that they were sometim onli remind of her be
amongst them by her solicitud about her troublesom boy

in colonel brandon alon of all her new acquaint
did elinor find a person who could in ani degre claim the
respect of abil excit the interest of friendship
or give pleasur as a companion willoughbi wa out
of the question her admir and regard even her
sisterli regard wa all hi own; but he wa a lover;
hi attent were wholli mariann and a far less
agreeabl man might have been more gener pleas
colonel brandon unfortun for himself had no such
encourag to think onli of mariann and in convers
with elinor he found the greatest consol for the
indiffer of her sister

elinor compass for him increas as she had reason
to suspect that the miseri of disappoint love had alreadi
been known to him thi suspicion wa given by some word
which accid drop from him one even at the park
when they were sit down togeth by mutual consent
while the other were danc hi eye were fix
on mariann and after a silenc of some minut
he said with a faint smile your sister i understand
doe not approv of second attach

no repli elinor her opinion are all romant

or rather as i believ she consid them
imposs to exist

i believ she doe but how she contriv it
without reflect on the charact of her own father
who had himself two wive i know not a few year
howev will settl her opinion on the reason basi
of common sens and observation; and then they may be
more easi to defin and to justifi than they now are
by ani bodi but herself

thi will probabl be the case he replied;
and yet there is someth so amiabl in the prejudic
of a young mind that one is sorri to see them give way
to the recept of more gener opinion

i cannot agre with you there said elinor
there are inconveni attend such feel
as mariann which all the charm of enthusiasm and
ignor of the world cannot aton for her system have
all the unfortun tendenc of set proprieti at nought;
and a better acquaint with the world is what i look
forward to as her greatest possibl advantag

after a short paus he resum the convers
by saying--

doe your sister make no distinct in her object
against a second attachment? or is it equal crimin
in everi body? are those who have been disappoint
in their first choic whether from the inconst
of it object or the pervers of circumst
to be equal indiffer dure the rest of their lives?

upon my word i am not acquaint with the minutia
of her principl i onli know that i never yet heard her
admit ani instanc of a second attach be pardon

thi said he cannot hold; but a chang
a total chang of sentiments--no no do not desir it;
for when the romant refin of a young mind
are oblig to give way how frequent are they
succeed by such opinion as are but too common and too
dangerous! i speak from experi i onc knew a ladi
who in temper and mind greatli resembl your sister
who thought and judg like her but who from an inforc
change--from a seri of unfortun circumstances--
here he stopt suddenly; appear to think that he had said
too much and by hi counten gave rise to conjectur
which might not otherwis have enter elinor head
the ladi would probabl have pass without suspicion
had he not convinc miss dashwood that what concern
her ought not to escap hi lip as it wa
it requir but a slight effort of fanci to connect hi
emot with the tender recollect of past regard
elinor attempt no more but mariann in her place
would not have done so littl the whole stori would
have been speedili form under her activ imagination;
and everi thing establish in the most melancholi order
of disastr love



chapter 12


as elinor and mariann were walk togeth the
next morn the latter commun a piec of news
to her sister which in spite of all that she knew
befor of mariann imprud and want of thought
surpris her by it extravag testimoni of both
mariann told her with the greatest delight that
willoughbi had given her a hors one that he had bred
himself on hi estat in somersetshir and which wa
exactli calcul to carri a woman without consid
that it wa not in her mother plan to keep ani hors
that if she were to alter her resolut in favour of
thi gift she must buy anoth for the servant and
keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stabl
to receiv them she had accept the present without
hesit and told her sister of it in raptur

he intend to send hi groom into somersetshir
immedi for it she ad and when it arriv we
will ride everi day you shall share it use with me
imagin to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop
on some of these down

most unwil wa she to awaken from such a dream of
felic to comprehend all the unhappi truth which attend
the affair; and for some time she refus to submit to them
as to an addit servant the expens would be a trifle;
mamma she wa sure would never object to it; and ani hors
would do for him; he might alway get one at the park;
as to a stabl the merest shed would be suffici
elinor then ventur to doubt the proprieti of her receiv
such a present from a man so littl or at least so late
known to her thi wa too much

you are mistaken elinor said she warmli
in suppos i know veri littl of willoughbi
i have not known him long inde but i am much better
acquaint with him than i am with ani other creatur
in the world except yourself and mama it is not
time or opportun that is to determin intimacy;--
it is disposit alon seven year would be insuffici
to make some peopl acquaint with each other and seven
day are more than enough for other i should hold
myself guilti of greater improprieti in accept a hors
from my brother than from willoughbi of john i know
veri littl though we have live togeth for years;
but of willoughbi my judgment ha long been form

elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more
she knew her sister temper opposit on so tender a
subject would onli attach her the more to her own opinion
but by an appeal to her affect for her mother
by repres the inconveni which that indulg
mother must draw on herself if (a would probabl be
the case) she consent to thi increas of establish
mariann wa shortli subdued; and she promis not to
tempt her mother to such imprud kind by mention
the offer and to tell willoughbi when she saw him next
that it must be declin

she wa faith to her word; and when willoughbi
call at the cottag the same day elinor heard her
express her disappoint to him in a low voic on
be oblig to forego the accept of hi present
the reason for thi alter were at the same time relat
and they were such as to make further entreati on hi
side imposs hi concern howev wa veri apparent;
and after express it with earnest he ad
in the same low voice--but mariann the hors is
still your though you cannot use it now i shall keep
it onli till you can claim it when you leav barton
to form your own establish in a more last home
queen mab shall receiv you

thi wa all overheard by miss dashwood; and in the
whole of the sentenc in hi manner of pronounc it
and in hi address her sister by her christian name alon
she instantli saw an intimaci so decid a mean
so direct as mark a perfect agreement between them
from that moment she doubt not of their be engag
to each other; and the belief of it creat no other surpris
than that she or ani of their friend should be left
by temper so frank to discov it by accid

margaret relat someth to her the next day
which place thi matter in a still clearer light
willoughbi had spent the preced even with them
and margaret by be left some time in the parlour
with onli him and mariann had had opportun
for observ which with a most import face
she commun to her eldest sister when they were
next by themselv

oh elinor! she cri i have such a secret to
tell you about mariann i am sure she will be marri
to mr willoughbi veri soon

you have said so repli elinor almost everi
day sinc they first met on high-church down; and they
had not known each other a week i believ befor you
were certain that mariann wore hi pictur round her neck;
but it turn out to be onli the miniatur of our great uncl

but inde thi is quit anoth thing i am sure
they will be marri veri soon for he ha got a lock
of her hair

take care margaret it may be onli the hair
of some great uncl of hi

but inde elinor it is mariann i am almost
sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night
after tea when you and mama went out of the room
they were whisper and talk togeth as fast as
could be and he seem to be beg someth of her
and present he took up her scissor and cut off a long
lock of her hair for it wa all tumbl down her back;
and he kiss it and fold it up in a piec of white paper;
and put it into hi pocket-book

for such particular state on such author
elinor could not withhold her credit; nor wa she dispos
to it for the circumst wa in perfect unison with
what she had heard and seen herself

margaret sagac wa not alway display in a
way so satisfactori to her sister when mr jen
attack her one even at the park to give the name
of the young man who wa elinor particular favourit
which had been long a matter of great curios to her
margaret answer by look at her sister and say
i must not tell may i elinor?

thi of cours made everi bodi laugh; and elinor
tri to laugh too but the effort wa pain
she wa convinc that margaret had fix on a person
whose name she could not bear with composur to becom
a stand joke with mr jen

mariann felt for her most sincerely; but she did
more harm than good to the caus by turn veri red
and say in an angri manner to margaret

rememb that whatev your conjectur may be
you have no right to repeat them

i never had ani conjectur about it repli margaret;
it wa you who told me of it yourself

thi increas the mirth of the compani and margaret
wa eagerli press to say someth more

oh! pray miss margaret let us know all about it
said mr jen what is the gentleman name?

i must not tell maam but i know veri well what it is;
and i know where he is too

ye ye we can guess where he is; at hi own hous
at norland to be sure he is the curat of the parish
i dare say

no that he is not he is of no profess at all

margaret said mariann with great warmth
you know that all thi is an invent of your own
and that there is no such person in exist

well then he is late dead mariann for i
am sure there wa such a man onc and hi name begin
with an f

most grate did elinor feel to ladi middleton
for observ at thi moment that it rain veri hard
though she believ the interrupt to proceed less from
ani attent to her than from her ladyship great dislik
of all such ineleg subject of railleri as delight
her husband and mother the idea howev start by her
wa immedi pursu by colonel brandon who wa
on everi occas mind of the feel of others;
and much wa said on the subject of rain by both of them
willoughbi open the piano-fort and ask mariann
to sit down to it; and thu amidst the variou endeavour
of differ peopl to quit the topic it fell to the ground
but not so easili did elinor recov from the alarm into
which it had thrown her

a parti wa form thi even for go on the
follow day to see a veri fine place about twelv mile
from barton belong to a brother-in-law of colonel brandon
without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor
who wa then abroad had left strict order on that head
the ground were declar to be highli beauti
and sir john who wa particularli warm in their prais
might be allow to be a toler judg for he had
form parti to visit them at least twice everi summer
for the last ten year they contain a nobl piec
of water; a sail on which wa to a form a great part of
the morn amusement; cold provis were to be taken
open carriag onli to be employ and everi thing
conduct in the usual style of a complet parti of pleasur

to some few of the compani it appear rather
a bold undertak consid the time of year
and that it had rain everi day for the last fortnight;--
and mr dashwood who had alreadi a cold wa persuad
by elinor to stay at home



chapter 13


their intend excurs to whitwel turn out
veri differ from what elinor had expect she wa
prepar to be wet through fatigu and frightened;
but the event wa still more unfortun for they did
not go at all

by ten oclock the whole parti wa assembl at
the park where they were to breakfast the morn
wa rather favour though it had rain all night
as the cloud were then dispers across the sky
and the sun frequent appear they were all in high
spirit and good humour eager to be happi and determin
to submit to the greatest inconveni and hardship
rather than be otherwis

while they were at breakfast the letter were brought in
among the rest there wa one for colonel brandon;--h
took it look at the direct chang colour
and immedi left the room

what is the matter with brandon? said sir john

nobodi could tell

i hope he ha had no bad news said ladi middleton
it must be someth extraordinari that could make colonel
brandon leav my breakfast tabl so suddenli

in about five minut he return

no bad news colonel i hope; said mr jen
as soon as he enter the room

none at all maam i thank you

wa it from avignon? i hope it is not to say
that your sister is wors

no maam it came from town and is mere
a letter of busi

but how came the hand to discompos you so much
if it wa onli a letter of business? come come
thi wont do colonel; so let us hear the truth of it

my dear madam said ladi middleton recollect what
you are say

perhap it is to tell you that your cousin fanni
is married? said mr jen without attend
to her daughter reproof

no inde it is not

well then i know who it is from colonel and i
hope she is well

whom do you mean maam? said he colour a littl

oh! you know who i mean

i am particularli sorri maam said he
address ladi middleton that i should receiv thi
letter today for it is on busi which requir
my immedi attend in town

in town! cri mr jen what can you
have to do in town at thi time of year?

my own loss is great be continu in be oblig
to leav so agreeabl a party; but i am the more concern
as i fear my presenc is necessari to gain your admitt
at whitwel

what a blow upon them all wa this!

but if you write a note to the housekeep mr brandon
said mariann eagerli will it not be sufficient?

he shook hi head

we must go said sir john--it shall not be put
off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till
tomorrow brandon that is all

i wish it could be so easili settl but it
is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!

if you would but let us know what your busi is
said mr jen we might see whether it could be put
off or not

you would not be six hour later said willoughbi
if you were to defer your journey till our return

i cannot afford to lose one hour--

elinor then heard willoughbi say in a low voic to mariann
there are some peopl who cannot bear a parti of pleasur
brandon is one of them he wa afraid of catch cold
i dare say and invent thi trick for get out of it
i would lay fifti guinea the letter wa of hi own write

i have no doubt of it repli mariann

there is no persuad you to chang your mind
brandon i know of old said sir john when onc you
are determin on anyth but howev i hope you
will think better of it consid here are the two miss
carey come over from newton the three miss dashwood
walk up from the cottag and mr willoughbi got up
two hour befor hi usual time on purpos to go to whitwel

colonel brandon again repeat hi sorrow at be
the caus of disappoint the party; but at the same
time declar it to be unavoid

well then when will you come back again?

i hope we shall see you at barton ad her ladyship
as soon as you can conveni leav town; and we must
put off the parti to whitwel till you return

you are veri oblig but it is so uncertain
when i may have it in my power to return that i dare
not engag for it at all

oh! he must and shall come back cri sir john
if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go
after him

ay so do sir john cri mr jen and then
perhap you may find out what hi busi is

i do not want to pri into other men concern
i suppos it is someth he is asham of

colonel brandon hors were announc

you do not go to town on horseback do you?
ad sir john

no onli to honiton i shall then go post

well as you are resolv to go i wish you
a good journey but you had better chang your mind

i assur you it is not in my power

he then took leav of the whole parti

is there no chanc of my see you and your sister
in town thi winter miss dashwood?

i am afraid none at all

then i must bid you farewel for a longer time
than i should wish to do

to mariann he mere bow and said noth

come colonel said mr jen befor you go
do let us know what you are go about

he wish her a good morn and attend by sir john
left the room

the complaint and lament which polit
had hitherto restrain now burst forth universally;
and they all agre again and again how provok it wa
to be so disappoint

i can guess what hi busi is howev
said mr jen exultingli

can you maam? said almost everi bodi

yes; it is about miss william i am sure

and who is miss williams? ask mariann

what! do not you know who miss william is? i am
sure you must have heard of her befor she is a relat
of the colonel my dear; a veri near relat we will
not say how near for fear of shock the young ladi
then lower her voic a littl she said to elinor
she is hi natur daughter

indeed!

oh yes; and as like him as she can stare
i dare say the colonel will leav her all hi fortun

when sir john return he join most heartili
in the gener regret on so unfortun an event;
conclud howev by observ that as they were
all got togeth they must do someth by way of
be happy; and after some consult it wa agre
that although happi could onli be enjoy at whitwel
they might procur a toler composur of mind by drive
about the countri the carriag were then ordered;
willoughbi wa first and mariann never look
happier than when she got into it he drove through
the park veri fast and they were soon out of sight;
and noth more of them wa seen till their return
which did not happen till after the return of all the rest
they both seem delight with their drive; but said
onli in gener term that they had kept in the lane
while the other went on the down

it wa settl that there should be a danc in the even
and that everi bodi should be extrem merri all day long
some more of the carey came to dinner and they had the
pleasur of sit down nearli twenti to tabl which sir
john observ with great content willoughbi took
hi usual place between the two elder miss dashwood
mr jen sat on elinor right hand; and they had not
been long seat befor she leant behind her and willoughbi
and said to mariann loud enough for them both to hear
i have found you out in spite of all your trick
i know where you spent the morn

mariann colour and repli veri hastili
where pray?--

did not you know said willoughbi that we had
been out in my curricle?

ye ye mr impud i know that veri well
and i wa determin to find out where you had been to--
i hope you like your hous miss mariann it is a veri
larg one i know; and when i come to see you i hope you
will have new-furnish it for it want it veri much
when i wa there six year ago

mariann turn away in great confus
mr jen laugh heartily; and elinor found that in her
resolut to know where they had been she had actual
made her own woman enquir of mr willoughbi groom;
and that she had by that method been inform that they
had gone to allenham and spent a consider time there
in walk about the garden and go all over the hous

elinor could hardli believ thi to be true
as it seem veri unlik that willoughbi should propos
or mariann consent to enter the hous while mr smith wa
in it with whom mariann had not the smallest acquaint

as soon as they left the dining-room elinor enquir
of her about it; and great wa her surpris when she
found that everi circumst relat by mr jen
wa perfectli true mariann wa quit angri with her
for doubt it

whi should you imagin elinor that we did not
go there or that we did not see the house? is not it
what you have often wish to do yourself?

ye mariann but i would not go while mr smith
wa there and with no other companion than mr willoughbi

mr willoughbi howev is the onli person who can
have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open
carriag it wa imposs to have ani other companion
i never spent a pleasant morn in my life

i am afraid repli elinor that the pleasant
of an employ doe not alway evinc it proprieti

on the contrari noth can be a stronger proof
of it elinor; for if there had been ani real improprieti
in what i did i should have been sensibl of it at
the time for we alway know when we are act wrong
and with such a convict i could have had no pleasur

but my dear mariann as it ha alreadi expos you
to some veri impertin remark do you not now begin
to doubt the discret of your own conduct?

if the impertin remark of mr jen are
to be the proof of improprieti in conduct we are all
offend everi moment of our live i valu not her
censur ani more than i should do her commend
i am not sensibl of have done anyth wrong in walk
over mr smith ground or in see her hous
they will one day be mr willoughbi and--

if they were one day to be your own mariann
you would not be justifi in what you have done

she blush at thi hint; but it wa even visibl
gratifi to her; and after a ten minut interv of
earnest thought she came to her sister again and said
with great good humour perhap elinor it wa rather
ill-judg in me to go to allenham; but mr willoughbi want
particularli to shew me the place; and it is a charm hous
i assur you--ther is one remark pretti sit room
up stairs; of a nice comfort size for constant use
and with modern furnitur it would be delight
it is a corner room and ha window on two side
on one side you look across the bowling-green behind
the hous to a beauti hang wood and on the other you
have a view of the church and villag and beyond them
of those fine bold hill that we have so often admir
i did not see it to advantag for noth could be
more forlorn than the furniture--but if it were newli
fit up--a coupl of hundr pound willoughbi say
would make it one of the pleasantest summer-room
in england

could elinor have listen to her without interrupt
from the other she would have describ everi room
in the hous with equal delight



chapter 14


the sudden termin of colonel brandon visit
at the park with hi steadi in conceal it caus
fill the mind and rais the wonder of mr jen
for two or three days; she wa a great wonder as everi
one must be who take a veri live interest in all the
come and go of all their acquaint she wonder
with littl intermiss what could be the reason of it;
wa sure there must be some bad news and thought over
everi kind of distress that could have befallen him
with a fix determin that he should not escap
them all

someth veri melancholi must be the matter
i am sure said she i could see it in hi face
poor man! i am afraid hi circumst may be bad
the estat at delaford wa never reckon more than two thousand
a year and hi brother left everyth sadli involv
i do think he must have been sent for about money matter
for what els can it be? i wonder whether it is so
i would give anyth to know the truth of it perhap it
is about miss william and by the bye i dare say it is
becaus he look so consciou when i mention her
may be she is ill in town; noth in the world more like
for i have a notion she is alway rather sickli
i would lay ani wager it is about miss william
it is not so veri like he should be distress in
hi circumst now for he is a veri prudent man
and to be sure must have clear the estat by thi time
i wonder what it can be! may be hi sister is wors
at avignon and ha sent for him over hi set off
in such a hurri seem veri like it well i wish him out
of all hi troubl with all my heart and a good wife into
the bargain

so wonder so talk mr jen her opinion
vari with everi fresh conjectur and all seem
equal probabl as they aros elinor though she felt
realli interest in the welfar of colonel brandon
could not bestow all the wonder on hi go so suddenli
away which mr jen wa desir of her feeling;
for besid that the circumst did not in her opinion
justifi such last amaz or varieti of specul
her wonder wa otherwis dispos of it wa engross
by the extraordinari silenc of her sister and willoughbi
on the subject which they must know to be peculiarli
interest to them all as thi silenc continu
everi day made it appear more strang and more incompat
with the disposit of both whi they should not openli
acknowledg to her mother and herself what their constant
behaviour to each other declar to have taken place
elinor could not imagin

she could easili conceiv that marriag might not
be immedi in their power; for though willoughbi
wa independ there wa no reason to believ him rich
hi estat had been rate by sir john at about six or seven
hundr a year; but he live at an expens to which that incom
could hardli be equal and he had himself often complain
of hi poverti but for thi strang kind of secreci
maintain by them rel to their engag which
in fact conceal noth at all she could not account;
and it wa so wholli contradictori to their gener
opinion and practic that a doubt sometim enter
her mind of their be realli engag and thi doubt
wa enough to prevent her make ani inquiri of mariann

noth could be more express of attach
to them all than willoughbi behaviour to mariann
it had all the distinguish tender which a lover
heart could give and to the rest of the famili it wa the
affection attent of a son and a brother the cottag
seem to be consid and love by him as hi home;
mani more of hi hour were spent there than at allenham;
and if no gener engag collect them at the park
the exercis which call him out in the morn wa
almost certain of end there where the rest of the day
wa spent by himself at the side of mariann and by hi
favourit pointer at her feet

one even in particular about a week after
colonel brandon left the countri hi heart seem
more than usual open to everi feel of attach
to the object around him; and on mr dashwood
happen to mention her design of improv the cottag
in the spring he warmli oppos everi alter
of a place which affect had establish as perfect with him

what! he exclaimed--improv thi dear cottage!
no that i will never consent to not a stone must
be ad to it wall not an inch to it size
if my feel are regard

do not be alarm said miss dashwood
noth of the kind will be done; for my mother
will never have money enough to attempt it

i am heartili glad of it he cri may she
alway be poor if she can employ her rich no better

thank you willoughbi but you may be assur that i
would not sacrific one sentiment of local attach
of your or of ani one whom i love for all the improv
in the world depend upon it that whatev unemploy
sum may remain when i make up my account in the spring
i would even rather lay it uselessli by than dispos
of it in a manner so pain to you but are you realli
so attach to thi place as to see no defect in it?

i am said he to me it is faultless nay more
i consid it as the onli form of build in which happi
is attain and were i rich enough i would instantli pull
comb down and build it up again in the exact plan of thi
cottag

with dark narrow stair and a kitchen that smoke
i suppos said elinor

ye cri he in the same eager tone with all
and everi thing belong to it;--in no one conveni
or inconveni about it should the least variat
be percept then and then onli under such a roof i
might perhap be as happi at comb as i have been at barton

i flatter myself repli elinor that even under
the disadvantag of better room and a broader staircas
you will hereaft find your own hous as faultless as you
now do thi

there certainli are circumst said willoughbi
which might greatli endear it to me; but thi place will
alway have one claim of my affect which no other can
possibl share

mr dashwood look with pleasur at mariann
whose fine eye were fix so express on willoughbi
as plainli denot how well she understood him

how often did i wish ad he when i wa at
allenham thi time twelvemonth that barton cottag were
inhabited! i never pass within view of it without admir
it situat and griev that no one should live in it
how littl did i then think that the veri first news
i should hear from mr smith when i next came into
the countri would be that barton cottag wa taken: and i
felt an immedi satisfact and interest in the event
which noth but a kind of prescienc of what happi i
should experi from it can account for must it not have
been so marianne? speak to her in a lower voic
then continu hi former tone he said and yet thi
hous you would spoil mr dashwood? you would rob it
of it simplic by imaginari improvement! and thi dear
parlour in which our acquaint first began and in which
so mani happi hour have been sinc spent by us togeth
you would degrad to the condit of a common entranc
and everi bodi would be eager to pass through the room
which ha hitherto contain within itself more real
accommod and comfort than ani other apart of
the handsomest dimens in the world could possibl afford

mr dashwood again assur him that no alter
of the kind should be attempt

you are a good woman he warmli repli
your promis make me easi extend it a littl farther
and it will make me happi tell me that not onli your
hous will remain the same but that i shall ever find
you and your as unchang as your dwelling; and that you
will alway consid me with the kind which ha made
everyth belong to you so dear to me

the promis wa readili given and willoughbi
behaviour dure the whole of the even declar
at onc hi affect and happi

shall we see you tomorrow to dinner? said mr dashwood
when he wa leav them i do not ask you to come in
the morn for we must walk to the park to call on ladi
middleton

he engag to be with them by four oclock



chapter 15


mr dashwood visit to ladi middleton took place
the next day and two of her daughter went with her;
but mariann excus herself from be of the parti
under some trifl pretext of employment; and her mother
who conclud that a promis had been made by willoughbi
the night befor of call on her while they were absent
wa perfectli satisfi with her remain at home

on their return from the park they found willoughbi
curricl and servant in wait at the cottag
and mr dashwood wa convinc that her conjectur
had been just so far it wa all as she had foreseen;
but on enter the hous she beheld what no foresight
had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the
passag than mariann came hastili out of the parlour
appar in violent afflict with her handkerchief
at her eyes; and without notic them ran up stair
surpris and alarm they proceed directli into the room
she had just quit where they found onli willoughbi
who wa lean against the mantel-piec with hi back
toward them he turn round on their come in
and hi counten shew that he strongli partook
of the emot which over-pow mariann

is anyth the matter with her? cri mr dashwood
as she entered--i she ill?

i hope not he repli tri to look cheerful;
and with a forc smile present ad it is i who may
rather expect to be ill--for i am now suffer under a
veri heavi disappointment!

disappointment?

ye for i am unabl to keep my engag with you
mr smith ha thi morn exercis the privileg
of rich upon a poor depend cousin by send me on
busi to london i have just receiv my dispatch
and taken my farewel of allenham; and by way of exhilar
i am now come to take my farewel of you

to london!--and are you go thi morning?

almost thi moment

thi is veri unfortun but mr smith must
be obliged;--and her busi will not detain you from
us long i hope

he colour as he repli you are veri kind but i
have no idea of return into devonshir immedi
my visit to mr smith are never repeat within
the twelvemonth

and is mr smith your onli friend? is allenham the onli
hous in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?
for shame willoughbi can you wait for an invit here?

hi colour increased; and with hi eye fix
on the ground he onli repli you are too good

mr dashwood look at elinor with surpris
elinor felt equal amaz for a few moment everi one
wa silent mr dashwood first spoke

i have onli to add my dear willoughbi that at
barton cottag you will alway be welcome; for i will not
press you to return here immedi becaus you onli
can judg how far that might be pleas to mr smith;
and on thi head i shall be no more dispos to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclin

my engag at present repli willoughbi
confusedli are of such a nature--that--i dare not flatter
myself--

he stopt mr dashwood wa too much astonish
to speak and anoth paus succeed thi wa broken
by willoughbi who said with a faint smile it is folli
to linger in thi manner i will not torment myself
ani longer by remain among friend whose societi
it is imposs for me now to enjoy

he then hastili took leav of them all and left
the room they saw him step into hi carriag
and in a minut it wa out of sight

mr dashwood felt too much for speech and instantli
quit the parlour to give way in solitud to the concern
and alarm which thi sudden departur occas

elinor uneasi wa at least equal to her mother
she thought of what had just pass with anxieti and distrust
willoughbi behaviour in take leav of them hi
embarrass
and affect of cheer and abov all hi
unwilling
to accept her mother invit a backward so unlik a
lover
so unlik himself greatli disturb her one moment she fear
that no seriou design had ever been form on hi side; and the
next that some unfortun quarrel had taken place between him
and
her sister;--th distress in which mariann had quit the room
wa such as a seriou quarrel could most reason account for
though when she consid what mariann love for him wa
a quarrel seem almost imposs

but whatev might be the particular of their separ
her sister afflict wa indubitable; and she thought
with the tenderest compass of that violent sorrow
which mariann wa in all probabl not mere give
way to as a relief but feed and encourag as a duti

in about half an hour her mother return and though
her eye were red her counten wa not uncheer

our dear willoughbi is now some mile from barton elinor
said she as she sat down to work and with how heavi a heart
doe he travel?

it is all veri strang so suddenli to be gone! it
seem but the work of a moment and last night he wa
with us so happi so cheer so affectionate? and now
after onli ten minut notice--gon too without intend
to return!--someth more than what be own to us must
have happen he did not speak he did not behav
like himself you must have seen the differ as well as i
what can it be? can they have quarrelled? whi els should he
have shewn such unwilling to accept your invit here?--

it wa not inclin that he want elinor; i could
plainli see that he had not the power of accept it
i have thought it all over i assur you and i can
perfectli account for everi thing that at first seem
strang to me as well as to you

can you indeed!

ye i have explain it to myself in the most
satisfactori way;--but you elinor who love to doubt
where you can--it will not satisfi you i know; but you
shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuad
that mr smith suspect hi regard for mariann
disapprov of it (perhap becaus she ha other view
for him) and on that account is eager to get him away;--
and that the busi which she send him off to transact
is invent as an excus to dismiss him thi is what i
believ to have happen he is moreov awar that she
doe disapprov the connect he dare not therefor
at present confess to her hi engag with mariann
and he feel himself oblig from hi depend situat
to give into her scheme and absent himself from
devonshir for a while you will tell me i know
that thi may or may not have happened; but i will listen
to no cavil unless you can point out ani other method
of understand the affair as satisfactori at thi
and now elinor what have you to say?

noth for you have anticip my answer

then you would have told me that it might or might not
have happen oh elinor how incomprehens are your
feelings! you had rather take evil upon credit than good
you had rather look out for miseri for mariann and guilt
for poor willoughbi than an apolog for the latter
you are resolv to think him blameabl becaus he took
leav of us with less affect than hi usual behaviour
ha shewn and is no allow to be made for inadvert
or for spirit depress by recent disappointment? are
no probabl to be accept mere becaus they
are not certainties? is noth due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love and no reason in the world
to think ill of? to the possibl of motiv unanswer
in themselv though unavoid secret for a while? and
after all what is it you suspect him of?

i can hardli tell myself but suspicion of
someth unpleas is the inevit consequ
of such an alter as we just wit in him
there is great truth howev in what you have now urg
of the allow which ought to be made for him and it
is my wish to be candid in my judgment of everi bodi
willoughbi may undoubtedli have veri suffici
reason for hi conduct and i will hope that he ha
but it would have been more like willoughbi to acknowledg
them at onc secreci may be advisable; but still i
cannot help wonder at it be practic by him

do not blame him howev for depart from
hi charact where the deviat is necessari
but you realli do admit the justic of what i have said
in hi defence?--i am happy--and he is acquit

not entir it may be proper to conceal their
engag (if they are engaged) from mr smith--
and if that is the case it must be highli expedi
for willoughbi to be but littl in devonshir at present
but thi is no excus for their conceal it from us

conceal it from us! my dear child do you accus
willoughbi and mariann of concealment? thi is strang
inde when your eye have been reproach them everi day
for incauti

i want no proof of their affect said elinor;
but of their engag i do

i am perfectli satisfi of both

yet not a syllabl ha been said to you on the
subject by either of them

i have not want syllabl where action have
spoken so plainli ha not hi behaviour to mariann
and to all of us for at least the last fortnight
declar that he love and consid her as hi futur wife
and that he felt for us the attach of the nearest
relation? have we not perfectli understood each other?
ha not my consent been daili ask by hi look hi manner
hi attent and affection respect? my elinor
is it possibl to doubt their engagement? how could
such a thought occur to you? how is it to be suppos
that willoughbi persuad as he must be of your
sister love should leav her and leav her perhap
for month without tell her of hi affection;--that
they should part without a mutual exchang of confidence?

i confess repli elinor that everi circumst
except one is in favour of their engagement;
but that one is the total silenc of both on the subject
and with me it almost outweigh everi other

how strang thi is! you must think wretchedli inde
of willoughbi if after all that ha openli pass between them
you can doubt the natur of the term on which they are togeth
ha he been act a part in hi behaviour to your sister
all thi time? do you suppos him realli indiffer to her?

no i cannot think that he must and doe love her
i am sure

but with a strang kind of tender if he can
leav her with such indiffer such careless
of the futur as you attribut to him

you must rememb my dear mother that i have never
consid thi matter as certain i have had my doubt
i confess; but they are fainter than they were and they
may soon be entir done away if we find they correspond
everi fear of mine will be remov

a mighti concess indeed! if you were to see
them at the altar you would suppos they were go to
be marri ungraci girl! but i requir no such proof
noth in my opinion ha ever pass to justifi doubt;
no secreci ha been attempted; all ha been uniformli open
and unreserv you cannot doubt your sister wish
it must be willoughbi therefor whom you suspect but why?
is he not a man of honour and feeling? ha there been ani
inconsist on hi side to creat alarm? can he be deceitful?

i hope not i believ not cri elinor
i love willoughbi sincer love him; and suspicion of hi
integr cannot be more pain to yourself than to me
it ha been involuntari and i will not encourag it
i wa startl i confess by the alter in hi
manner thi morning;--h did not speak like himself
and did not return your kind with ani cordial
but all thi may be explain by such a situat of hi
affair as you have suppos he had just part from
my sister had seen her leav him in the greatest affliction;
and if he felt oblig from a fear of offend mr smith
to resist the temptat of return here soon and yet
awar that by declin your invit by say
that he wa go away for some time he should seem
to act an ungener a suspici part by our famili
be might well be embarrass and disturb in such a case
a plain and open avow of hi difficulti would have been
more to hi honour i think as well as more consist
with hi gener character;--but i will not rais object
against ani one conduct on so illiber a foundat
as a differ in judgment from myself or a deviat from
what i may think right and consist

you speak veri properli willoughbi certainli doe
not deserv to be suspect though we have not known
him long he is no stranger in thi part of the world;
and who ha ever spoken to hi disadvantage? had he been
in a situat to act independ and marri immedi
it might have been odd that he should leav us without
acknowledg everyth to me at once: but thi is not the case
it is an engag in some respect not prosper begun
for their marriag must be at a veri uncertain distance;
and even secreci as far as it can be observ may now
be veri advis

they were interrupt by the entranc of margaret;
and elinor wa then at liberti to think over the represent
of her mother to acknowledg the probabl of mani
and hope for the justic of all

they saw noth of mariann till dinner time
when she enter the room and took her place at the tabl
without say a word her eye were red and swollen;
and it seem as if her tear were even then restrain
with difficulti she avoid the look of them all
could neither eat nor speak and after some time on her
mother silent press her hand with tender compass
her small degre of fortitud wa quit overcom she burst
into tear and left the room

thi violent oppress of spirit continu the
whole even she wa without ani power becaus she
wa without ani desir of command over herself
the slightest mention of anyth rel to willoughbi
overpow her in an instant; and though her famili
were most anxious attent to her comfort it wa
imposs for them if they spoke at all to keep clear
of everi subject which her feel connect with him



chapter 16


mariann would have thought herself veri inexcus
had she been abl to sleep at all the first night
after part from willoughbi she would have been
asham to look her famili in the face the next morn
had she not risen from her bed in more need of repos
than when she lay down in it but the feel which
made such composur a disgrac left her in no danger
of incur it she wa awak the whole night and she
wept the greatest part of it she got up with a headach
wa unabl to talk and unwil to take ani nourishment;
give pain everi moment to her mother and sister
and forbid all attempt at consol from either
her sensibl wa potent enough!

when breakfast wa over she walk out by herself
and wander about the villag of allenham indulg the
recollect of past enjoy and cri over the present
revers for the chief of the morn

the even pass off in the equal indulg of feel
she play over everi favourit song that she had been use
to play to willoughbi everi air in which their voic
had been oftenest join and sat at the instrument gaze
on everi line of music that he had written out for her
till her heart wa so heavi that no farther sad
could be gained; and thi nourish of grief wa everi
day appli she spent whole hour at the pianofort
altern sing and crying; her voic often total
suspend by her tear in book too as well as in music
she court the miseri which a contrast between the past
and present wa certain of give she read noth
but what they had been use to read togeth

such violenc of afflict inde could not be support
for ever; it sunk within a few day into a calmer melancholy;
but these employ to which she daili recur
her solitari walk and silent medit still produc
occasion effus of sorrow as live as ever

no letter from willoughbi came; and none seem expect
by mariann her mother wa surpris and elinor again
becam uneasi but mr dashwood could find explan
whenev she want them which at least satisfi herself

rememb elinor said she how veri often sir john
fetch our letter himself from the post and carri them
to it we have alreadi agre that secreci may be necessari
and we must acknowledg that it could not be maintain if
their correspond were to pass through sir john hand

elinor could not deni the truth of thi and she tri
to find in it a motiv suffici for their silenc
but there wa one method so direct so simpl and in
her opinion so elig of know the real state
of the affair and of instantli remov all mysteri
that she could not help suggest it to her mother

whi do you not ask mariann at onc said she
whether she is or she is not engag to willoughby? from you
her mother and so kind so indulg a mother the question
could not give offenc it would be the natur result
of your affect for her she use to be all unreserv
and to you more especi

i would not ask such a question for the world
suppos it possibl that they are not engag
what distress would not such an enquiri inflict! at ani
rate it would be most ungener i should never deserv
her confid again after forc from her a confess
of what is meant at present to be unacknowledg to ani one
i know mariann heart: i know that she dearli love me
and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made
known
when circumst make the reveal of it elig
i would not attempt to forc the confid of ani one;
of a child much less; becaus a sens of duti would prevent
the denial which her wish might direct

elinor thought thi generos overstrain
consid her sister youth and urg the matter farther
but in vain; common sens common care common prudenc
were all sunk in mr dashwood romant delicaci

it wa sever day befor willoughbi name
wa mention befor mariann by ani of her family;
sir john and mr jen inde were not so nice;
their wittic ad pain to mani a pain hour;--
but one even mr dashwood accident take up a
volum of shakespear exclaim

we have never finish hamlet marianne; our dear
willoughbi went away befor we could get through it
we will put it by that when he come againbut it may
be month perhap befor that happen

months! cri mariann with strong surpris
no--nor mani week

mr dashwood wa sorri for what she had said;
but it gave elinor pleasur as it produc a repli
from mariann so express of confid in willoughbi
and knowledg of hi intent

one morn about a week after hi leav the countri
mariann wa prevail on to join her sister in their
usual walk instead of wander away by herself
hitherto she had care avoid everi companion in
her rambl if her sister intend to walk on the down
she directli stole away toward the lanes; if they talk
of the valley she wa as speedi in climb the hill
and could never be found when the other set off
but at length she wa secur by the exert of elinor
who greatli disapprov such continu seclus they walk
along the road through the valley and chiefli in silenc
for mariann mind could not be control and elinor
satisfi with gain one point would not then attempt more
beyond the entranc of the valley where the countri
though still rich wa less wild and more open a long
stretch of the road which they had travel on first come
to barton lay befor them; and on reach that point
they stop to look around them and examin a prospect
which form the distanc of their view from the cottag
from a spot which they had never happen to reach in ani
of their walk befor

amongst the object in the scene they soon discov
an anim one; it wa a man on horseback ride toward them
in a few minut they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;
and in a moment afterward mariann raptur exclaim

it is he; it is indeed;--i know it is!--and wa
hasten to meet him when elinor cri out

inde mariann i think you are mistaken it is
not willoughbi the person is not tall enough for him
and ha not hi air

he ha he ha cri mariann i am sure he ha
hi air hi coat hi hors i knew how soon he would come

she walk eagerli on as she spoke; and elinor
to screen mariann from particular as she felt almost
certain of it not be willoughbi quicken her
pace and kept up with her they were soon within
thirti yard of the gentleman mariann look again;
her heart sunk within her; and abruptli turn round
she wa hurri back when the voic of both her sister
were rais to detain her; a third almost as well known
as willoughbi join them in beg her to stop
and she turn round with surpris to see and welcom
edward ferrar

he wa the onli person in the world who could
at that moment be forgiven for not be willoughby;
the onli one who could have gain a smile from her;
but she dispers her tear to smile on him and in her
sister happi forgot for a time her own disappoint

he dismount and give hi hors to hi servant
walk back with them to barton whither he wa purpos
come to visit them

he wa welcom by them all with great cordial
but especi by mariann who show more warmth of
regard in her recept of him than even elinor herself
to mariann inde the meet between edward and her sister
wa but a continu of that unaccount cold which she
had often observ at norland in their mutual behaviour
on edward side more particularli there wa a defici
of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occas
he wa confus seem scarc sensibl of pleasur
in see them look neither raptur nor gay
said littl but what wa forc from him by question
and distinguish elinor by no mark of affect
mariann saw and listen with increas surpris
she began almost to feel a dislik of edward; and it end
as everi feel must end with her by carri back her
thought to willoughbi whose manner form a contrast
suffici strike to those of hi brother elect

after a short silenc which succeed the first
surpris and enquiri of meet mariann ask
edward if he came directli from london no he had
been in devonshir a fortnight

a fortnight! she repeat surpris at hi be
so long in the same counti with elinor without see
her befor

he look rather distress as he ad that he
had been stay with some friend near plymouth

have you been late in sussex? said elinor

i wa at norland about a month ago

and how doe dear dear norland look? cri mariann

dear dear norland said elinor probabl look
much as it alway doe at thi time of the year
the wood and walk thickli cover with dead leav

oh cri mariann with what transport sensat
have i formerli seen them fall! how have i delight
as i walk to see them driven in shower about me
by the wind! what feel have they the season the air
altogeth inspired! now there is no one to regard them
they are seen onli as a nuisanc swept hastili off
and driven as much as possibl from the sight

it is not everi one said elinor who ha your
passion for dead leav

no; my feel are not often share not often
understood but sometim they are--a she said thi
she sunk into a reveri for a few moments;--but rous
herself again now edward said she call hi attent
to the prospect here is barton valley look up to it
and be tranquil if you can look at those hills!
did you ever see their equals? to the left is barton park
amongst those wood and plantat you may see the end
of the hous and there beneath that farthest hill
which rise with such grandeur is our cottag

it is a beauti countri he replied; but these
bottom must be dirti in winter

how can you think of dirt with such object befor you?

becaus repli he smile among the rest of the
object befor me i see a veri dirti lane

how strange! said mariann to herself as she walk on

have you an agreeabl neighbourhood here? are the
middleton pleasant people?

no not all answer marianne; we could not
be more unfortun situat

mariann cri her sister how can you say so? how can
you be so unjust? they are a veri respect famili mr
ferrars;
and toward us have behav in the friendliest manner have you
forgot mariann how mani pleasant day we have owe to them?

no said mariann in a low voic nor how mani
pain moment

elinor took no notic of this; and direct
her attent to their visitor endeavour to support
someth like discours with him by talk of their
present resid it conveni &c extort from him
occasion question and remark hi cold and reserv
mortifi her severely; she wa vex and half angry;
but resolv to regul her behaviour to him by the past
rather than the present she avoid everi appear
of resent or displeasur and treat him as she
thought he ought to be treat from the famili connect



chapter 17


mr dashwood wa surpris onli for a moment at
see him; for hi come to barton wa in her opinion
of all thing the most natur her joy and express
of regard long outliv her wonder he receiv the kindest
welcom from her; and shyness cold reserv could not
stand against such a recept they had begun to fail him
befor he enter the hous and they were quit overcom
by the captiv manner of mr dashwood inde a man
could not veri well be in love with either of her daughter
without extend the passion to her; and elinor had the
satisfact of see him soon becom more like himself
hi affect seem to reanim toward them all
and hi interest in their welfar again becam percept
he wa not in spirit however; he prais their hous
admir it prospect wa attent and kind; but still
he wa not in spirit the whole famili perceiv it
and mr dashwood attribut it to some want of liber
in hi mother sat down to tabl indign against all
selfish parent

what are mr ferrarss view for you at present edward?
said she when dinner wa over and they had drawn round
the fire; are you still to be a great orat in spite of
yourself?

no i hope my mother is now convinc that i have
no more talent than inclin for a public life!

but how is your fame to be established? for famou you
must be to satisfi all your family; and with no inclin
for expens no affect for stranger no profess
and no assur you may find it a difficult matter

i shall not attempt it i have no wish to be
distinguished; and have everi reason to hope i never shall
thank heaven! i cannot be forc into geniu and eloqu

you have no ambit i well know your wish
are all moder

as moder as those of the rest of the world
i believ i wish as well as everi bodi els to be
perfectli happy; but like everi bodi els it must be
in my own way great will not make me so

strang that it would! cri mariann what have
wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?

grandeur ha but littl said elinor but wealth
ha much to do with it

elinor for shame! said mariann money can onli
give happi where there is noth els to give it
beyond a compet it can afford no real satisfact
as far as mere self is concern

perhap said elinor smile we may come
to the same point your compet and my wealth
are veri much alik i dare say; and without them
as the world goe now we shall both agre that everi
kind of extern comfort must be want your idea
are onli more nobl than mine come what is your competence?

about eighteen hundr or two thousand a year;
not more than that

elinor laugh two thousand a year! one is my
wealth! i guess how it would end

and yet two thousand a-year is a veri moder incom
said mariann a famili cannot well be maintain on
a smaller i am sure i am not extravag in my demand
a proper establish of servant a carriag perhap two
and hunter cannot be support on less

elinor smile again to hear her sister describ
so accur their futur expens at comb magna

hunters! repeat edward--but whi must you have
hunters? everi bodi doe not hunt

mariann colour as she repli but most peopl do

i wish said margaret strike out a novel thought
that somebodi would give us all a larg fortun apiece!

oh that they would! cri mariann her eye
sparkl with anim and her cheek glow
with the delight of such imaginari happi

we are all unanim in that wish i suppos
said elinor in spite of the insuffici of wealth

oh dear! cri margaret how happi i should be!
i wonder what i should do with it!

mariann look as if she had no doubt on that point

i should be puzzl to spend so larg a fortun myself
said mr dashwood if my children were all to be rich
my help

you must begin your improv on thi hous
observ elinor and your difficulti will soon vanish

what magnific order would travel from thi famili
to london said edward in such an event! what a happi
day for booksel music-sel and print-shops! you
miss dashwood would give a gener commiss for everi
new print of merit to be sent you--and as for mariann
i know her great of soul there would not be music enough
in london to content her and books!--thomson cowper
scott--sh would buy them all over and over again: she
would buy up everi copi i believ to prevent their
fall into unworthi hands; and she would have everi
book that tell her how to admir an old twist tree
should not you marianne? forgiv me if i am veri sauci
but i wa will to shew you that i had not forgot our
old disput

i love to be remind of the past edward--wheth it
be melancholi or gay i love to recal it--and you
will never offend me by talk of former time
you are veri right in suppos how my money would be
spent--som of it at least--mi loos cash would certainli
be employ in improv my collect of music and book

and the bulk of your fortun would be laid out
in annuiti on the author or their heir

no edward i should have someth els to do
with it

perhap then you would bestow it as a reward on that
person who wrote the ablest defenc of your favourit maxim
that no one can ever be in love more than onc in their
life--your opinion on that point is unchang i presume?

undoubtedli at my time of life opinion are toler fix
it is not like that i should now see or hear ani thing to
chang them

mariann is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor
she is not at all alter

she is onli grown a littl more grave than she wa

nay edward said mariann you need not reproach me
you are not veri gay yourself

whi should you think so! repli he with a sigh
but gaieti never wa a part of my charact

nor do i think it a part of mariann said elinor;
i should hardli call her a live girl--sh is veri earnest
veri eager in all she does--sometim talk a great deal
and alway with animation--but she is not often realli merri

i believ you are right he repli and yet i
have alway set her down as a live girl

i have frequent detect myself in such kind of mistak
said elinor in a total misapprehens of charact in some
point or other: fanci peopl so much more gay or grave
or ingeni or stupid than they realli are and i can
hardli tell whi or in what the decept origin
sometim one is guid by what they say of themselv
and veri frequent by what other peopl say of them
without give oneself time to deliber and judg

but i thought it wa right elinor said mariann
to be guid wholli by the opinion of other peopl
i thought our judgment were given us mere to be subservi
to those of neighbour thi ha alway been your doctrin
i am sure

no mariann never my doctrin ha never aim
at the subject of the understand all i have
ever attempt to influenc ha been the behaviour
you must not confound my mean i am guilti i confess
of have often wish you to treat our acquaint
in gener with greater attention; but when have i advis
you to adopt their sentiment or to conform to their
judgment in seriou matters?

you have not been abl to bring your sister over to your
plan of gener civil said edward to elinor do you gain
no ground?

quit the contrari repli elinor
look express at mariann

my judgment he return is all on your side
of the question; but i am afraid my practic is much
more on your sister i never wish to offend but i
am so foolishli shi that i often seem neglig
when i am onli kept back by my natur awkward
i have frequent thought that i must have been intend
by natur to be fond of low compani i am so littl at
my eas among stranger of gentility!

mariann ha not shyness to excus ani inattent
of her said elinor

she know her own worth too well for fals shame
repli edward shyness is onli the effect of a sens
of inferior in some way or other if i could persuad
myself that my manner were perfectli easi and grace
i should not be shi

but you would still be reserv said mariann
and that is wors

edward started--reserved! am i reserv marianne?

ye veri

i do not understand you repli he colour
reserved!--how in what manner? what am i to tell you?
what can you suppose?

elinor look surpris at hi emotion; but tri
to laugh off the subject she said to him do not you
know my sister well enough to understand what she means?
do not you know she call everi one reserv who doe not
talk as fast and admir what she admir as raptur
as herself?

edward made no answer hi graviti and thought
return on him in their fullest extent--and he sat
for some time silent and dull



chapter 18


elinor saw with great uneasi the low spirit
of her friend hi visit afford her but a veri
partial satisfact while hi own enjoy in it
appear so imperfect it wa evid that he wa unhappy;
she wish it were equal evid that he still
distinguish her by the same affect which onc
she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the
continu of hi prefer seem veri uncertain;
and the reserved of hi manner toward her contradict
one moment what a more anim look had intim the preced
one

he join her and mariann in the breakfast-room
the next morn befor the other were down; and mariann
who wa alway eager to promot their happi as far
as she could soon left them to themselv but befor she
wa half way upstair she heard the parlour door open and
turn round wa astonish to see edward himself come out

i am go into the villag to see my hors
said be as you are not yet readi for breakfast; i shall
be back again present

***

edward return to them with fresh admir
of the surround country; in hi walk to the villag
he had seen mani part of the valley to advantage;
and the villag itself in a much higher situat than
the cottag afford a gener view of the whole which had
exceedingli pleas him thi wa a subject which ensur
mariann attent and she wa begin to describ
her own admir of these scene and to question him more
minut on the object that had particularli struck him
when edward interrupt her by say you must not
enquir too far marianne--rememb i have no knowledg
in the picturesqu and i shall offend you by my ignor
and want of tast if we come to particular i shall call
hill steep which ought to be bold; surfac strang
and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged;
and distant object out of sight which ought onli to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazi atmospher
you must be satisfi with such admir as i can
honestli give i call it a veri fine country--th
hill are steep the wood seem full of fine timber
and the valley look comfort and snug--with rich
meadow and sever neat farm hous scatter here
and there it exactli answer my idea of a fine countri
becaus it unit beauti with utility--and i dare say it
is a picturesqu one too becaus you admir it; i can
easili believ it to be full of rock and promontori
grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me
i know noth of the picturesqu

i am afraid it is but too true said marianne;
but whi should you boast of it?

i suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind
of affect edward here fall into anoth becaus he
believ mani peopl pretend to more admir of the beauti
of natur than they realli feel and is disgust with
such pretens he affect greater indiffer and less
discrimin in view them himself than he possess
he is fastidi and will have an affect of hi own

it is veri true said mariann that admir
of landscap sceneri is becom a mere jargon
everi bodi pretend to feel and tri to describ with
the tast and eleg of him who first defin what
picturesqu beauti wa i detest jargon of everi kind
and sometim i have kept my feel to myself
becaus i could find no languag to describ them
in but what wa worn and hackney out of all sens and mean

i am convinc said edward that you realli feel
all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess
to feel but in return your sister must allow me
to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect
but not on picturesqu principl i do not like crook
twist blast tree i admir them much more if they
are tall straight and flourish i do not like ruin
tatter cottag i am not fond of nettl or thistl
or heath blossom i have more pleasur in a snug
farm-hous than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidi
happi villag pleas me better than the finest banditti
in the world

mariann look with amaz at edward
with compass at her sister elinor onli laugh

the subject wa continu no farther; and mariann
remain thought silent till a new object suddenli
engag her attent she wa sit by edward and
in take hi tea from mr dashwood hi hand pass
so directli befor her as to make a ring with a plait
of hair in the centr veri conspicu on one of hi finger

i never saw you wear a ring befor edward she cri
is that fanni hair? i rememb her promis to give
you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker

mariann spoke inconsider what she realli felt--
but when she saw how much she had pain edward her own
vexat at her want of thought could not be surpass
by hi he colour veri deepli and give a momentari
glanc at elinor repli yes; it is my sister hair
the set alway cast a differ shade on it
you know

elinor had met hi eye and look consciou likewis
that the hair wa her own she instantan felt as
well satisfi as marianne; the onli differ in their
conclus wa that what mariann consid as a free
gift from her sister elinor wa consciou must have been
procur by some theft or contriv unknown to herself
she wa not in a humour howev to regard it as an affront
and affect to take no notic of what pass
by instantli talk of someth els she intern
resolv henceforward to catch everi opportun of eye
the hair and of satisfi herself beyond all doubt
that it wa exactli the shade of her own

edward embarrass last some time and it
end in an absenc of mind still more settl
he wa particularli grave the whole morn
mariann sever censur herself for what she had said;
but her own forgiv might have been more speedi
had she known how littl offenc it had given her sister

befor the middl of the day they were visit by sir
john and mr jen who have heard of the arriv
of a gentleman at the cottag came to take a survey
of the guest with the assist of hi mother-in-law
sir john wa not long in discov that the name of
ferrar began with an f and thi prepar a futur mine
of railleri against the devot elinor which noth but
the new of their acquaint with edward could have
prevent from be immedi sprung but as it wa
she onli learn from some veri signific look how far
their penetr found on margaret instruct extend

sir john never came to the dashwood without either
invit them to dine at the park the next day or to drink
tea with them that even on the present occas
for the better entertain of their visitor toward
whose amus he felt himself bound to contribut
he wish to engag them for both

you must drink tea with us to night said he
for we shall be quit alone--and tomorrow you must
absolut dine with us for we shall be a larg parti

mr jen enforc the necess and who know
but you may rais a danc said she and that will
tempt you miss mariann

a dance! cri mariann impossible! who is to dance?

who! whi yourselv and the carey and whitak
to be sure--what! you thought nobodi could danc
becaus a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!

i wish with all my soul cri sir john
that willoughbi were among us again

thi and mariann blush gave new suspicion
to edward and who is willoughby? said he in a low voic
to miss dashwood by whom he wa sit

she gave him a brief repli mariann counten
wa more commun edward saw enough to comprehend
not onli the mean of other but such of mariann
express as had puzzl him before; and when their
visitor left them he went immedi round her and said
in a whisper i have been guess shall i tell you
my guess?

what do you mean?

shall i tell you

certainli

well then; i guess that mr willoughbi hunt

mariann wa surpris and confus yet she could
not help smile at the quiet arch of hi manner
and after a moment silenc said

oh edward! how can you?--but the time will come
i hopei am sure you will like him

i do not doubt it repli he rather astonish
at her earnest and warmth; for had he not imagin it
to be a joke for the good of her acquaint in gener
found onli on a someth or a noth between mr willoughbi
and herself he would not have ventur to mention it



chapter 19


edward remain a week at the cottage; he wa earnestli
press by mr dashwood to stay longer; but as if he
were bent onli on self-mortif he seem resolv
to be gone when hi enjoy among hi friend wa at
the height hi spirit dure the last two or three day
though still veri unequ were greatli improved--h grew
more and more partial to the hous and environs--nev
spoke of go away without a sigh--declar hi time
to be wholli disengaged--even doubt to what place he
should go when he left them--but still go he must
never had ani week pass so quickly--h could hardli
believ it to be gone he said so repeatedly; other thing
he said too which mark the turn of hi feel and gave
the lie to hi action he had no pleasur at norland;
he detest be in town; but either to norland or london
he must go he valu their kind beyond ani thing
and hi greatest happi wa in be with them
yet he must leav them at the end of a week in spite
of their wish and hi own and without ani restraint
on hi time

elinor place all that wa astonish in thi
way of act to hi mother account; and it wa
happi for her that he had a mother whose charact
wa so imperfectli known to her as to be the gener
excus for everi thing strang on the part of her son
disappoint howev and vex as she wa and sometim
displeas with hi uncertain behaviour to herself
she wa veri well dispos on the whole to regard hi action
with all the candid allow and gener qualif
which had been rather more pain extort from her
for willoughbi servic by her mother hi want of spirit
of open and of consist were most usual
attribut to hi want of independ and hi better
knowledg of mr ferrarss disposit and design
the short of hi visit the steadi of hi purpos
in leav them origin in the same fetter inclin
the same inevit necess of tempor with hi mother
the old well-establish grievanc of duti against will
parent against child wa the caus of all she would have
been glad to know when these difficulti were to ceas
thi opposit wa to yield--when mr ferrar would
be reform and her son be at liberti to be happi
but from such vain wish she wa forc to turn for comfort
to the renew of her confid in edward affect
to the remembr of everi mark of regard in look or word
which fell from him while at barton and abov all
to that flatter proof of it which he constantli wore
round hi finger

i think edward said mr dashwood as they were
at breakfast the last morn you would be a happier man
if you had ani profess to engag your time and give
an interest to your plan and action some inconveni
to your friend inde might result from it--you
would not be abl to give them so much of your time
but (with a smile) you would be materi benefit
in one particular at least--you would know where to go
when you left them

i do assur you he repli that i have long
thought on thi point as you think now it ha been
and is and probabl will alway be a heavi misfortun
to me that i have had no necessari busi to engag me
no profess to give me employ or afford me ani
thing like independ but unfortun my own niceti
and the niceti of my friend have made me what i am
an idl helpless be we never could agre in our
choic of a profess i alway prefer the church
as i still do but that wa not smart enough for my famili
they recommend the armi that wa a great deal
too smart for me the law wa allow to be genteel
enough; mani young men who had chamber in the templ
made a veri good appear in the first circl
and drove about town in veri know gig but i had
no inclin for the law even in thi less abstrus
studi of it which my famili approv as for the navi
it had fashion on it side but i wa too old when the
subject wa first start to enter it--and at length
as there wa no necess for my have ani profess
at all as i might be as dash and expens without
a red coat on my back as with one idl wa pronounc
on the whole to be most advantag and honour
and a young man of eighteen is not in gener so earnestli
bent on be busi as to resist the solicit of hi
friend to do noth i wa therefor enter at oxford
and have been properli idl ever sinc

the consequ of which i suppos will be
said mr dashwood sinc leisur ha not promot
your own happi that your son will be brought up
to as mani pursuit employ profess and trade
as columella

they will be brought up said he in a seriou accent
to be as unlik myself as is possibl in feel
in action in condit in everi thing

come come; thi is all an effus of immedi
want of spirit edward you are in a melancholi humour
and fanci that ani one unlik yourself must be happi
but rememb that the pain of part from friend
will be felt by everi bodi at time whatev be their
educ or state know your own happi you want
noth but patience--or give it a more fascin name
call it hope your mother will secur to you in time
that independ you are so anxiou for; it is her duti
and it will it must ere long becom her happi to
prevent your whole youth from be wast in discont
how much may not a few month do?

i think repli edward that i may defi mani
month to produc ani good to me

thi despond turn of mind though it could not
be commun to mr dashwood gave addit pain
to them all in the part which shortli took place
and left an uncomfort impress on elinor
feel especi which requir some troubl and time
to subdu but as it wa her determin to subdu it
and to prevent herself from appear to suffer more than
what all her famili suffer on hi go away she did
not adopt the method so judici employ by mariann
on a similar occas to augment and fix her sorrow
by seek silenc solitud and idl their mean
were as differ as their object and equal suit
to the advanc of each

elinor sat down to her drawing-t as soon as he
wa out of the hous busili employ herself the whole day
neither sought nor avoid the mention of hi name
appear to interest herself almost as much as ever in the
gener concern of the famili and if by thi conduct
she did not lessen her own grief it wa at least prevent
from unnecessari increas and her mother and sister
were spare much solicitud on her account

such behaviour as thi so exactli the revers
of her own appear no more meritori to mariann
than her own had seem faulti to her the busi
of self-command she settl veri easily;--with strong
affect it wa imposs with calm one it could
have no merit that her sister affect were calm
she dare not deni though she blush to acknowledg it;
and of the strength of her own she gave a veri strike proof
by still love and respect that sister in spite
of thi mortifi convict

without shut herself up from her famili
or leav the hous in determin solitud to avoid them
or lie awak the whole night to indulg medit
elinor found everi day afford her leisur enough
to think of edward and of edward behaviour in everi
possibl varieti which the differ state of her spirit
at differ time could produce--with tender
piti approb censur and doubt there were moment
in abund when if not by the absenc of her mother
and sister at least by the natur of their employ
convers wa forbidden among them and everi effect
of solitud wa produc her mind wa inevit
at liberty; her thought could not be chain elsewhere;
and the past and the futur on a subject so interest
must be befor her must forc her attent and engross
her memori her reflect and her fanci

from a reveri of thi kind as she sat at her
drawing-t she wa rous one morn soon after
edward leav them by the arriv of compani
she happen to be quit alon the close of the
littl gate at the entranc of the green court in front
of the hous drew her eye to the window and she saw
a larg parti walk up to the door amongst them
were sir john and ladi middleton and mr jen
but there were two other a gentleman and ladi who were
quit unknown to her she wa sit near the window
and as soon as sir john perceiv her he left the rest
of the parti to the ceremoni of knock at the door
and step across the turf oblig her to open the
casement to speak to him though the space wa so short
between the door and the window as to make it hardli
possibl to speak at one without be heard at the other

well said he we have brought you some stranger
how do you like them?

hush! they will hear you

never mind if they do it is onli the palmer
charlott is veri pretti i can tell you you may see her
if you look thi way

as elinor wa certain of see her in a coupl
of minut without take that liberti she beg
to be excus

where is marianne? ha she run away becaus we
are come? i see her instrument is open

she is walk i believ

they were now join by mr jen who had not
patienc enough to wait till the door wa open befor
she told her stori she came halloo to the window
how do you do my dear? how doe mr dashwood do?
and where are your sisters? what! all alone! you
will be glad of a littl compani to sit with you
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you
onli think of their come so suddenly! i thought i heard
a carriag last night while we were drink our tea
but it never enter my head that it could be them
i thought of noth but whether it might not be colonel
brandon come back again; so i said to sir john i do think
i hear a carriage; perhap it is colonel brandon come
back again--

elinor wa oblig to turn from her in the middl
of her stori to receiv the rest of the party; ladi
middleton introduc the two strangers; mr dashwood
and margaret came down stair at the same time and they
all sat down to look at one anoth while mr jen
continu her stori as she walk through the passag
into the parlour attend by sir john

mr palmer wa sever year younger than ladi
middleton and total unlik her in everi respect
she wa short and plump had a veri pretti face
and the finest express of good humour in it that could
possibl be her manner were by no mean so eleg
as her sister but they were much more prepossess
she came in with a smile smile all the time of her visit
except when she laugh and smile when she went away
her husband wa a grave look young man of five or six
and twenti with an air of more fashion and sens than
hi wife but of less willing to pleas or be pleas
he enter the room with a look of self-consequ
slightli bow to the ladi without speak a word
and after briefli survey them and their apart
took up a newspap from the tabl and continu to read it
as long as he staid

mr palmer on the contrari who wa strongli endow
by natur with a turn for be uniformli civil and happi
wa hardli seat befor her admir of the parlour
and everi thing in it burst forth

well! what a delight room thi is! i never
saw anyth so charming! onli think mamma how it
is improv sinc i wa here last! i alway thought it
such a sweet place maam! (turn to mr dashwood)
but you have made it so charming! onli look sister
how delight everi thing is! how i should like such
a hous for myself! should not you mr palmer?

mr palmer made her no answer and did not even rais
hi eye from the newspap

mr palmer doe not hear me said she laughing;
he never doe sometim it is so ridiculous!

thi wa quit a new idea to mr dashwood; she had
never been use to find wit in the inattent of ani one
and could not help look with surpris at them both

mr jen in the meantim talk on as loud
as she could and continu her account of their surpris
the even befor on see their friend without
ceas till everi thing wa told mr palmer laugh
heartili at the recollect of their astonish
and everi bodi agre two or three time over that it
had been quit an agreeabl surpris

you may believ how glad we all were to see them
ad mr jen lean forward toward elinor
and speak in a low voic as if she meant to be heard
by no one els though they were seat on differ side
of the room; but howev i cant help wish they had
not travel quit so fast nor made such a long journey
of it for they came all round by london upon account
of some busi for you know (nod significantli and
point to her daughter) it wa wrong in her situat
i want her to stay at home and rest thi morn
but she would come with us; she long so much to see
you all!

mr palmer laugh and said it would not do her
ani harm

she expect to be confin in februari
continu mr jen

ladi middleton could no longer endur such a convers
and therefor exert herself to ask mr palmer if there
wa ani news in the paper

no none at all he repli and read on

here come mariann cri sir john now palmer
you shall see a monstrou pretti girl

he immedi went into the passag open the front door
and usher her in himself mr jen ask her
as soon as she appear if she had not been to allenham;
and mr palmer laugh so heartili at the question
as to show she understood it mr palmer look up
on her enter the room stare at her some minut
and then return to hi newspap mr palmer eye
wa now caught by the draw which hung round the room
she got up to examin them

oh! dear how beauti these are! well! how delightful!
do but look mama how sweet! i declar they are quit charming;
i could look at them for ever and then sit down again
she veri soon forgot that there were ani such thing in the room

when ladi middleton rose to go away mr palmer
rose also laid down the newspap stretch himself
and look at them all around

my love have you been asleep? said hi wife laugh

he made her no answer; and onli observ after again
examin the room that it wa veri low pitch
and that the ceil wa crook he then made hi bow
and depart with the rest

sir john had been veri urgent with them all to
spend the next day at the park mr dashwood who did
not chuse to dine with them often than they dine
at the cottag absolut refus on her own account;
her daughter might do as they pleas but they had no
curios to see how mr and mr palmer ate their dinner
and no expect of pleasur from them in ani other way
they attempt therefor likewis to excus themselves;
the weather wa uncertain and not like to be good
but sir john would not be satisfied--th carriag should
be sent for them and they must come ladi middleton too
though she did not press their mother press them
mr jen and mr palmer join their entreati all
seem equal anxiou to avoid a famili party; and the young
ladi were oblig to yield

whi should they ask us? said mariann as soon as they
were gone the rent of thi cottag is said to be low;
but we have it on veri hard term if we are to dine
at the park whenev ani one is stay either with them
or with us

they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now
said elinor by these frequent invit than by
those which we receiv from them a few week ago
the alter is not in them if their parti are grown
tediou and dull we must look for the chang elsewher



chapter 20


as the miss dashwood enter the drawing-room of the park
the next day at one door mr palmer came run in at
the other look as good humour and merri as befor
she took them all most affection by the hand
and express great delight in see them again

i am so glad to see you! said she seat herself
between elinor and mariann for it is so bad a day i wa
afraid you might not come which would be a shock thing
as we go away again tomorrow we must go for the weston
come to us next week you know it wa quit a sudden thing
our come at all and i knew noth of it till the carriag
wa come to the door and then mr palmer ask me if i
would go with him to barton he is so droll! he never
tell me ani thing! i am so sorri we cannot stay longer;
howev we shall meet again in town veri soon i hope

they were oblig to put an end to such an expect

not go to town! cri mr palmer with a laugh
i shall be quit disappoint if you do not i could
get the nicest hous in world for you next door to our
in hanover-squar you must come inde i am sure
i shall be veri happi to chaperon you at ani time till
i am confin if mr dashwood should not like to go
into public

they thank her; but were oblig to resist all
her entreati

oh my love cri mr palmer to her husband
who just then enter the room--you must help me to
persuad the miss dashwood to go to town thi winter

her love made no answer; and after slightli bow
to the ladi began complain of the weather

how horrid all thi is! said he such weather
make everi thing and everi bodi disgust dull
is as much produc within door as without by rain
it make one detest all one acquaint what the
devil doe sir john mean by not have a billiard room
in hi house? how few peopl know what comfort is! sir
john is as stupid as the weather

the rest of the compani soon dropt in

i am afraid miss mariann said sir john you have
not been abl to take your usual walk to allenham today

mariann look veri grave and said noth

oh dont be so sli befor us said mr palmer;
for we know all about it i assur you; and i admir your
tast veri much for i think he is extrem handsom
we do not live a great way from him in the countri you know
not abov ten mile i dare say

much nearer thirti said her husband

ah well! there is not much differ
i never wa at hi house; but they say it is a sweet
pretti place

as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life
said mr palmer

mariann remain perfectli silent though her
counten betray her interest in what wa said

is it veri ugly? continu mr palmer--then it
must be some other place that is so pretti i suppos

when they were seat in the dine room sir john
observ with regret that they were onli eight all togeth

my dear said he to hi ladi it is veri provok
that we should be so few whi did not you ask the gilbert
to come to us today?

did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me
about it befor that it could not be done? they dine
with us last

you and i sir john said mr jen
should not stand upon such ceremoni

then you would be veri ill-br cri mr palmer

my love you contradict everi bodi said hi wife
with her usual laugh do you know that you are quit rude?

i did not know i contradict ani bodi in call
your mother ill-br

ay you may abus me as you pleas said the good-natur
old ladi you have taken charlott off my hand and cannot
give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you

charlott laugh heartili to think that her
husband could not get rid of her; and exultingli said
she did not care how cross he wa to her as they must
live togeth it wa imposs for ani one to be more
thoroughli good-natur or more determin to be happi
than mr palmer the studi indiffer insol
and discont of her husband gave her no pain;
and when he scold or abus her she wa highli divert

mr palmer is so droll! said she in a whisper
to elinor he is alway out of humour

elinor wa not inclin after a littl observ
to give him credit for be so genuin and unaffectedli
ill-natur or ill-br as he wish to appear
hi temper might perhap be a littl sour by find
like mani other of hi sex that through some unaccount
bia in favour of beauti he wa the husband of a veri silli
woman--but she knew that thi kind of blunder wa too
common for ani sensibl man to be lastingli hurt by it--
it wa rather a wish of distinct she believ
which produc hi contemptu treatment of everi bodi
and hi gener abus of everi thing befor him
it wa the desir of appear superior to other peopl
the motiv wa too common to be wonder at; but the mean
howev they might succeed by establish hi superior
in ill-breed were not like to attach ani one to him
except hi wife

oh my dear miss dashwood said mr palmer soon afterward
i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister
will you come and spend some time at cleveland thi
christmas? now pray do--and come while the weston are
with us you cannot think how happi i shall be! it will
be quit delightful!--mi love appli to her husband
dont you long to have the miss dashwood come to cleveland?

certainli he repli with a sneer--i came
into devonshir with no other view

there now--said hi ladi you see mr palmer
expect you; so you cannot refus to come

they both eagerli and resolut declin her invit

but inde you must and shall come i am sure you
will like it of all thing the weston will be with us
and it will be quit delight you cannot think
what a sweet place cleveland is; and we are so gay now
for mr palmer is alway go about the countri canvass
against the election; and so mani peopl came to dine
with us that i never saw befor it is quit charming! but
poor fellow! it is veri fatigu to him! for he is forc
to make everi bodi like him

elinor could hardli keep her counten as she
assent to the hardship of such an oblig

how charm it will be said charlott when he
is in parliament!--wont it? how i shall laugh! it will
be so ridicul to see all hi letter direct to him
with an mp--but do you know he say he will never frank
for me? he declar he wont dont you mr palmer?

mr palmer took no notic of her

he cannot bear write you know she continued--
he say it is quit shock

no said he i never said ani thing so irrat
dont palm all your abus of languag upon me

there now; you see how droll he is thi is alway
the way with him! sometim he wont speak to me for half
a day togeth and then he come out with someth
so droll--al about ani thing in the world

she surpris elinor veri much as they return
into the drawing-room by ask her whether she did
not like mr palmer excess

certainli said elinor; he seem veri agreeabl

well--i am so glad you do i thought you would
he is so pleasant; and mr palmer is excess pleas
with you and your sister i can tell you and you cant
think how disappoint he will be if you dont come
to cleveland--i cant imagin whi you should object
to it

elinor wa again oblig to declin her invitation;
and by chang the subject put a stop to her entreati
she thought it probabl that as they live in the
same counti mr palmer might be abl to give some
more particular account of willoughbi gener
charact than could be gather from the middleton
partial acquaint with him; and she wa eager to gain
from ani one such a confirm of hi merit as might
remov the possibl of fear from mariann she began
by inquir if they saw much of mr willoughbi at cleveland
and whether they were intim acquaint with him

oh dear yes; i know him extrem well
repli mr palmer;--not that i ever spoke
to him indeed; but i have seen him for ever in town
somehow or other i never happen to be stay at barton
while he wa at allenham mama saw him here onc before;--
but i wa with my uncl at weymouth howev i dare say
we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshir
if it had not happen veri unluckili that we should never
have been in the countri togeth he is veri littl
at comb i believe; but if he were ever so much there
i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is
in the opposit you know and besid it is such a
way off i know whi you inquir about him veri well;
your sister is to marri him i am monstrou glad of it
for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know

upon my word repli elinor you know much
more of the matter than i do if you have ani reason
to expect such a match

dont pretend to deni it becaus you know it is
what everi bodi talk of i assur you i heard of it
in my way through town

my dear mr palmer!

upon my honour i did--i met colonel brandon
monday morn in bond-street just befor we left town
and he told me of it directli

you surpris me veri much colonel brandon tell
you of it! sure you must be mistaken to give such
intellig to a person who could not be interest in it
even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel
brandon to do

but i do assur you it wa so for all that
and i will tell you how it happen when we met him
he turn back and walk with us; and so we began talk
of my brother and sister and one thing and anoth
and i said to him so colonel there is a new famili
come to barton cottag i hear and mama send me word
they are veri pretti and that one of them is go to be
marri to mr willoughbi of comb magna is it true
pray? for of cours you must know as you have been in
devonshir so late

and what did the colonel say?

oh--h did not say much; but he look as if he
knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down
as certain it will be quit delight i declare!
when is it to take place?

mr brandon wa veri well i hope?

oh! ye quit well; and so full of your prais
he did noth but say fine thing of you

i am flatter by hi commend he seem
an excel man; and i think him uncommonli pleas

so do i--h is such a charm man that it
is quit a piti he should be so grave and so dull
mamma say he wa in love with your sister too--
i assur you it wa a great compliment if he wa for he
hardli ever fall in love with ani bodi

is mr willoughbi much known in your part
of somersetshire? said elinor

oh! ye extrem well; that is i do not believ
mani peopl are acquaint with him becaus comb magna
is so far off; but they all think him extrem agreeabl
i assur you nobodi is more like than mr willoughbi
wherev he goe and so you may tell your sister
she is a monstrou lucki girl to get him upon my honour;
not but that he is much more lucki in get her
becaus she is so veri handsom and agreeabl that noth
can be good enough for her howev i dont think
her hardli at all handsom than you i assur you;
for i think you both excess pretti and so doe
mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him
to own it last night

mr palmer inform respect willoughbi
wa not veri material; but ani testimoni in hi favour
howev small wa pleas to her

i am so glad we are got acquaint at last
continu charlotte--and now i hope we shall alway be
great friend you cant think how much i long to see you!
it is so delight that you should live at the cottage!
noth can be like it to be sure! and i am so glad
your sister is go to be well married! i hope you will
be a great deal at comb magna it is a sweet place
by all account

you have been long acquaint with colonel brandon
have not you?

ye a great while; ever sinc my sister married--
he wa a particular friend of sir john i believ
she ad in a low voic he would have been veri
glad to have had me if he could sir john and ladi
middleton wish it veri much but mama did not think
the match good enough for me otherwis sir john would
have mention it to the colonel and we should have been
marri immedi

did not colonel brandon know of sir john propos
to your mother befor it wa made? had he never own
hi affect to yourself?

oh no; but if mama had not object to it
i dare say he would have like it of all thing
he had not seen me then abov twice for it wa befor
i left school howev i am much happier as i am
mr palmer is the kind of man i like



chapter 21


the palmer return to cleveland the next day
and the two famili at barton were again left to entertain
each other but thi did not last long; elinor had hardli
got their last visitor out of her head had hardli done
wonder at charlott be so happi without a caus
at mr palmer act so simpli with good abil
and at the strang unsuit which often exist between
husband and wife befor sir john and mr jenningss
activ zeal in the caus of societi procur her some
other new acquaint to see and observ

in a morn excurs to exet they had met with
two young ladi whom mr jen had the satisfact
of discov to be her relat and thi wa enough
for sir john to invit them directli to the park
as soon as their present engag at exet were over
their engag at exet instantli gave way befor
such an invit and ladi middleton wa thrown into
no littl alarm on the return of sir john by hear
that she wa veri soon to receiv a visit from two girl
whom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance--
whose toler gentil even she could have no proof;
for the assur of her husband and mother on that subject
went for noth at all their be her relat too
made it so much the worse; and mr jenningss attempt
at consol were therefor unfortun found
when she advis her daughter not to care about their be
so fashionable; becaus they were all cousin and must put
up with one anoth as it wa imposs howev now to
prevent their come ladi middleton resign herself to the
idea of it with all the philosophi of a well-br woman
content herself with mere give her husband a gentl
reprimand on the subject five or six time everi day

the young ladi arrived: their appear wa by
no mean ungenteel or unfashion their dress wa
veri smart their manner veri civil they were delight
with the hous and in raptur with the furnitur
and they happen to be so doatingli fond of children
that ladi middleton good opinion wa engag in their
favour befor they had been an hour at the park
she declar them to be veri agreeabl girl inde
which for her ladyship wa enthusiast admir
sir john confid in hi own judgment rose with thi
anim prais and he set off directli for the cottag
to tell the miss dashwood of the miss steel arriv
and to assur them of their be the sweetest girl
in the world from such commend as thi howev
there wa not much to be learned; elinor well knew
that the sweetest girl in the world were to be met
with in everi part of england under everi possibl
variat of form face temper and understand
sir john want the whole famili to walk to the park directli
and look at hi guest benevol philanthrop man! it
wa pain to him even to keep a third cousin to himself

do come now said he--pray come--y must come--i
declar you shall come--y cant think how you will
like them luci is monstrou pretti and so good humour
and agreeable! the children are all hang about her alreadi
as if she wa an old acquaint and they both long
to see you of all thing for they have heard at exet
that you are the most beauti creatur in the world;
and i have told them it is all veri true and a great
deal more you will be delight with them i am sure
they have brought the whole coach full of playth
for the children how can you be so cross as not to come?
whi they are your cousin you know after a fashion
you are my cousin and they are my wife so you must
be relat

but sir john could not prevail he could onli obtain
a promis of their call at the park within a day or two
and then left them in amaz at their indiffer
to walk home and boast anew of their attract to the
miss steel as he had been alreadi boast of the miss
steel to them

when their promis visit to the park and consequ
introduct to these young ladi took place they found
in the appear of the eldest who wa nearli thirti
with a veri plain and not a sensibl face noth to admire;
but in the other who wa not more than two or three
and twenti they acknowledg consider beauty; her
featur were pretti and she had a sharp quick eye
and a smart of air which though it did not give
actual eleg or grace gave distinct to her person--
their manner were particularli civil and elinor soon
allow them credit for some kind of sens when she
saw with what constant and judici attent they
were make themselv agreeabl to ladi middleton
with her children they were in continu raptur
extol their beauti court their notic and humour
their whims; and such of their time as could be spare from
the importun demand which thi polit made on it
wa spent in admir of whatev her ladyship wa do
if she happen to be do ani thing or in take pattern
of some eleg new dress in which her appear
the day befor had thrown them into unceas delight
fortun for those who pay their court through
such foibl a fond mother though in pursuit of prais
for her children the most rapaci of human be
is likewis the most credulous; her demand are exorbitant;
but she will swallow ani thing; and the excess
affect and endur of the miss steel toward
her offspr were view therefor by ladi middleton
without the smallest surpris or distrust she saw with
matern complac all the impertin encroach
and mischiev trick to which her cousin submit
she saw their sash unti their hair pull about
their ear their work-bag search and their knive
and scissor stolen away and felt no doubt of it be
a reciproc enjoy it suggest no other surpris
than that elinor and mariann should sit so composedli by
without claim a share in what wa pass

john is in such spirit today! said she on hi
take miss steeless pocket handkerchief and throw
it out of window--h is full of monkey trick

and soon afterward on the second boy violent
pinch one of the same ladi finger she fondli observ
how play william is!

and here is my sweet littl annamaria she ad
tenderli caress a littl girl of three year old
who had not made a nois for the last two minutes;
and she is alway so gentl and quiet--nev wa there
such a quiet littl thing!

but unfortun in bestow these embrac
a pin in her ladyship head dress slightli scratch
the child neck produc from thi pattern of gentl
such violent scream as could hardli be outdon by ani
creatur professedli noisi the mother constern
wa excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the
miss steel and everi thing wa done by all three
in so critic an emerg which affect could suggest
as like to assuag the agoni of the littl suffer
she wa seat in her mother lap cover with kiss
her wound bath with lavender-wat by one of the
miss steel who wa on her knee to attend her
and her mouth stuf with sugar plum by the other
with such a reward for her tear the child wa too wise
to ceas cri she still scream and sob lustili
kick her two brother for offer to touch her and all
their unit sooth were ineffectu till ladi middleton
luckili rememb that in a scene of similar distress
last week some apricot marmalad had been success
appli for a bruis templ the same remedi wa eagerli
propos for thi unfortun scratch and a slight
intermiss of scream in the young ladi on hear it
gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected--
she wa carri out of the room therefor in her
mother arm in quest of thi medicin and as the
two boy chose to follow though earnestli entreat
by their mother to stay behind the four young ladi
were left in a quiet which the room had not known for
mani hour

poor littl creatures! said miss steel as soon
as they were gone it might have been a veri sad accid

yet i hardli know how cri mariann unless it
had been under total differ circumst
but thi is the usual way of heighten alarm where there
is noth to be alarm at in realiti

what a sweet woman ladi middleton is! said luci steel

mariann wa silent; it wa imposs for her to say
what she did not feel howev trivial the occasion;
and upon elinor therefor the whole task of tell lie
when polit requir it alway fell she did her
best when thu call on by speak of ladi middleton
with more warmth than she felt though with far less than
miss luci

and sir john too cri the elder sister
what a charm man he is!

here too miss dashwood commend be onli
simpl and just came in without ani eclat she mere
observ that he wa perfectli good humour and friendli

and what a charm littl famili they have! i
never saw such fine children in my life--i declar i
quit doat upon them alreadi and inde i am alway
distractedli fond of children

i should guess so said elinor with a smile
from what i have wit thi morn

i have a notion said luci you think the littl
middleton rather too much indulged; perhap they may be the
outsid of enough; but it is so natur in ladi middleton;
and for my part i love to see children full of life
and spirits; i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet

i confess repli elinor that while i am at
barton park i never think of tame and quiet children
with ani abhorr

a short paus succeed thi speech which wa first
broken by miss steel who seem veri much dispos
for convers and who now said rather abruptli
and how do you like devonshir miss dashwood? i suppos
you were veri sorri to leav sussex

in some surpris at the familiar of thi question
or at least of the manner in which it wa spoken
elinor repli that she wa

norland is a prodigi beauti place is not it?
ad miss steel

we have heard sir john admir it excess
said luci who seem to think some apolog necessari
for the freedom of her sister

i think everi one must admir it repli elinor
who ever saw the place; though it is not to be suppos
that ani one can estim it beauti as we do

and had you a great mani smart beaux there? i
suppos you have not so mani in thi part of the world;
for my part i think they are a vast addit alway

but whi should you think said luci look asham
of her sister that there are not as mani genteel young
men in devonshir as sussex?

nay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there
ant im sure there a vast mani smart beaux in exeter;
but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there
might be about norland; and i wa onli afraid the miss
dashwood might find it dull at barton if they had not
so mani as they use to have but perhap you young ladi
may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without
them as with them for my part i think they are vastli
agreeabl provid they dress smart and behav civil
but i cant bear to see them dirti and nasti now there
mr rose at exet a prodigi smart young man
quit a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you
do but meet him of a morn he is not fit to be seen--
i suppos your brother wa quit a beau miss dashwood
befor he marri as he wa so rich?

upon my word repli elinor i cannot tell you
for i do not perfectli comprehend the mean of the word
but thi i can say that if he ever wa a beau befor
he marri he is one still for there is not the smallest
alter in him

oh! dear! one never think of marri men be
beaux--they have someth els to do

lord! ann cri her sister you can talk of
noth but beaux;--you will make miss dashwood believ you
think of noth els and then to turn the discours
she began admir the hous and the furnitur

thi specimen of the miss steel wa enough
the vulgar freedom and folli of the eldest left
her no recommend and as elinor wa not blind
by the beauti or the shrewd look of the youngest
to her want of real eleg and artless she left
the hous without ani wish of know them better

not so the miss steeles--they came from exet well
provid with admir for the use of sir john middleton
hi famili and all hi relat and no niggardli
proport wa now dealt out to hi fair cousin whom they
declar to be the most beauti eleg accomplish
and agreeabl girl they had ever beheld and with whom
they were particularli anxiou to be better acquainted--
and to be better acquaint therefor elinor soon found
wa their inevit lot for as sir john wa entir
on the side of the miss steel their parti would be
too strong for opposit and that kind of intimaci
must be submit to which consist of sit an hour
or two togeth in the same room almost everi day
sir john could do no more; but he did not know that ani
more wa required: to be togeth wa in hi opinion
to be intim and while hi continu scheme for their
meet were effectu he had not a doubt of their be
establish friend

to do him justic he did everi thing in hi power
to promot their unreserv by make the miss steel
acquaint with whatev he knew or suppos of hi cousin
situat in the most delic particulars--and elinor
had not seen them more than twice befor the eldest of
them wish her joy on her sister have been so lucki
as to make a conquest of a veri smart beau sinc she
came to barton

twill be a fine thing to have her marri so young
to be sure said she and i hear he is quit a beau
and prodigi handsom and i hope you may have as good
luck yourself soon--but perhap you may have a friend
in the corner alreadi

elinor could not suppos that sir john would be more
nice in proclaim hi suspicion of her regard for edward
than he had been with respect to marianne; inde it wa
rather hi favourit joke of the two as be somewhat
newer and more conjectural; and sinc edward visit
they had never dine togeth without hi drink to her
best affect with so much signific and so mani nod
and wink as to excit gener attent the letter f--
had been likewis invari brought forward and found
product of such countless joke that it charact
as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long
establish with elinor

the miss steel as she expect had now all the
benefit of these joke and in the eldest of them they
rais a curios to know the name of the gentleman
allud to which though often impertin express
wa perfectli of a piec with her gener inquisit
into the concern of their famili but sir john did not
sport long with the curios which he delight to rais
for he had at least as much pleasur in tell the name
as miss steel had in hear it

hi name is ferrar said he in a veri audibl whisper;
but pray do not tell it for it a great secret

ferrars! repeat miss steele; mr ferrar is
the happi man is he? what! your sister-in-law brother
miss dashwood? a veri agreeabl young man to be sure;
i know him veri well

how can you say so anne? cri luci who gener
made an amend to all her sister assert
though we have seen him onc or twice at my uncl it
is rather too much to pretend to know him veri well

elinor heard all thi with attent and surpris
and who wa thi uncle? where did he live? how came
they acquainted? she wish veri much to have the subject
continu though she did not chuse to join in it herself;
but noth more of it wa said and for the first time
in her life she thought mr jen defici either
in curios after petti inform or in a disposit
to commun it the manner in which miss steel had
spoken of edward increas her curiosity; for it struck
her as be rather ill-natur and suggest the suspicion
of that ladi know or fanci herself to know someth
to hi disadvantage--but her curios wa unavail
for no farther notic wa taken of mr ferrarss name by
miss steel when allud to or even openli mention by sir
john



chapter 22


mariann who had never much toler for ani
thing like impertin vulgar inferior of part
or even differ of tast from herself wa at
thi time particularli ill-dispos from the state
of her spirit to be pleas with the miss steel
or to encourag their advances; and to the invari
cold of her behaviour toward them which check everi
endeavour at intimaci on their side elinor princip
attribut that prefer of herself which soon becam
evid in the manner of both but especi of luci
who miss no opportun of engag her in convers
or of strive to improv their acquaint by an easi
and frank commun of her sentiment

luci wa natur clever; her remark were often
just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour
elinor frequent found her agreeable; but her power
had receiv no aid from education: she wa ignor
and illiterate; and her defici of all mental improv
her want of inform in the most common particular
could not be conceal from miss dashwood in spite of her
constant endeavour to appear to advantag elinor saw
and piti her for the neglect of abil which educ
might have render so respectable; but she saw with less
tender of feel the thorough want of delicaci
of rectitud and integr of mind which her attent
her assidu her flatteri at the park betrayed;
and she could have no last satisfact in the compani
of a person who join insincer with ignorance;
whose want of instruct prevent their meet
in convers on term of equal and whose conduct
toward other made everi shew of attent and defer
toward herself perfectli valueless

you will think my question an odd one i dare say
said luci to her one day as they were walk togeth
from the park to the cottage--but pray are you
person acquaint with your sister-in-law mother
mr ferrars?

elinor did think the question a veri odd one
and her counten express it as she answer that she
had never seen mr ferrar

indeed! repli lucy; i wonder at that for i
thought you must have seen her at norland sometim
then perhap you cannot tell me what sort of a woman
she is?

no return elinor cautiou of give her real
opinion of edward mother and not veri desir
of satisfi what seem impertin curiosity--
i know noth of her

i am sure you think me veri strang for enquir
about her in such a way said luci eye elinor attent
as she spoke; but perhap there may be reasons--i wish
i might venture; but howev i hope you will do me the justic
of believ that i do not mean to be impertin

elinor made her a civil repli and they walk on
for a few minut in silenc it wa broken by luci
who renew the subject again by say with some
hesit

i cannot bear to have you think me impertin curiou
i am sure i would rather do ani thing in the world than be
thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth
have as your and i am sure i should not have the smallest
fear of trust you; inde i should be veri glad of your
advic how to manag in such and uncomfort situat
as i am; but howev there is no occas to troubl you
i am sorri you do not happen to know mr ferrar

i am sorri i do not said elinor in great astonish
if it could be of ani use to you to know my opinion of her
but realli i never understood that you were at all connect
with that famili and therefor i am a littl surpris
i confess at so seriou an inquiri into her charact

i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all
wonder at it but if i dare tell you all you would not be
so much surpris mr ferrar is certainli noth to me
at present--but the time may come--how soon it will come
must depend upon herself--when we may be veri intim
connect

she look down as she said thi amiabl bash
with onli one side glanc at her companion to observ it
effect on her

good heavens! cri elinor what do you mean?
are you acquaint with mr robert ferrars? can you be?
and she did not feel much delight with the idea of such
a sister-in-law

no repli luci not to mr robert ferrars--i
never saw him in my life; but fix her eye upon elinor
to hi eldest brother

what felt elinor at that moment? astonish
that would have been as pain as it wa strong had not
an immedi disbelief of the assert attend it
she turn toward luci in silent amaz unabl to divin
the reason or object of such a declaration; and though
her complexion vari she stood firm in incredul
and felt in no danger of an hyster fit or a swoon

you may well be surpris continu lucy;
for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;
for i dare say he never drop the smallest hint of it
to you or ani of your family; becaus it wa alway meant
to be a great secret and i am sure ha been faith
kept so by me to thi hour not a soul of all my relat
know of it but ann and i never should have mention
it to you if i had not felt the greatest depend
in the world upon your secrecy; and i realli thought my
behaviour in ask so mani question about mr ferrar
must seem so odd that it ought to be explain
and i do not think mr ferrar can be displeas
when he know i have trust you becaus i know he ha
the highest opinion in the world of all your famili
and look upon yourself and the other miss dashwood quit
as hi own sisters--sh paus

elinor for a few moment remain silent
her astonish at what she heard wa at first too
great for words; but at length forc herself to speak
and to speak cautious she said with calm of manner
which toler well conceal her surpris and solicitude--
may i ask if your engag is of long standing?

we have been engag these four year

four years!

ye

elinor though greatli shock still felt unabl
to believ it

i did not know said she that you were even
acquaint till the other day

our acquaint howev is of mani year date
he wa under my uncl care you know a consider while

your uncle!

yes; mr pratt did you never hear him talk
of mr pratt?

i think i have repli elinor with an exert
of spirit which increas with her increas of emot

he wa four year with my uncl who live at longstapl
near plymouth it wa there our acquaint begun
for my sister and me wa often stay with my uncl
and it wa there our engag wa form though not till
a year after he had quit as a pupil; but he wa almost
alway with us afterward i wa veri unwil to enter
into it as you may imagin without the knowledg and
approb of hi mother; but i wa too young and love
him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been--
though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood
you must have seen enough of him to be sensibl he is
veri capabl of make a woman sincer attach to him

certainli answer elinor without know what
she said; but after a moment reflect she ad
with reviv secur of edward honour and love
and her companion falsehood--engag to mr edward
ferrars!--i confess myself so total surpris at
what you tell me that really--i beg your pardon;
but sure there must be some mistak of person or name
we cannot mean the same mr ferrar

we can mean no other cri luci smile mr edward
ferrar the eldest son of mr ferrar of park street
and brother of your sister-in-law mr john dashwood
is the person i mean; you must allow that i am not like
to be deceiv as to the name of the man on who all my happi
depend

it is strang repli elinor in a most pain perplex
that i should never have heard him even mention your name

no; consid our situat it wa not strang
our first care ha been to keep the matter secret--
you knew noth of me or my famili and therefor
there could be no occas for ever mention my name
to you; and as he wa alway particularli afraid of hi
sister suspect ani thing that wa reason enough
for hi not mention it

she wa silent--elinor secur sunk; but her
self-command did not sink with it

four year you have been engag said she
with a firm voic

yes; and heaven know how much longer we may have
to wait poor edward! it put him quit out of heart
then take a small miniatur from her pocket she ad
to prevent the possibl of mistak be so good as to look
at thi face it doe not do him justic to be sure
but yet i think you cannot be deceiv as to the person
it wa drew for--i have had it abov these three year

she put it into her hand as she spoke; and when elinor
saw the paint whatev other doubt her fear of a
too hasti decis or her wish of detect falsehood
might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of
it be edward face she return it almost instantli
acknowledg the like

i have never been abl continu luci to give
him my pictur in return which i am veri much vex at
for he ha been alway so anxiou to get it! but i am
determin to set for it the veri first opportun

you are quit in the right repli elinor calmli
they then proceed a few pace in silenc luci spoke first

i am sure said she i have no doubt in the world
of your faith keep thi secret becaus you must
know of what import it is to us not to have it reach
hi mother; for she would never approv of it i dare say
i shall have no fortun and i fanci she is an exceed
proud woman

i certainli did not seek your confid said elinor;
but you do me no more than justic in imagin that i
may be depend on your secret is safe with me;
but pardon me if i express some surpris at so unnecessari
a commun you must at least have felt that my
be acquaint with it could not add to it safeti

as she said thi she look earnestli at luci
hope to discov someth in her countenance; perhap the
falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;
but luci counten suffer no chang

i wa afraid you would think i wa take a great
liberti with you said she in tell you all thi
i have not known you long to be sure person at least
but i have known you and all your famili by descript
a great while; and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if
you wa an old acquaint besid in the present case
i realli thought some explan wa due to you after my
make such particular inquiri about edward mother;
and i am so unfortun that i have not a creatur whose
advic i can ask ann is the onli person that know of it
and she ha no judgment at all; inde she doe me a great
deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her
betray me she doe not know how to hold her tongu
as you must perceiv and i am sure i wa in the greatest
fright in the world tother day when edward name wa
mention by sir john lest she should out with it all
you cant think how much i go through in my mind from
it altogeth i onli wonder that i am aliv after what
i have suffer for edward sake these last four year
everi thing in such suspens and uncertainty; and see
him so seldom--w can hardli meet abov twice a-year
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quit broke

here she took out her handkerchief; but elinor did
not feel veri compassion

sometim continu luci after wipe her eye
i think whether it would not be better for us both
to break off the matter entir as she said thi
she look directli at her companion but then
at other time i have not resolut enough for it--
i cannot bear the thought of make him so miser
as i know the veri mention of such a thing would do
and on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--i dont
think i could be equal to it what would you advis
me to do in such a case miss dashwood? what would you
do yourself?

pardon me repli elinor startl by the question;
but i can give you no advic under such circumst
your own judgment must direct you

to be sure continu luci after a few minut
silenc on both side hi mother must provid for him
sometim or other; but poor edward is so cast down by it!
did you not think him dread low-spirit when he wa at
barton? he wa so miser when he left us at longstapl
to go to you that i wa afraid you would think him quit ill

did he come from your uncl then when he visit us?

oh yes; he had been stay a fortnight with us
did you think he came directli from town?

no repli elinor most feelingli sensibl of
everi fresh circumst in favour of luci veracity;
i rememb he told us that he had been stay
a fortnight with some friend near plymouth
she rememb too her own surpris at the time
at hi mention noth farther of those friend
at hi total silenc with respect even to their name

did not you think him sadli out of spirits?
repeat luci

we did inde particularli so when he first arriv

i beg him to exert himself for fear you
should suspect what wa the matter; but it made him
so melancholi not be abl to stay more than a
fortnight with us and see me so much affected--
poor fellow!--i am afraid it is just the same with him now;
for he write in wretch spirit i heard from him just
befor i left exeter; take a letter from her pocket
and carelessli show the direct to elinor
you know hi hand i dare say a charm one it is;
but that is not written so well as usual--h wa tire
i dare say for he had just fill the sheet to me as full
as possibl

elinor saw that it wa hi hand and she could doubt
no longer thi pictur she had allow herself to believ
might have been accident obtained; it might not have
been edward gift; but a correspond between them
by letter could subsist onli under a posit engag
could be authoris by noth else; for a few moment she
wa almost overcome--h heart sunk within her and she could
hardli stand; but exert wa indispens necessary;
and she struggl so resolut against the oppress
of her feel that her success wa speedi and for
the time complet

write to each other said luci return the
letter into her pocket is the onli comfort we have
in such long separ ye i have one other comfort
in hi pictur but poor edward ha not even that
if he had but my pictur he say he should be easi
i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he wa at
longstapl last and that wa some comfort to him he said
but not equal to a pictur perhap you might notic
the ring when you saw him?

i did said elinor with a composur of voic
under which wa conceal an emot and distress beyond
ani thing she had ever felt befor she wa mortifi
shock confound

fortun for her they had now reach the cottag
and the convers could be continu no farther
after sit with them a few minut the miss steel
return to the park and elinor wa then at liberti
to think and be wretch

chapter 23


howev small elinor gener depend on
luci verac might be it wa imposs for her
on seriou reflect to suspect it in the present case
where no temptat could be answer to the folli
of invent a falsehood of such a descript what luci
had assert to be true therefor elinor could not
dare not longer doubt; support as it wa too on everi
side by such probabl and proof and contradict
by noth but her own wish their opportun of
acquaint in the hous of mr pratt wa a foundat
for the rest at onc indisput and alarming; and edward
visit near plymouth hi melancholi state of mind
hi dissatisfact at hi own prospect hi uncertain
behaviour toward herself the intim knowledg of the
miss steel as to norland and their famili connect
which had often surpris her the pictur the letter
the ring form altogeth such a bodi of evid
as overcam everi fear of condemn him unfairli
and establish as a fact which no partial could
set asid hi ill-treat of herself--h resent
of such behaviour her indign at have been it dupe
for a short time made her feel onli for herself;
but other idea other consider soon aros
had edward been intent deceiv her? had he feign
a regard for her which he did not feel? wa hi engag
to luci an engag of the heart? no; whatev it might
onc have been she could not believ it such at present
hi affect wa all her own she could not be deceiv
in that her mother sister fanni all had been
consciou of hi regard for her at norland; it wa not
an illus of her own vaniti he certainli love her
what a soften of the heart wa thi persuasion! how much
could it not tempt her to forgive! he had been blamabl
highli blamabl in remain at norland after he first
felt her influenc over him to be more than it ought
to be in that he could not be defended; but if he
had injur her how much more had he injur himself;
if her case were pitiabl hi wa hopeless
hi imprud had made her miser for a while; but it
seem to have depriv himself of all chanc of ever
be otherwis she might in time regain tranquillity;
but he what had he to look forward to? could he
ever be toler happi with luci steele; could he
were hi affect for herself out of the question
with hi integr hi delicaci and well-inform mind
be satisfi with a wife like her--illiter art
and selfish?

the youth infatu of nineteen would natur
blind him to everi thing but her beauti and good nature;
but the four succeed years--year which if ration
spent give such improv to the understand must
have open hi eye to her defect of educ
while the same period of time spent on her side
in inferior societi and more frivol pursuit
had perhap rob her of that simplic which might
onc have given an interest charact to her beauti

if in the supposit of hi seek to marri herself
hi difficulti from hi mother had seem great
how much greater were they now like to be when
the object of hi engag wa undoubtedli inferior
in connect and probabl inferior in fortun to herself
these difficulti inde with a heart so alien
from luci might not press veri hard upon hi patience;
but melancholi wa the state of the person by whom the
expect of famili opposit and unkind could
be felt as a relief!

as these consider occur to her in pain
success she wept for him more than for herself
support by the convict of have done noth to
merit her present unhappi and consol by the belief
that edward had done noth to forfeit her esteem
she thought she could even now under the first smart
of the heavi blow command herself enough to guard everi
suspicion of the truth from her mother and sister
and so well wa she abl to answer her own expect
that when she join them at dinner onli two hour
after she had first suffer the extinct of all her
dearest hope no one would have suppos from the
appear of the sister that elinor wa mourn
in secret over obstacl which must divid her for ever
from the object of her love and that mariann wa
intern dwell on the perfect of a man of whose
whole heart she felt thoroughli possess and whom she
expect to see in everi carriag which drove near their hous

the necess of conceal from her mother and
mariann what had been entrust in confid to herself
though it oblig her to unceas exert wa no
aggrav of elinor distress on the contrari
it wa a relief to her to be spare the commun
of what would give such afflict to them and to be
save likewis from hear that condemn of edward
which would probabl flow from the excess of their partial
affect for herself and which wa more than she felt
equal to support

from their counsel or their convers she knew
she could receiv no assist their tender and
sorrow must add to her distress while her self-command
would neither receiv encourag from their exampl
nor from their prais she wa stronger alon
and her own good sens so well support her that her
firm wa as unshaken her appear of cheer
as invari as with regret so poignant and so fresh
it wa possibl for them to be

much as she had suffer from her first convers
with luci on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish
of renew it; and thi for more reason than one
she want to hear mani particular of their engag
repeat again she want more clearli to understand
what luci realli felt for edward whether there were ani
sincer in her declar of tender regard for him
and she particularli want to convinc luci by her
readi to enter on the matter again and her calm
in convers on it that she wa no otherwis interest
in it than as a friend which she veri much fear
her involuntari agit in their morn discours
must have left at least doubt that luci wa dispos
to be jealou of her appear veri probable: it wa plain
that edward had alway spoken highli in her prais
not mere from luci assert but from her ventur
to trust her on so short a person acquaint
with a secret so confessedli and evid import
and even sir john joke intellig must have had
some weight but inde while elinor remain so well
assur within herself of be realli belov by edward
it requir no other consider of probabl
to make it natur that luci should be jealous;
and that she wa so her veri confid wa a proof
what other reason for the disclosur of the affair could
there be but that elinor might be inform by it of luci
superior claim on edward and be taught to avoid him
in future? she had littl difficulti in understand thu
much of her rival intent and while she wa firmli
resolv to act by her as everi principl of honour and
honesti direct to combat her own affect for edward
and to see him as littl as possible; she could not deni
herself the comfort of endeavour to convinc luci
that her heart wa unwound and as she could now have
noth more pain to hear on the subject than had alreadi
been told she did not mistrust her own abil of go
through a repetit of particular with composur

but it wa not immedi that an opportun
of do so could be command though luci wa as well
dispos as herself to take advantag of ani that occurred;
for the weather wa not often fine enough to allow
of their join in a walk where they might most easili
separ themselv from the others; and though they
met at least everi other even either at the park
or cottag and chiefli at the former they could
not be suppos to meet for the sake of convers
such a thought would never enter either sir john or ladi
middleton head; and therefor veri littl leisur
wa ever given for a gener chat and none at all for
particular discours they met for the sake of eat
drink and laugh togeth play at card
or consequ or ani other game that wa suffici noisi

one or two meet of thi kind had taken place
without afford elinor ani chanc of engag luci
in privat when sir john call at the cottag one morn
to beg in the name of chariti that they would all
dine with ladi middleton that day as he wa oblig
to attend the club at exet and she would otherwis be
quit alon except her mother and the two miss steel
elinor who foresaw a fairer open for the point she
had in view in such a parti as thi wa like to be
more at liberti among themselv under the tranquil
and well-br direct of ladi middleton than when
her husband unit them togeth in one noisi purpos
immedi accept the invitation; margaret with her
mother permiss wa equal compliant and mariann
though alway unwil to join ani of their parti
wa persuad by her mother who could not bear to have her
seclud herself from ani chanc of amus to go likewis

the young ladi went and ladi middleton wa happili
preserv from the fright solitud which had threaten her
the insipid of the meet wa exactli such as elinor
had expected; it produc not one novelti of thought
or express and noth could be less interest
than the whole of their discours both in the dine
parlour and draw room: to the latter the children
accompani them and while they remain there she wa
too well convinc of the imposs of engag luci
attent to attempt it they quit it onli with the
remov of the tea-th the card-tabl wa then place
and elinor began to wonder at herself for have ever
entertain a hope of find time for convers
at the park they all rose up in prepar for a round game

i am glad said ladi middleton to luci
you are not go to finish poor littl annamaria
basket thi evening; for i am sure it must hurt your
eye to work filigre by candlelight and we will make
the dear littl love some amend for her disappoint
to-morrow and then i hope she will not much mind it

thi hint wa enough luci recollect herself instantli
and repli inde you are veri much mistaken
ladi middleton; i am onli wait to know whether you can
make your parti without me or i should have been at my
filigre alreadi i would not disappoint the littl angel
for all the world: and if you want me at the card-tabl now
i am resolv to finish the basket after supper

you are veri good i hope it wont hurt your eyes--
will you ring the bell for some work candles?
my poor littl girl would be sadli disappoint i know
if the basket wa not finish tomorrow for though i
told her it certainli would not i am sure she depend
upon have it done

luci directli drew her work tabl near her
and reseat herself with an alacr and cheer
which seem to infer that she could tast no greater
delight than in make a filigre basket for a spoilt child

ladi middleton propos a rubber of casino to the other
no one made ani object but mariann who with her usual
inattent to the form of gener civil exclaim
your ladyship will have the good to excus me--you
know i detest card i shall go to the piano-forte;
i have not touch it sinc it wa tune and without
farther ceremoni she turn away and walk to the instrument

ladi middleton look as if she thank heaven
that she had never made so rude a speech

mariann can never keep long from that instrument
you know maam said elinor endeavour to smooth
away the offence; and i do not much wonder at it; for it
is the veri best tone piano-fort i ever heard

the remain five were now to draw their card

perhap continu elinor if i should happen
to cut out i may be of some use to miss luci steel
in roll her paper for her; and there is so much still
to be done to the basket that it must be imposs
i think for her labour singli to finish it thi even
i should like the work exceedingli if she would allow
me a share in it

inde i shall be veri much oblig to you
for your help cri luci for i find there is more
to be done to it than i thought there was; and it would
be a shock thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all

oh! that would be terribl inde said miss steele--
dear littl soul how i do love her!

you are veri kind said ladi middleton to elinor;
and as you realli like the work perhap you will be
as well pleas not to cut in till anoth rubber
or will you take your chanc now?

elinor joy profit by the first of these propos
and thu by a littl of that address which mariann
could never condescend to practis gain her own end
and pleas ladi middleton at the same time luci made room
for her with readi attent and the two fair rival were
thu seat side by side at the same tabl and with the
utmost harmoni engag in forward the same work
the pianofort at which mariann wrap up in her own
music and her own thought had by thi time forgotten
that ani bodi wa in the room besid herself wa luckili
so near them that miss dashwood now judg she might safe
under the shelter of it nois introduc the interest
subject without ani risk of be heard at the card-tabl



chapter 24


in a firm though cautiou tone elinor thu began

i should be undeserv of the confid you have
honour me with if i felt no desir for it continu
or no farther curios on it subject i will
not apolog therefor for bring it forward again

thank you cri luci warmli for break
the ice; you have set my heart at eas by it; for i wa
somehow or other afraid i had offend you by what i
told you that monday

offend me! how could you suppos so? believ me
and elinor spoke it with the truest sincer
noth could be farther from my intent than to give
you such an idea could you have a motiv for the trust
that wa not honour and flatter to me?

and yet i do assur you repli luci her littl
sharp eye full of mean there seem to me to be
a cold and displeasur in your manner that made me
quit uncomfort i felt sure that you wa angri with me;
and have been quarrel with myself ever sinc for have
took such a liberti as to troubl you with my affair
but i am veri glad to find it wa onli my own fanci
and that you realli do not blame me if you knew what a
consol it wa to me to reliev my heart speak to you
of what i am alway think of everi moment of my life
your compass would make you overlook everi thing els
i am sure

inde i can easili believ that it wa a veri great
relief to you to acknowledg your situat to me and be
assur that you shall never have reason to repent it
your case is a veri unfortun one; you seem to me to
be surround with difficulti and you will have need
of all your mutual affect to support you under them
mr ferrar i believ is entir depend on hi mother

he ha onli two thousand pound of hi own; it would
be mad to marri upon that though for my own part
i could give up everi prospect of more without a sigh
i have been alway use to a veri small incom and could
struggl with ani poverti for him; but i love him too well
to be the selfish mean of rob him perhap of all that
hi mother might give him if he marri to pleas her
we must wait it may be for mani year with almost everi
other man in the world it would be an alarm prospect;
but edward affect and constanc noth can depriv me of
i know

that convict must be everi thing to you;
and he is undoubtedli support by the same trust in your
if the strength of your reciproc attach had fail
as between mani peopl and under mani circumst
it natur would dure a four year engag
your situat would have been pitiabl inde

luci here look up; but elinor wa care
in guard her counten from everi express
that could give her word a suspici tendenc

edward love for me said luci ha been pretti
well put to the test by our long veri long absenc
sinc we were first engag and it ha stood the trial
so well that i should be unpardon to doubt it now
i can safe say that he ha never gave me one moment
alarm on that account from the first

elinor hardli knew whether to smile or sigh
at thi assert

luci went on i am rather of a jealou temper too
by natur and from our differ situat in life
from hi be so much more in the world than me and our
continu separ i wa enough inclin for suspicion
to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been
the slightest alter in hi behaviour to me when we met
or ani low of spirit that i could not account for
or if he had talk more of one ladi than anoth
or seem in ani respect less happi at longstapl than he
use to be i do not mean to say that i am particularli
observ or quick-sight in gener but in such a case
i am sure i could not be deceiv

all thi thought elinor is veri pretty;
but it can impos upon neither of us

but what said she after a short silenc
are your views? or have you none but that of wait for
mr ferrarss death which is a melancholi and shock
extremity?--i her son determin to submit to thi
and to all the tedious of the mani year of suspens
in which it may involv you rather than run the risk
of her displeasur for a while by own the truth?

if we could be certain that it would be onli
for a while! but mr ferrar is a veri headstrong
proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hear
it would veri like secur everi thing to robert
and the idea of that for edward sake frighten away
all my inclin for hasti measur

and for your own sake too or you are carri
your disinterested beyond reason

luci look at elinor again and wa silent

do you know mr robert ferrars? ask elinor

not at all--i never saw him; but i fanci he
is veri unlik hi brother--silli and a great coxcomb

a great coxcomb! repeat miss steel whose ear had
caught those word by a sudden paus in mariann music--
oh they are talk of their favourit beaux i dare say

no sister cri luci you are mistaken there our
favourit beaux are not great coxcomb

i can answer for it that miss dashwood is not
said mr jen laugh heartily; for he is one
of the modestest prettiest behav young men i ever saw;
but as for luci she is such a sli littl creatur
there is no find out who she like

oh cri miss steel look significantli round
at them i dare say luci beau is quit as modest
and pretti behav as miss dashwood

elinor blush in spite of herself luci bit her lip
and look angrili at her sister a mutual silenc took
place for some time luci first put an end to it by say
in a lower tone though mariann wa then give them
the power protect of a veri magnific concerto--

i will honestli tell you of one scheme which ha
late come into my head for bring matter to bear;
inde i am bound to let you into the secret for you
are a parti concern i dare say you have seen enough
of edward to know that he would prefer the church to everi
other profession; now my plan is that he should take
order as soon as he can and then through your interest
which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of
friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me
your brother might be persuad to give him norland living;
which i understand is a veri good one and the present
incumb not like to live a great while that would
be enough for us to marri upon and we might trust to time
and chanc for the rest

i should alway be happi repli elinor to show
ani mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars;
but do you not perceiv that my interest on such an
occas would be perfectli unnecessary? he is brother
to mr john dashwood--that must be recommend enough
to her husband

but mr john dashwood would not much approv
of edward go into order

then i rather suspect that my interest would
do veri littl

they were again silent for mani minut at length
luci exclaim with a deep sigh

i believ it would be the wisest way to put an end
to the busi at onc by dissolv the engag
we seem so beset with difficulti on everi side
that though it would make us miser for a time
we should be happier perhap in the end but you will
not give me your advic miss dashwood?

no answer elinor with a smile which conceal
veri agit feel on such a subject i certainli
will not you know veri well that my opinion would have
no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wish

inde you wrong me repli luci with great
solemnity; i know nobodi of whose judgment i think
so highli as i do of yours; and i do realli believ
that if you wa to say to me i advis you by all mean
to put an end to your engag with edward ferrar
it will be more for the happi of both of you
i should resolv upon do it immedi

elinor blush for the insincer of edward
futur wife and repli thi compliment would effectu
frighten me from give ani opinion on the subject
had i form one it rais my influenc much too high;
the power of divid two peopl so tenderli attach
is too much for an indiffer person

ti becaus you are an indiffer person said luci
with some piqu and lay a particular stress on those word
that your judgment might justli have such weight with me
if you could be suppos to be bias in ani respect
by your own feel your opinion would not be worth have

elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to thi
lest they might provok each other to an unsuit increas
of eas and unreserve; and wa even partli determin
never to mention the subject again anoth paus
therefor of mani minut durat succeed thi speech
and luci wa still the first to end it

shall you be in town thi winter miss dashwood?
said she with all her accustomari complac

certainli not

i am sorri for that return the other
while her eye brighten at the inform
it would have gave me such pleasur to meet you there!
but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure
your brother and sister will ask you to come to them

it will not be in my power to accept their invit
if they do

how unlucki that is! i had quit depend upon
meet you there ann and me are to go the latter end
of januari to some relat who have been want us to
visit them these sever years! but i onli go for the sake
of see edward he will be there in februari otherwis
london would have no charm for me; i have not spirit for it

elinor wa soon call to the card-tabl by the
conclus of the first rubber and the confidenti
discours of the two ladi wa therefor at an end
to which both of them submit without ani reluct
for noth had been said on either side to make them
dislik each other less than they had done before;
and elinor sat down to the card tabl with the melancholi
persuas that edward wa not onli without affect
for the person who wa to be hi wife; but that he had
not even the chanc of be toler happi in marriag
which sincer affect on her side would have given
for self-interest alon could induc a woman to keep a man
to an engag of which she seem so thoroughli awar
that he wa weari

from thi time the subject wa never reviv by elinor
and when enter on by luci who seldom miss an opportun
of introduc it and wa particularli care to inform
her confidant of her happi whenev she receiv a letter
from edward it wa treat by the former with calm
and caution and dismiss as soon as civil would allow;
for she felt such convers to be an indulg which
luci did not deserv and which were danger to herself

the visit of the miss steel at barton park wa
lengthen far beyond what the first invit impli
their favour increased; they could not be spared;
sir john would not hear of their going; and in spite
of their numer and long arrang engag in exet
in spite of the absolut necess of return to fulfil
them immedi which wa in full forc at the end
of everi week they were prevail on to stay nearli two
month at the park and to assist in the due celebr
of that festiv which requir a more than ordinari
share of privat ball and larg dinner to proclaim
it import



chapter 25


though mr jen wa in the habit of spend a larg
portion of the year at the hous of her children and friend
she wa not without a settl habit of her own
sinc the death of her husband who had trade with success
in a less eleg part of the town she had resid everi
winter in a hous in one of the street near portman squar
toward thi home she began on the approach of januari
to turn her thought and thither she one day abruptli
and veri unexpectedli by them ask the elder miss
dashwood to accompani her elinor without observ
the vari complexion of her sister and the anim look
which spoke no indiffer to the plan immedi gave
a grate but absolut denial for both in which she
believ herself to be speak their unit inclin
the reason alleg wa their determin resolut
of not leav their mother at that time of the year
mr jen receiv the refus with some surpris
and repeat her invit immedi

oh lord! i am sure your mother can spare you
veri well and i do beg you will favour me with
your compani for ive quit set my heart upon it
dont fanci that you will be ani inconveni to me
for i shant put myself at all out of my way for you
it will onli be send betti by the coach and i
hope i can afford that we three shall be abl to go
veri well in my chaise; and when we are in town
if you do not like to go wherev i do well and good
you may alway go with one of my daughter i am sure
your mother will not object to it; for i have had such
good luck in get my own children off my hand that she
will think me a veri fit person to have the charg of you;
and if i dont get one of you at least well marri
befor i have done with you it shall not be my fault
i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men
you may depend upon it

i have a notion said sir john that miss mariann
would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister
would come into it it is veri hard inde that she
should not have a littl pleasur becaus miss dashwood
doe not wish it so i would advis you two to set off
for town when you are tire of barton without say
a word to miss dashwood about it

nay cri mr jen i am sure i shall be
monstrou glad of miss mariann compani whether miss
dashwood will go or not onli the more the merrier say i
and i thought it would be more comfort for them to
be together; becaus if they got tire of me they might talk
to one anoth and laugh at my old way behind my back
but one or the other if not both of them i must have
lord bless me! how do you think i can live poke by myself
i who have been alway use till thi winter to have
charlott with me come miss mariann let us strike
hand upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will chang
her mind by and bye whi so much the better

i thank you maam sincer thank you said mariann
with warmth: your invit ha insur my gratitud for ever
and it would give me such happi ye almost the greatest
happi i am capabl of to be abl to accept it
but my mother my dearest kindest mother--i feel the
justic of what elinor ha urg and if she were to be
made less happi less comfort by our absence--oh! no
noth should tempt me to leav her it should not
must not be a struggl

mr jen repeat her assur that mr dashwood
could spare them perfectli well; and elinor who now
understood her sister and saw to what indiffer to
almost everi thing els she wa carri by her eager
to be with willoughbi again made no farther direct
opposit to the plan and mere refer it to her
mother decis from whom howev she scarc expect
to receiv ani support in her endeavour to prevent a visit
which she could not approv of for mariann and which
on her own account she had particular reason to avoid
whatev mariann wa desir of her mother would be eager
to promote--sh could not expect to influenc the latter
to cautious of conduct in an affair respect which she
had never been abl to inspir her with distrust; and she
dare not explain the motiv of her own disinclin
for go to london that mariann fastidi as she wa
thoroughli acquaint with mr jen manner
and invari disgust by them should overlook everi
inconveni of that kind should disregard whatev
must be most wound to her irrit feel in her
pursuit of one object wa such a proof so strong
so full of the import of that object to her as elinor
in spite of all that had pass wa not prepar to wit

on be inform of the invit mr dashwood
persuad that such an excurs would be product
of much amus to both her daughter and perceiv
through all her affection attent to herself
how much the heart of mariann wa in it would not hear
of their declin the offer upon her account; insist on
their both accept it directly; and then began to forese
with her usual cheer a varieti of advantag that
would accru to them all from thi separ

i am delight with the plan she cri
it is exactli what i could wish margaret and i shall
be as much benefit by it as yourselv when you
and the middleton are gone we shall go on so quietli
and happili togeth with our book and our music! you
will find margaret so improv when you come back again!
i have a littl plan of alter for your bedroom too
which may now be perform without ani inconveni
to ani one it is veri right that you should go to town;
i would have everi young woman of your condit in life
acquaint with the manner and amus of london
you will be under the care of a motherli good sort
of woman of whose kind to you i can have no doubt
and in all probabl you will see your brother
and whatev may be hi fault or the fault of hi wife
when i consid whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so
wholli estrang from each other

though with your usual anxieti for our happi
said elinor you have been obviat everi impedi
to the present scheme which occur to you there is
still one object which in my opinion cannot be so
easili remov

mariann counten sunk

and what said mr dashwood is my dear prudent
elinor go to suggest? what formid obstacl is she
now to bring forward? do let me hear a word about the
expens of it

my object is this; though i think veri well of
mr jenningss heart she is not a woman whose societi
can afford us pleasur or whose protect will give
us consequ

that is veri true repli her mother but of
her societi separ from that of other peopl
you will scarc have ani thing at all and you will
almost alway appear in public with ladi middleton

if elinor is frighten away by her dislik of
mr jen said mariann at least it need not prevent
my accept her invit i have no such scrupl
and i am sure i could put up with everi unpleas
of that kind with veri littl effort

elinor could not help smile at thi display of
indiffer toward the manner of a person to whom she
had often had difficulti in persuad mariann to behav
with toler politeness; and resolv within herself
that if her sister persist in go she would
go likewis as she did not think it proper that mariann
should be left to the sole guidanc of her own judgment
or that mr jen should be abandon to the merci
of mariann for all the comfort of her domest hour
to thi determin she wa the more easili reconcil
by recollect that edward ferrar by luci account
wa not to be in town befor february; and that
their visit without ani unreason abridg
might be previous finish

i will have you both go said mr dashwood;
these object are nonsens you will have much
pleasur in be in london and especi in be together;
and if elinor would ever condescend to anticip enjoy
she would forese it there from a varieti of sources;
she would perhap expect some from improv her
acquaint with her sister-in-law famili

elinor had often wish for an opportun of
attempt to weaken her mother depend on the
attach of edward and herself that the shock might
be less when the whole truth were reveal and now
on thi attack though almost hopeless of success
she forc herself to begin her design by say
as calmli as she could i like edward ferrar veri much
and shall alway be glad to see him; but as to the rest
of the famili it is a matter of perfect indiffer
to me whether i am ever known to them or not

mr dashwood smile and said noth
mariann lift up her eye in astonish and elinor
conjectur that she might as well have held her tongu

after veri littl farther discours it wa final
settl that the invit should be fulli accept
mr jen receiv the inform with a great
deal of joy and mani assur of kind and care;
nor wa it a matter of pleasur mere to her sir john
wa delighted; for to a man whose prevail anxieti
wa the dread of be alon the acquisit of two
to the number of inhabit in london wa someth
even ladi middleton took the troubl of be delight
which wa put herself rather out of her way;
and as for the miss steel especi luci they had
never been so happi in their live as thi intellig
made them

elinor submit to the arrang which counteract
her wish with less reluct than she had expect
to feel with regard to herself it wa now a matter
of unconcern whether she went to town or not and when
she saw her mother so thoroughli pleas with the plan
and her sister exhilar by it in look voic and manner
restor to all her usual anim and elev to more
than her usual gaieti she could not be dissatisfi
with the caus and would hardli allow herself to distrust
the consequ

mariann joy wa almost a degre beyond happi
so great wa the perturb of her spirit and her
impati to be gone her unwilling to quit her
mother wa her onli restor to calmness; and at the
moment of part her grief on that score wa excess
her mother afflict wa hardli less and elinor
wa the onli one of the three who seem to consid
the separ as ani thing short of etern

their departur took place in the first week in januari
the middleton were to follow in about a week the miss
steel kept their station at the park and were to quit
it onli with the rest of the famili



chapter 26


elinor could not find herself in the carriag with mr jen
and begin a journey to london under her protect
and as her guest without wonder at her own situat
so short had their acquaint with that ladi been
so wholli unsuit were they in age and disposit
and so mani had been her object against such a measur
onli a few day before! but these object had all
with that happi ardour of youth which mariann and her mother
equal share been overcom or overlooked; and elinor
in spite of everi occasion doubt of willoughbi constanc
could not wit the raptur of delight expect
which fill the whole soul and beam in the eye
of mariann without feel how blank wa her own prospect
how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison
and how gladli she would engag in the solicitud of
mariann situat to have the same anim object
in view the same possibl of hope a short a veri
short time howev must now decid what willoughbi
intent were; in all probabl he wa alreadi in town
mariann eager to be gone declar her depend
on find him there; and elinor wa resolv not onli upon
gain everi new light as to hi charact which her
own observ or the intellig of other could give her
but likewis upon watch hi behaviour to her sister
with such zealou attent as to ascertain what he wa
and what he meant befor mani meet had taken place
should the result of her observ be unfavour
she wa determin at all event to open the eye
of her sister; should it be otherwis her exert
would be of a differ nature--sh must then learn
to avoid everi selfish comparison and banish everi regret
which might lessen her satisfact in the happi of mariann

they were three day on their journey and mariann
behaviour as they travel wa a happi specimen of what
futur complais and companion to mr jen
might be expect to be she sat in silenc almost all
the way wrapt in her own medit and scarc ever
voluntarili speak except when ani object of picturesqu
beauti within their view drew from her an exclam
of delight exclus address to her sister to aton
for thi conduct therefor elinor took immedi possess
of the post of civil which she had assign herself
behav with the greatest attent to mr jen
talk with her laugh with her and listen to her
whenev she could; and mr jen on her side
treat them both with all possibl kind wa solicit
on everi occas for their eas and enjoy and onli
disturb that she could not make them choos their own
dinner at the inn nor extort a confess of their
prefer salmon to cod or boil fowl to veal cutlet
they reach town by three oclock the third day glad to
be releas after such a journey from the confin
of a carriag and readi to enjoy all the luxuri of a good fire

the hous wa handsom and handsom fit up
and the young ladi were immedi put in possess
of a veri comfort apart it had formerli
been charlott and over the mantelpiec still hung
a landscap in colour silk of her perform
in proof of her have spent seven year at a great school
in town to some effect

as dinner wa not to be readi in less than two
hour from their arriv elinor determin to employ
the interv in write to her mother and sat down for
that purpos in a few moment mariann did the same
i am write home mariann said elinor; had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?

i am not go to write to my mother
repli mariann hastili and as if wish to avoid
ani farther inquiri elinor said no more; it immedi
struck her that she must then be write to willoughby;
and the conclus which as instantli follow wa
that howev mysteri they might wish to conduct
the affair they must be engag thi convict
though not entir satisfactori gave her pleasur
and she continu her letter with greater alacr
mariann wa finish in a veri few minutes;
in length it could be no more than a note; it wa then
fold up seal and direct with eager rapid
elinor thought she could distinguish a larg w in
the direction; and no sooner wa it complet than mariann
ring the bell request the footman who answer it
to get that letter convey for her to the two-penni post
thi decid the matter at onc

her spirit still continu veri high; but there
wa a flutter in them which prevent their give much
pleasur to her sister and thi agit increas as
the even drew on she could scarc eat ani dinner
and when they afterward return to the draw room
seem anxious listen to the sound of everi carriag

it wa a great satisfact to elinor that mr jen
by be much engag in her own room could see littl
of what wa pass the tea thing were brought in
and alreadi had mariann been disappoint more than onc
by a rap at a neighbour door when a loud one wa suddenli
heard which could not be mistaken for one at ani other hous
elinor felt secur of it announc willoughbi approach
and mariann start up move toward the door
everi thing wa silent; thi could not be born mani seconds;
she open the door advanc a few step toward the stair
and after listen half a minut return into the room
in all the agit which a convict of have heard
him would natur produce; in the ecstasi of her
feel at that instant she could not help exclaim
oh elinor it is willoughbi inde it is! and seem
almost readi to throw herself into hi arm when colonel
brandon appear

it wa too great a shock to be born with calm
and she immedi left the room elinor wa disappoint too;
but at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensur
hi welcom with her; and she felt particularli hurt that
a man so partial to her sister should perceiv that she
experienc noth but grief and disappoint in see him
she instantli saw that it wa not unnot by him
that he even observ mariann as she quit the room
with such astonish and concern as hardli left him
the recollect of what civil demand toward herself

is your sister ill? said he

elinor answer in some distress that she wa
and then talk of head-ach low spirit and over fatigues;
and of everi thing to which she could decent attribut
her sister behaviour

he heard her with the most earnest attent
but seem to recollect himself said no more on the subject
and began directli to speak of hi pleasur at see them
in london make the usual inquiri about their journey
and the friend they had left behind

in thi calm kind of way with veri littl interest
on either side they continu to talk both of them out
of spirit and the thought of both engag elsewher
elinor wish veri much to ask whether willoughbi were
then in town but she wa afraid of give him pain
by ani enquiri after hi rival; and at length by way
of say someth she ask if he had been in london
ever sinc she had seen him last ye he repli
with some embarrass almost ever since; i have been
onc or twice at delaford for a few day but it ha never
been in my power to return to barton

thi and the manner in which it wa said
immedi brought back to her remembr all the
circumst of hi quit that place with the
uneasi and suspicion they had caus to mr jen
and she wa fear that her question had impli
much more curios on the subject than she had ever felt

mr jen soon came in oh! colonel said she
with her usual noisi cheer i am monstrou glad
to see you--sorri i could not come before--beg your
pardon but i have been forc to look about me a littl
and settl my matters; for it is a long while sinc i
have been at home and you know one ha alway a world
of littl odd thing to do after one ha been away for
ani time; and then i have had cartwright to settl with--
lord i have been as busi as a bee ever sinc dinner!
but pray colonel how came you to conjur out that i should
be in town today?

i had the pleasur of hear it at mr palmer
where i have been dine

oh you did; well and how do they all do at their
house? how doe charlott do? i warrant you she is a fine
size by thi time

mr palmer appear quit well and i am commiss
to tell you that you will certainli see her to-morrow

ay to be sure i thought as much well colonel
i have brought two young ladi with me you see--that is
you see but one of them now but there is anoth somewher
your friend miss mariann too--which you will not be
sorri to hear i do not know what you and mr willoughbi
will do between you about her ay it is a fine thing
to be young and handsom well! i wa young onc but i
never wa veri handsome--wors luck for me howev i got
a veri good husband and i dont know what the greatest
beauti can do more ah! poor man! he ha been dead
these eight year and better but colonel where have
you been to sinc we parted? and how doe your busi
go on? come come let have no secret among friend

he repli with hi accustomari mild to all
her inquiri but without satisfi her in ani
elinor now began to make the tea and mariann wa
oblig to appear again

after her entranc colonel brandon becam
more thought and silent than he had been befor
and mr jen could not prevail on him to stay long
no other visitor appear that even and the ladi
were unanim in agre to go earli to bed

mariann rose the next morn with recov spirit
and happi look the disappoint of the even befor
seem forgotten in the expect of what wa to happen
that day they had not long finish their breakfast befor
mr palmer barouch stop at the door and in a few
minut she came laugh into the room: so delight
to see them all that it wa hard to say whether she
receiv most pleasur from meet her mother or the miss
dashwood again so surpris at their come to town
though it wa what she had rather expect all along;
so angri at their accept her mother invit
after have declin her own though at the same time
she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!

mr palmer will be so happi to see you
said she; what do you think he said when he heard
of your come with mamma? i forget what it wa now
but it wa someth so droll!

after an hour or two spent in what her mother call
comfort chat or in other word in everi varieti of inquiri
concern all their acquaint on mr jenningss side
and in laughter without caus on mr palmer it wa
propos by the latter that they should all accompani
her to some shop where she had busi that morn
to which mr jen and elinor readili consent
as have likewis some purchas to make themselves;
and mariann though declin it at first wa induc
to go likewis

wherev they went she wa evid alway on
the watch in bond street especi where much of
their busi lay her eye were in constant inquiry;
and in whatev shop the parti were engag her mind wa
equal abstract from everi thing actual befor them
from all that interest and occupi the other
restless and dissatisfi everi where her sister could
never obtain her opinion of ani articl of purchas
howev it might equal concern them both: she receiv
no pleasur from anything; wa onli impati to be at
home again and could with difficulti govern her vexat
at the tedious of mr palmer whose eye wa caught
by everi thing pretti expens or new; who wa wild
to buy all could determin on none and dawdl away her
time in raptur and indecis

it wa late in the morn befor they return home;
and no sooner had they enter the hous than mariann flew
eagerli up stair and when elinor follow she found
her turn from the tabl with a sorrow counten
which declar that no willoughbi had been there

ha no letter been left here for me sinc we went out?
said she to the footman who then enter with the parcel
she wa answer in the neg are you quit sure
of it? she repli are you certain that no servant
no porter ha left ani letter or note?

the man repli that none had

how veri odd! said she in a low and disappoint
voic as she turn away to the window

how odd indeed! repeat elinor within herself
regard her sister with uneasi if she had not
known him to be in town she would not have written to him
as she did; she would have written to comb magna;
and if he is in town how odd that he should neither
come nor write! oh! my dear mother you must be wrong
in permit an engag between a daughter so young
a man so littl known to be carri on in so doubt
so mysteri a manner! i long to inquire; and how will my
interfer be born

she determin after some consider that if
appear continu mani day longer as unpleas as they
now were she would repres in the strongest manner
to her mother the necess of some seriou enquiri into the
affair

mr palmer and two elderli ladi of mr jenningss
intim acquaint whom she had met and invit
in the morn dine with them the former left them
soon after tea to fulfil her even engagements;
and elinor wa oblig to assist in make a whist tabl
for the other mariann wa of no use on these occas
as she would never learn the game; but though her time
wa therefor at her own dispos the even wa by no
mean more product of pleasur to her than to elinor
for it wa spent in all the anxieti of expect and the
pain of disappoint she sometim endeavour for a
few minut to read; but the book wa soon thrown asid
and she return to the more interest employ
of walk backward and forward across the room
paus for a moment whenev she came to the window
in hope of distinguish the long-expect rap



chapter 27


if thi open weather hold much longer said mr jen
when they met at breakfast the follow morn
sir john will not like leav barton next week;
ti a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day pleasur
poor souls! i alway piti them when they do; they seem
to take it so much to heart

that is true cri mariann in a cheer voic
and walk to the window as she spoke to examin the day
i had not thought of that thi weather will keep mani
sportsmen in the countri

it wa a lucki recollect all her good spirit were
restor by it it is charm weather for them inde
she continu as she sat down to the breakfast tabl
with a happi counten how much they must enjoy
it! but (with a littl return of anxiety) it cannot
be expect to last long at thi time of the year
and after such a seri of rain we shall certainli
have veri littl more of it frost will soon set in
and in all probabl with sever in anoth day
or two perhaps; thi extrem mild can hardli last
longer--nay perhap it may freez tonight!

at ani rate said elinor wish to prevent
mr jen from see her sister thought as clearli
as she did i dare say we shall have sir john and ladi
middleton in town by the end of next week

ay my dear ill warrant you we do mari alway
ha her own way

and now silent conjectur elinor she will
write to comb by thi day post

but if she did the letter wa written and sent away
with a privaci which elud all her watch to ascertain
the fact whatev the truth of it might be and far
as elinor wa from feel thorough content about it
yet while she saw mariann in spirit she could not be
veri uncomfort herself and mariann wa in spirits;
happi in the mild of the weather and still happier
in her expect of a frost

the morn wa chiefli spent in leav card at
the hous of mr jenningss acquaint to inform
them of her be in town; and mariann wa all the time
busi in observ the direct of the wind watch the
variat of the sky and imagin an alter in the air

dont you find it colder than it wa in the morn
elinor? there seem to me a veri decid differ
i can hardli keep my hand warm even in my muff it wa
not so yesterday i think the cloud seem part too
the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a
clear afternoon

elinor wa altern divert and pained;
but mariann persev and saw everi night in the
bright of the fire and everi morn in the appear
of the atmospher the certain symptom of approach frost

the miss dashwood had no greater reason to be
dissatisfi with mr jenningss style of live and set
of acquaint than with her behaviour to themselv
which wa invari kind everi thing in her household
arrang wa conduct on the most liber plan
and except a few old citi friend whom to ladi
middleton regret she had never drop she visit
no one to whom an introduct could at all discompos
the feel of her young companion pleas to find
herself more comfort situat in that particular than
she had expect elinor wa veri will to compound
for the want of much real enjoy from ani of their
even parti which whether at home or abroad
form onli for card could have littl to amus her

colonel brandon who had a gener invit
to the hous wa with them almost everi day; he came
to look at mariann and talk to elinor who often deriv
more satisfact from convers with him than from ani
other daili occurr but who saw at the same time
with much concern hi continu regard for her sister
she fear it wa a strengthen regard it griev her
to see the earnest with which he often watch mariann
and hi spirit were certainli wors than when at barton

about a week after their arriv it becam
certain that willoughbi wa also arriv hi card
wa on the tabl when they came in from the morn drive

good god! cri mariann he ha been here while
we were out elinor rejoic to be assur of hi
be in london now ventur to say depend upon it
he will call again tomorrow but mariann seem
hardli to hear her and on mr jen entranc
escap with the preciou card

thi event while it rais the spirit of elinor
restor to those of her sister all and more than all
their former agit from thi moment her mind wa
never quiet; the expect of see him everi hour
of the day made her unfit for ani thing she insist
on be left behind the next morn when the other
went out

elinor thought were full of what might be pass
in berkeley street dure their absence; but a moment
glanc at her sister when they return wa enough to
inform her that willoughbi had paid no second visit there
a note wa just then brought in and laid on the tabl

for me! cri mariann step hastili forward

no maam for my mistress

but mariann not convinc took it instantli up

it is inde for mr jennings; how provoking!

you are expect a letter then? said elinor
unabl to be longer silent

ye a little--not much

after a short paus you have no confid
in me mariann

nay elinor thi reproach from you--you who have
confid in no one!

me! return elinor in some confusion; inde
mariann i have noth to tell

nor i answer mariann with energi our situat
then are alik we have neither of us ani thing to tell;
you becaus you do not commun and i becaus
i conceal noth

elinor distress by thi charg of reserv in herself
which she wa not at liberti to do away knew not how
under such circumst to press for greater open
in mariann

mr jen soon appear and the note be
given her she read it aloud it wa from ladi middleton
announc their arriv in conduit street the night befor
and request the compani of her mother and cousin
the follow even busi on sir john part
and a violent cold on her own prevent their call
in berkeley street the invit wa accepted;
but when the hour of appoint drew near necessari as
it wa in common civil to mr jen that they
should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some
difficulti in persuad her sister to go for still
she had seen noth of willoughby; and therefor wa
not more indispos for amus abroad than unwil
to run the risk of hi call again in her absenc

elinor found when the even wa over
that disposit is not materi alter by a chang
of abod for although scarc settl in town
sir john had contriv to collect around him nearli twenti
young peopl and to amus them with a ball thi wa
an affair howev of which ladi middleton did not approv
in the countri an unpremedit danc wa veri allowable;
but in london where the reput of eleg wa more
import and less easili attain it wa risk too much
for the gratif of a few girl to have it known that
ladi middleton had given a small danc of eight or nine coupl
with two violin and a mere side-board collat

mr and mr palmer were of the party; from the former
whom they had not seen befor sinc their arriv in town
as he wa care to avoid the appear of ani attent
to hi mother-in-law and therefor never came near her
they receiv no mark of recognit on their entranc
he look at them slightli without seem to know
who they were and mere nod to mr jen from
the other side of the room mariann gave one glanc
round the apart as she entered: it wa enough--h
wa not there--and she sat down equal ill-dispos
to receiv or commun pleasur after they had been
assembl about an hour mr palmer saunter toward
the miss dashwood to express hi surpris on see them
in town though colonel brandon had been first inform
of their arriv at hi hous and he had himself said
someth veri droll on hear that they were to come

i thought you were both in devonshir said he

did you? repli elinor

when do you go back again?

i do not know and thu end their discours

never had mariann been so unwil to danc
in her life as she wa that even and never so much
fatigu by the exercis she complain of it
as they return to berkeley street

aye aye said mr jen we know the reason
of all that veri well; if a certain person who shall
be nameless had been there you would not have been a
bit tired: and to say the truth it wa not veri pretti
of him not to give you the meet when he wa invit

invited! cri mariann

so my daughter middleton told me for it seem sir
john met him somewher in the street thi morn
mariann said no more but look exceedingli hurt
impati in thi situat to be do someth
that might lead to her sister relief elinor resolv
to write the next morn to her mother and hope
by awaken her fear for the health of mariann
to procur those inquiri which had been so long delayed;
and she wa still more eagerli bent on thi measur
by perceiv after breakfast on the morrow that mariann
wa again write to willoughbi for she could not suppos
it to be to ani other person

about the middl of the day mr jen went out by
herself on busi and elinor began her letter directli
while mariann too restless for employ too anxiou
for convers walk from one window to the other
or sat down by the fire in melancholi medit
elinor wa veri earnest in her applic to her mother
relat all that had pass her suspicion of
willoughbi inconst urg her by everi plea
of duti and affect to demand from mariann an account
of her real situat with respect to him

her letter wa scarc finish when a rap
foretold a visitor and colonel brandon wa announc
mariann who had seen him from the window and who hate
compani of ani kind left the room befor he enter it
he look more than usual grave and though express
satisfact at find miss dashwood alon as if he
had somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some
time without say a word elinor persuad that he
had some commun to make in which her sister
wa concern impati expect it open
it wa not the first time of her feel the same kind
of conviction; for more than onc befor begin with
the observ of your sister look unwel to-day
or your sister seem out of spirit he had appear
on the point either of disclos or of inquir
someth particular about her after a paus of sever
minut their silenc wa broken by hi ask her
in a voic of some agit when he wa to congratul
her on the acquisit of a brother? elinor wa not
prepar for such a question and have no answer readi
wa oblig to adopt the simpl and common expedi
of ask what he meant? he tri to smile as he repli
your sister engag to mr willoughbi is veri gener
known

it cannot be gener known return elinor
for her own famili do not know it

he look surpris and said i beg your pardon
i am afraid my inquiri ha been impertinent; but i had not
suppos ani secreci intend as they openli correspond
and their marriag is univers talk of

how can that be? by whom can you have heard
it mentioned?

by many--bi some of whom you know noth by other
with whom you are most intim mr jen mr palmer
and the middleton but still i might not have believ it
for where the mind is perhap rather unwil to
be convinc it will alway find someth to support
it doubt if i had not when the servant let me in today
accident seen a letter in hi hand direct to
mr willoughbi in your sister write i came to inquir
but i wa convinc befor i could ask the question
is everi thing final settled? is it imposs to-?
but i have no right and i could have no chanc of succeed
excus me miss dashwood i believ i have been wrong
in say so much but i hardli know what to do and on
your prudenc i have the strongest depend tell me
that it is all absolut resolv on that ani attempt
that in short conceal if conceal be possibl
is all that remain

these word which convey to elinor a direct avow
of hi love for her sister affect her veri much
she wa not immedi abl to say anyth and even
when her spirit were recov she debat for a short
time on the answer it would be most proper to give
the real state of thing between willoughbi and her sister
wa so littl known to herself that in endeavour
to explain it she might be as liabl to say too much
as too littl yet as she wa convinc that mariann
affect for willoughbi could leav no hope of colonel
brandon success whatev the event of that affect
might be and at the same time wish to shield her conduct
from censur she thought it most prudent and kind
after some consider to say more than she realli knew
or believ she acknowledg therefor that though
she had never been inform by themselv of the term
on which they stood with each other of their mutual
affect she had no doubt and of their correspond
she wa not astonish to hear

he listen to her with silent attent and on
her ceas to speak rose directli from hi seat
and after say in a voic of emot to your sister
i wish all imagin happiness; to willoughbi that he
may endeavour to deserv her--took leav and went away

elinor deriv no comfort feel from thi
convers to lessen the uneasi of her mind on
other points; she wa left on the contrari with a
melancholi impress of colonel brandon unhappi
and wa prevent even from wish it remov
by her anxieti for the veri event that must confirm it



chapter 28


noth occur dure the next three or four day
to make elinor regret what she had done in appli
to her mother; for willoughbi neither came nor wrote
they were engag about the end of that time to attend
ladi middleton to a parti from which mr jen wa
kept away by the indisposit of her youngest daughter;
and for thi parti mariann wholli dispirit
careless of her appear and seem equal indiffer
whether she went or staid prepar without one look
of hope or one express of pleasur she sat by the
drawing-room fire after tea till the moment of ladi
middleton arriv without onc stir from her seat
or alter her attitud lost in her own thought
and insens of her sister presence; and when at
last they were told that ladi middleton wait for them
at the door she start as if she had forgotten that
ani one wa expect

they arriv in due time at the place of destin
and as soon as the string of carriag befor them
would allow alight ascend the stair heard their
name announc from one landing-plac to anoth in an
audibl voic and enter a room splendidli lit up
quit full of compani and insuffer hot when they had
paid their tribut of polit by curtsi to the ladi
of the hous they were permit to mingl in the crowd
and take their share of the heat and inconveni to
which their arriv must necessarili add after some time
spent in say littl or do less ladi middleton sat
down to cassino and as mariann wa not in spirit for
move about she and elinor luckili succeed to chair
place themselv at no great distanc from the tabl

they had not remain in thi manner long befor elinor
perceiv willoughbi stand within a few yard
of them in earnest convers with a veri fashion
look young woman she soon caught hi eye and he
immedi bow but without attempt to speak to her
or to approach mariann though he could not but see her;
and then continu hi discours with the same ladi
elinor turn involuntarili to mariann to see whether
it could be unobserv by her at that moment she first
perceiv him and her whole counten glow with
sudden delight she would have move toward him instantli
had not her sister caught hold of her

good heavens! she exclaim he is there--h
is there--oh! whi doe he not look at me? whi cannot
i speak to him?

pray pray be compos cri elinor and do
not betray what you feel to everi bodi present
perhap he ha not observ you yet

thi howev wa more than she could believ herself;
and to be compos at such a moment wa not onli beyond
the reach of mariann it wa beyond her wish she sat
in an agoni of impati which affect everi featur

at last he turn round again and regard them both;
she start up and pronounc hi name in a tone
of affect held out her hand to him he approach
and address himself rather to elinor than mariann
as if wish to avoid her eye and determin not to
observ her attitud inquir in a hurri manner after
mr dashwood and ask how long they had been in town
elinor wa rob of all presenc of mind by such an address
and wa unabl to say a word but the feel of her sister
were instantli express her face wa crimson over
and she exclaim in a voic of the greatest emot
good god! willoughbi what is the mean of this?
have you not receiv my letters? will you not shake
hand with me?

he could not then avoid it but her touch seem
pain to him and he held her hand onli for a moment
dure all thi time he wa evid struggl for composur
elinor watch hi counten and saw it express
becom more tranquil after a moment paus he spoke
with calm

i did myself the honour of call in berkeley
street last tuesday and veri much regret that i wa
not fortun enough to find yourselv and mr jen
at home my card wa not lost i hope

but have you not receiv my notes? cri mariann
in the wildest anxieti here is some mistak i am
sure--som dread mistak what can be the mean
of it? tell me willoughby; for heaven sake tell me
what is the matter?

he made no reply; hi complexion chang and all hi
embarrass returned; but as if on catch the eye
of the young ladi with whom he had been previous talk
he felt the necess of instant exert he recov
himself again and after say ye i had the pleasur
of receiv the inform of your arriv in town
which you were so good as to send me turn hastili away
with a slight bow and join hi friend

mariann now look dread white and unabl
to stand sunk into her chair and elinor expect everi
moment to see her faint tri to screen her from the
observ of other while reviv her with lavend water

go to him elinor she cri as soon as she
could speak and forc him to come to me tell him
i must see him again--must speak to him instantly--
i cannot rest--i shall not have a moment peac till thi
is explained--som dread misapprehens or other--
oh go to him thi moment

how can that be done? no my dearest mariann
you must wait thi is not the place for explan
wait onli till tomorrow

with difficulti howev could she prevent her
from follow him herself; and to persuad her to check
her agit to wait at least with the appear
of composur till she might speak to him with more privaci
and more effect wa impossible; for mariann continu
incessantli to give way in a low voic to the miseri
of her feel by exclam of wretched
in a short time elinor saw willoughbi quit the room by the
door toward the staircas and tell mariann that he
wa gone urg the imposs of speak to him again
that even as a fresh argument for her to be calm
she instantli beg her sister would entreat ladi
middleton to take them home as she wa too miser
to stay a minut longer

ladi middleton though in the middl of a rubber
on be inform that mariann wa unwel wa too
polit to object for a moment to her wish of go away
and make over her card to a friend they depart
as soon the carriag could be found scarc a word
wa spoken dure their return to berkeley street
mariann wa in a silent agoni too much oppress even
for tears; but as mr jen wa luckili not come home
they could go directli to their own room where hartshorn
restor her a littl to herself she wa soon undress
and in bed and as she seem desir of be alon
her sister then left her and while she wait the return
of mr jen had leisur enough for think over
the past

that some kind of engag had subsist
between willoughbi and mariann she could not doubt
and that willoughbi wa weari of it seem equal clear;
for howev mariann might still feed her own wish
she could not attribut such behaviour to mistak
or misapprehens of ani kind noth but a thorough
chang of sentiment could account for it her indign
would have been still stronger than it wa had she
not wit that embarrass which seem to speak
a conscious of hi own misconduct and prevent
her from believ him so unprincipl as to have been
sport with the affect of her sister from the first
without ani design that would bear investig
absenc might have weaken hi regard and conveni
might have determin him to overcom it but that such
a regard had formerli exist she could not bring herself
to doubt

as for mariann on the pang which so unhappi a meet
must alreadi have given her and on those still more
sever which might await her in it probabl consequ
she could not reflect without the deepest concern
her own situat gain in the comparison; for while she
could esteem edward as much as ever howev they might be
divid in futur her mind might be alway support
but everi circumst that could embitt such an evil
seem unit to heighten the miseri of mariann
in a final separ from willoughby--in an immedi
and irreconcil ruptur with him



chapter 29


befor the house-maid had lit their fire the next day
or the sun gain ani power over a cold gloomi morn
in januari mariann onli half dress wa kneel
against one of the window-seat for the sake of all
the littl light she could command from it and write
as fast as a continu flow of tear would permit her
in thi situat elinor rous from sleep by her agit
and sob first perceiv her; and after observ her
for a few moment with silent anxieti said in a tone
of the most consider gentl

mariann may i ask-?

no elinor she repli ask nothing; you will
soon know all

the sort of desper calm with which thi wa said
last no longer than while she spoke and wa immedi
follow by a return of the same excess afflict
it wa some minut befor she could go on with her letter
and the frequent burst of grief which still oblig her
at interv to withhold her pen were proof enough of her
feel how more than probabl it wa that she wa write
for the last time to willoughbi

elinor paid her everi quiet and unobtrus attent
in her power; and she would have tri to sooth and
tranquil her still more had not mariann entreat her
with all the eager of the most nervou irrit
not to speak to her for the world in such circumst
it wa better for both that they should not be long together;
and the restless state of mariann mind not onli prevent
her from remain in the room a moment after she wa dress
but requir at onc solitud and continu chang of place
made her wander about the hous till breakfast time avoid
the sight of everi bodi

at breakfast she neither ate nor attempt to eat
ani thing; and elinor attent wa then all employ
not in urg her not in piti her nor in appear
to regard her but in endeavour to engag mr jen
notic entir to herself

as thi wa a favourit meal with mr jen
it last a consider time and they were just set
themselv after it round the common work tabl when a
letter wa deliv to mariann which she eagerli caught
from the servant and turn of a death-lik pale
instantli ran out of the room elinor who saw as plainli
by thi as if she had seen the direct that it must
come from willoughbi felt immedi such a sick
at heart as made her hardli abl to hold up her head
and sat in such a gener tremour as made her fear it
imposs to escap mr jen notic that good ladi
howev saw onli that mariann had receiv a letter
from willoughbi which appear to her a veri good joke
and which she treat accordingli by hope with a laugh
that she would find it to her like of elinor distress
she wa too busili employ in measur length of worst
for her rug to see ani thing at all; and calmli continu
her talk as soon as mariann disappear she said

upon my word i never saw a young woman so
desper in love in my life! my girl were noth
to her and yet they use to be foolish enough; but as
for miss mariann she is quit an alter creatur
i hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her
wait much longer for it is quit grievou to see her
look so ill and forlorn pray when are they to be married?

elinor though never less dispos to speak than at
that moment oblig herself to answer such an attack
as thi and therefor tri to smile repli and have
you realli maam talk yourself into a persuas
of my sister be engag to mr willoughby? i thought
it had been onli a joke but so seriou a question seem
to impli more; and i must beg therefor that you will not
deceiv yourself ani longer i do assur you that noth
would surpris me more than to hear of their be go
to be marri

for shame for shame miss dashwood! how can you
talk so? dont we all know that it must be a match that
they were over head and ear in love with each other from
the first moment they met? did not i see them togeth
in devonshir everi day and all day long; and did not i
know that your sister came to town with me on purpos
to buy wed clothes? come come thi wont do
becaus you are so sli about it yourself you think nobodi
els ha ani senses; but it is no such thing i can tell you
for it ha been known all over town thi ever so long
i tell everi bodi of it and so doe charlott

inde maam said elinor veri serious
you are mistaken inde you are do a veri unkind thing
in spread the report and you will find that you have
though you will not believ me now

mr jen laugh again but elinor had not
spirit to say more and eager at all event to know
what willoughbi had written hurri away to their room
where on open the door she saw mariann stretch on
the bed almost choke by grief one letter in her hand
and two or three other lay by her elinor drew near
but without say a word; and seat herself on the bed
took her hand kiss her affection sever time
and then gave way to a burst of tear which at first
wa scarc less violent than mariann the latter
though unabl to speak seem to feel all the tender
of thi behaviour and after some time thu spent in
joint afflict she put all the letter into elinor hands;
and then cover her face with her handkerchief
almost scream with agoni elinor who knew that such grief
shock as it wa to wit it must have it cours
watch by her till thi excess of suffer had somewhat
spent itself and then turn eagerli to willoughbi letter
read as follows:

i am dear madam
your most obedi
humbl servant
john willoughbi


with what indign such a letter as thi must
be read by miss dashwood may be imagin though awar
befor she began it that it must bring a confess
of hi inconst and confirm their separ for ever
she wa not awar that such languag could be suffer
to announc it; nor could she have suppos willoughbi
capabl of depart so far from the appear of everi
honour and delic feeling--so far from the common
decorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impud
cruel: a letter which instead of bring with hi desir
of a releas ani profess of regret acknowledg no
breach of faith deni all peculiar affect whatever--
a letter of which everi line wa an insult and which
proclaim it writer to be deep in harden villaini

she paus over it for some time with indign
astonishment; then read it again and again; but everi
perus onli serv to increas her abhorr of the man
and so bitter were her feel against him that she
dare not trust herself to speak lest she might wound
mariann still deeper by treat their disengag
not as a loss to her of ani possibl good but as an
escap from the worst and most irremedi of all
evil a connect for life with an unprincipl man
as a deliver the most real a bless the most import

in her earnest medit on the content of the letter
on the deprav of that mind which could dictat it
and probabl on the veri differ mind of a veri differ
person who had no other connect whatev with the affair
than what her heart gave him with everi thing that pass
elinor forgot the immedi distress of her sister
forgot that she had three letter on her lap yet unread
and so entir forgot how long she had been in the room
that when on hear a carriag drive up to the door
she went to the window to see who could be come so
unreason earli she wa all astonish to perceiv
mr jenningss chariot which she knew had not been
order till one determin not to quit mariann
though hopeless of contribut at present to her eas
she hurri away to excus herself from attend
mr jen on account of her sister be indispos
mr jen with a thoroughli good-humour concern
for it caus admit the excus most readili and elinor
after see her safe off return to mariann whom she
found attempt to rise from the bed and whom she reach
just in time to prevent her from fall on the floor
faint and giddi from a long want of proper rest and food;
for it wa mani day sinc she had ani appetit and mani
night sinc she had realli slept; and now when her
mind wa no longer support by the fever of suspens
the consequ of all thi wa felt in an ach head
a weaken stomach and a gener nervou faint
a glass of wine which elinor procur for her directli
made her more comfort and she wa at last abl to express
some sens of her kind by say

poor elinor! how unhappi i make you!

i onli wish repli her sister there were
ani thing i could do which might be of comfort to you

thi as everi thing els would have been
wa too much for mariann who could onli exclaim
in the anguish of her heart oh! elinor i am miser
inde befor her voic wa entir lost in sob

elinor could no longer wit thi torrent
of unresist grief in silenc

exert yourself dear mariann she cri
if you would not kill yourself and all who love you
think of your mother; think of her miseri while you suffer:
for her sake you must exert yourself

i cannot i cannot cri marianne; leav me
leav me if i distress you; leav me hate me forget me!
but do not tortur me so oh! how easi for those
who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion! happi
happi elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer

do you call me happi marianne? ah! if you knew!--and
can you believ me to be so while i see you so wretched!

forgiv me forgiv me throw her arm round
her sister neck; i know you feel for me; i know what
a heart you have; but yet you are--y must be happy;
edward love you--what oh what can do away such happi
as that?

mani mani circumst said elinor solemnli

no no no cri mariann wildli he love you
and onli you you can have no grief

i can have no pleasur while i see you in thi state

and you will never see me otherwis mine is
a miseri which noth can do away

you must not talk so mariann have you no
comforts? no friends? is your loss such as leav
no open for consolation? much as you suffer now
think of what you would have suffer if the discoveri
of hi charact had been delay to a later period--
if your engag had been carri on for month and month
as it might have been befor he chose to put an end to it
everi addit day of unhappi confid on your side
would have made the blow more dread

engagement! cri mariann there ha been
no engag

no engagement!

no he is not so unworthi as you believ him
he ha broken no faith with me

but he told you that he love you

yes--no--nev absolut it wa everi day impli
but never professedli declar sometim i thought it
had been--but it never wa

yet you wrote to him?--

yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?--
but i cannot talk

elinor said no more and turn again to the three
letter which now rais a much stronger curios
than befor directli ran over the content of all
the first which wa what her sister had sent him
on their arriv in town wa to thi effect

berkeley street januari

how surpris you will be willoughbi on
receiv this; and i think you will feel someth
more than surpris when you know that i am in town
an opportun of come hither though with mr
jen wa a temptat we could not resist
i wish you may receiv thi in time to come here
to-night but i will not depend on it at ani rate
i shall expect you to-morrow for the present adieu

md

her second note which had been written on the morn
after the danc at the middleton wa in these words:--

i cannot express my disappoint in have
miss you the day befor yesterday nor my astonish
at not have receiv ani answer to a note which
i sent you abov a week ago i have been expect

hour of the day pray call again as soon as possibl
and explain the reason of my have expect thi

becaus we are gener out by one we were last
night at ladi middleton where there wa a danc
i have been told that you were ask to be of the
parti but could it be so? you must be veri much
alter inde sinc we part if that could be
the case and you not there but i will not suppos
thi possibl and i hope veri soon to receiv your

md

the content of her last note to him were these:--

what am i to imagin willoughbi by your
behaviour last night? again i demand an explan
of it i wa prepar to meet you with the pleasur
which our separ natur produc with the
familiar which our intimaci at barton appear
to me to justifi i wa repuls indeed! i have
pass a wretch night in endeavour to excus
a conduct which can scarc be call less than
insulting; but though i have not yet been abl to
form ani reason apolog for your behaviour
i am perfectli readi to hear your justif of
it you have perhap been misinform or purpos
deceiv in someth concern me which may have
lower me in your opinion tell me what it is
explain the ground on which you act and i shall
be satisfi in be abl to satisfi you it
would griev me inde to be oblig to think ill
of you; but if i am to do it if i am to learn that
you are not what we have hitherto believ you that
your regard for us all wa insincer that your
behaviour to me wa intend onli to deceiv let
it be told as soon as possibl my feel are at
present in a state of dread indecision; i wish
to acquit you but certainti on either side will be
eas to what i now suffer if your sentiment are
no longer what they were you will return my note
and the lock of my hair which is in your possess

md

that such letter so full of affect and confid
could have been so answer elinor for willoughbi sake
would have been unwil to believ but her condemn
of him did not blind her to the improprieti of their
have been written at all; and she wa silent griev
over the imprud which had hazard such unsolicit
proof of tender not warrant by anyth preced
and most sever condemn by the event when mariann
perceiv that she had finish the letter observ to
her that they contain noth but what ani one would
have written in the same situat

i felt myself she ad to be as solemnli
engag to him as if the strictest legal coven
had bound us to each other

i can believ it said elinor; but unfortun
he did not feel the same

he did feel the same elinor--for week and week he
felt it i know he did whatev may have chang him now (and
noth but the blackest art employ against me can have done
it) i wa onc as dear to him as my own soul could wish
thi lock of hair which now he can so readili give up
wa beg of me with the most earnest supplic
had you seen hi look hi manner had you heard hi voic
at that moment! have you forgot the last even of our
be togeth at barton? the morn that we part
too! when he told me that it might be mani week befor
we met again--hi distress--can i ever forget hi distress?

for a moment or two she could say no more;
but when thi emot had pass away she ad
in a firmer tone

elinor i have been cruelli used; but not by willoughbi

dearest mariann who but himself? by whom can he
have been instigated?

by all the world rather than by hi own heart
i could rather believ everi creatur of my acquaint
leagu togeth to ruin me in hi opinion than believ
hi natur capabl of such cruelti thi woman of whom he
writes--whoev she be--or ani one in short but your own
dear self mama and edward may have been so barbar
to beli me beyond you three is there a creatur
in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil
than willoughbi whose heart i know so well?

elinor would not contend and onli repli
whoever may have been so detest your enemi let them
be cheat of their malign triumph my dear sister
by see how nobli the conscious of your own
innoc and good intent support your spirit
it is a reason and laudabl pride which resist
such malevol

no no cri mariann miseri such as mine ha
no pride i care not who know that i am wretch
the triumph of see me so may be open to all the world
elinor elinor they who suffer littl may be proud and
independ as they like--may resist insult or return
mortification--but i cannot i must feel--i must be
wretched--and they are welcom to enjoy the conscious
of it that can

but for my mother sake and mine--

i would do more than for my own but to appear
happi when i am so miserable--oh! who can requir it?

again they were both silent elinor wa employ
in walk thought from the fire to the window
from the window to the fire without know that she
receiv warmth from one or discern object through
the other; and mariann seat at the foot of the bed
with her head lean against one of it post
again took up willoughbi letter and after shudder
over everi sentenc exclaimed--

it is too much! oh willoughbi willoughbi could thi
be yours! cruel cruel--noth can acquit you elinor
noth can whatev he might have heard against me--
ought he not to have suspend hi belief? ought he not to
have told me of it to have given me the power of clear
myself? the lock of hair (repeat it from the letter)
which you so obligingli bestow on me--that is unpardon
willoughbi where wa your heart when you wrote those words?
oh barbar insolent!--elinor can he be justified?

no mariann in no possibl way

and yet thi woman--who know what her art may
have been?--how long it may have been premedit
and how deepli contriv by her!--who is she?--who can
she be?--whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and
attract among hi femal acquaintance?--oh! no one
no one--h talk to me onli of myself

anoth paus ensued; mariann wa greatli agit
and it end thu

elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama
can not we be gone to-morrow?

to-morrow marianne!

ye whi should i stay here? i came onli for
willoughbi sake--and now who care for me? who regard me?

it would be imposs to go to-morrow we owe
mr jen much more than civility; and civil of
the commonest kind must prevent such a hasti remov as that

well then anoth day or two perhaps; but i cannot
stay here long i cannot stay to endur the question
and remark of all these peopl the middleton and
palmers--how am i to bear their pity? the piti of such
a woman as ladi middleton! oh what would he say to that!

elinor advis her to lie down again and for a
moment she did so; but no attitud could give her ease;
and in restless pain of mind and bodi she move from one
postur to anoth till grow more and more hyster
her sister could with difficulti keep her on the bed at all
and for some time wa fear of be constrain to call
for assist some lavend drop howev which she
wa at length persuad to take were of use; and from
that time till mr jen return she continu
on the bed quiet and motionless



chapter 30


mr jen came immedi to their room on her return
and without wait to have her request of admitt answer
open the door and walk in with a look of real concern

how do you do my dear?--said she in a voic of great
compass to mariann who turn away her face without
attempt to answer

how is she miss dashwood?--poor thing! she look veri bad--
no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be marri
veri soon--a good-for-noth fellow! i have no patienc
with him mr taylor told me of it half an hour ago
and she wa told it by a particular friend of miss
grey herself els i am sure i should not have believ it;
and i wa almost readi to sink as it wa well said i
all i can say is that if thi be true he ha use
a young ladi of my acquaint abomin ill and i
wish with all my soul hi wife may plagu hi heart out
and so i shall alway say my dear you may depend on it
i have no notion of men go on in thi way; and if ever
i meet him again i will give him such a dress as he
ha not had thi mani a day but there is one comfort
my dear miss marianne; he is not the onli young man
in the world worth having; and with your pretti face
you will never want admir well poor thing! i wont
disturb her ani longer for she had better have her cri
out at onc and have done with the parri and sanderson
luckili are come tonight you know and that will amus her

she then went away walk on tipto out of the room
as if she suppos her young friend afflict could
be increas by nois

mariann to the surpris of her sister
determin on dine with them elinor even advis
her against it but no she would go down; she could
bear it veri well and the bustl about her would
be less elinor pleas to have her govern for a
moment by such a motiv though believ it hardli
possibl that she could sit out the dinner said no more;
and adjust her dress for her as well as she could
while mariann still remain on the bed wa readi
to assist her into the dine room as soon as they were
summon to it

when there though look most wretchedli
she ate more and wa calmer than her sister had expect
had she tri to speak or had she been consciou of half
mr jenningss well-meant but ill-judg attent
to her thi calm could not have been maintained;
but not a syllabl escap her lips; and the abstract
of her thought preserv her in ignor of everi thing
that wa pass befor her

elinor who did justic to mr jenningss kind
though it effus were often distress and sometim
almost ridicul made her those acknowledg
and return her those civil which her sister could
not make or return for herself their good friend saw
that mariann wa unhappi and felt that everi thing
wa due to her which might make her at all less so
she treat her therefor with all the indulg fond
of a parent toward a favourit child on the last day of
it holiday mariann wa to have the best place by the fire
wa to be tempt to eat by everi delicaci in the hous
and to be amus by the relat of all the news of the day
had not elinor in the sad counten of her sister
seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertain
by mr jenningss endeavour to cure a disappoint in love
by a varieti of sweetmeat and oliv and a good fire
as soon howev as the conscious of all thi wa
forc by continu repetit on mariann she could
stay no longer with a hasti exclam of miseri
and a sign to her sister not to follow her she directli got
up and hurri out of the room

poor soul! cri mr jen as soon as she wa gone
how it griev me to see her! and i declar if she is
not gone away without finish her wine! and the dri
cherri too! lord! noth seem to do her ani good
i am sure if i knew of ani thing she would like i would
send all over the town for it well it is the oddest
thing to me that a man should use such a pretti girl
so ill! but when there is plenti of money on one side
and next to none on the other lord bless you! they care
no more about such things!--

the ladi then--miss grey i think you call her--
is veri rich?

fifti thousand pound my dear did you ever see
her? a smart stylish girl they say but not handsom
i rememb her aunt veri well biddi henshawe; she marri
a veri wealthi man but the famili are all rich togeth
fifti thousand pounds! and by all account it wont come
befor it wanted; for they say he is all to piec
no wonder! dash about with hi curricl and hunters!
well it dont signifi talking; but when a young man
be who he will come and make love to a pretti girl
and promis marriag he ha no busi to fli off
from hi word onli becaus he grow poor and a richer
girl is readi to have him whi dont he in such a case
sell hi hors let hi hous turn off hi servant
and make a thorough reform at once? i warrant you
miss mariann would have been readi to wait till matter
came round but that wont do now-a-days; noth in the
way of pleasur can ever be given up by the young men of
thi age

do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is?
is she said to be amiable?

i never heard ani harm of her; inde i hardli ever
heard her mentioned; except that mr taylor did say
thi morn that one day miss walker hint to her
that she believ mr and mr ellison would not be sorri
to have miss grey marri for she and mr ellison could
never agree--

and who are the ellisons?

her guardian my dear but now she is of age
and may choos for herself; and a pretti choic she ha
made!--what now after paus a moment--your poor sister
is gone to her own room i suppos to moan by herself
is there noth one can get to comfort her? poor dear
it seem quit cruel to let her be alon well by-and-bi we
shall have a few friend and that will amus her a littl
what shall we play at? she hate whist i know; but is there
no round game she care for?

dear maam thi kind is quit unnecessari
mariann i dare say will not leav her room again
thi even i shall persuad her if i can to go
earli to bed for i am sure she want rest

aye i believ that will be best for her let her name
her own supper and go to bed lord! no wonder she ha
been look so bad and so cast down thi last week or two
for thi matter i suppos ha been hang over her head as
long as that and so the letter that came today finish it!
poor soul! i am sure if i had had a notion of it
i would not have joke her about it for all my money
but then you know how should i guess such a thing? i made
sure of it be noth but a common love letter and
you know young peopl like to be laugh at about them lord!
how concern sir john and my daughter will be when they
hear it! if i had my sens about me i might have call
in conduit street in my way home and told them of it
but i shall see them tomorrow

it would be unnecessari i am sure for you to caution
mr palmer and sir john against ever name mr willoughbi
or make the slightest allus to what ha pass
befor my sister their own good-natur must point out
to them the real cruelti of appear to know ani thing
about it when she is present; and the less that may ever
be said to myself on the subject the more my feel
will be spare as you my dear madam will easili believ

oh! lord! ye that i do inde it must be terribl
for you to hear it talk of; and as for your sister
i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her
for the world you saw i did not all dinner time
no more would sir john nor my daughter for they are
all veri thought and considerate; especi if i
give them a hint as i certainli will for my part
i think the less that is said about such thing the better
the sooner ti blown over and forgot and what doe
talk ever do you know?

in thi affair it can onli do harm; more so
perhap than in mani case of a similar kind for it
ha been attend by circumst which for the sake
of everi one concern in it make it unfit to becom
the public convers i must do thi justic to
mr willoughby--h ha broken no posit engag
with my sister

law my dear! dont pretend to defend him
no posit engag indeed! after take her all
over allenham hous and fix on the veri room they
were to live in hereafter!

elinor for her sister sake could not press the
subject farther and she hope it wa not requir of her
for willoughbys; sinc though mariann might lose much
he could gain veri littl by the enforc of the real truth
after a short silenc on both side mr jen
with all her natur hilar burst forth again

well my dear ti a true say about an ill-wind
for it will be all the better for colonel brandon
he will have her at last; aye that he will mind me
now if they ant marri by mid-summ lord! how hell
chuckl over thi news! i hope he will come tonight
it will be all to one a better match for your sister
two thousand a year without debt or drawback--except
the littl love-child indeed; aye i had forgot her;
but she may be prentic out at a small cost and then
what doe it signify? delaford is a nice place i can
tell you; exactli what i call a nice old fashion place
full of comfort and conveniences; quit shut in with great
garden wall that are cover with the best fruit-tre
in the country; and such a mulberri tree in one corner!
lord! how charlott and i did stuff the onli time we
were there! then there is a dove-cot some delight
stew-pond and a veri pretti canal; and everi thing
in short that one could wish for; and moreov it is
close to the church and onli a quarter of a mile from
the turnpike-road so ti never dull for if you onli
go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the hous
you may see all the carriag that pass along
oh! ti a nice place! a butcher hard by in the villag
and the parsonage-hous within a stone throw
to my fanci a thousand time prettier than barton park
where they are forc to send three mile for their meat
and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother
well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can
one shoulder of mutton you know drive anoth down
if we can but put willoughbi out of her head!

ay if we can do that maam said elinor
we shall do veri well with or without colonel brandon
and then rise she went away to join mariann
whom she found as she expect in her own room lean
in silent miseri over the small remain of a fire
which till elinor entranc had been her onli light

you had better leav me wa all the notic
that her sister receiv from her

i will leav you said elinor if you will go
to bed but thi from the momentari pervers
of impati suffer she at first refus to do
her sister earnest though gentl persuas howev
soon soften her to complianc and elinor saw her
lay her ach head on the pillow and as she hope
in a way to get some quiet rest befor she left her

in the drawing-room whither she then repair
she wa soon join by mr jen with a wine-glass
full of someth in her hand

my dear said she enter i have just recollect
that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the
hous that ever wa tast so i have brought a glass of it
for your sister my poor husband! how fond he wa of it!
whenev he had a touch of hi old colicki gout he said
it did him more good than ani thing els in the world
do take it to your sister

dear maam repli elinor smile at the differ
of the complaint for which it wa recommend how good
you are! but i have just left mariann in bed and i hope
almost asleep; and as i think noth will be of so much
servic to her as rest if you will give me leav
i will drink the wine myself

mr jen though regret that she had not been
five minut earlier wa satisfi with the compromise;
and elinor as she swallow the chief of it reflect
that though it effect on a colicki gout were at present
of littl import to her it heal power
on a disappoint heart might be as reason tri
on herself as on her sister

colonel brandon came in while the parti were at tea
and by hi manner of look round the room for mariann
elinor immedi fanci that he neither expect
nor wish to see her there and in short that he
wa alreadi awar of what occas her absenc
mr jen wa not struck by the same thought;
for soon after hi entranc she walk across the room
to the tea-tabl where elinor presid and whispered--
the colonel look as grave as ever you see he know
noth of it; do tell him my dear

he shortli afterward drew a chair close to her
and with a look which perfectli assur her of hi
good inform inquir after her sister

mariann is not well said she she ha been
indispos all day and we have persuad her to go to bed

perhap then he hesitatingli repli what i
heard thi morn may be--ther may be more truth in it
than i could believ possibl at first

what did you hear?

that a gentleman whom i had reason to think--in short
that a man whom i knew to be engaged--but how shall i
tell you? if you know it alreadi as sure you must
i may be spare

you mean answer elinor with forc calm
mr willoughbi marriag with miss grey ye we do
know it all thi seem to have been a day of gener
elucid for thi veri morn first unfold it to us
mr willoughbi is unfathomable! where did you hear it?

in a station shop in pall mall where i
had busi two ladi were wait for their carriag
and one of them wa give the other an account of the
intend match in a voic so littl attempt conceal
that it wa imposs for me not to hear all the name
of willoughbi john willoughbi frequent repeat
first caught my attention; and what follow wa a posit
assert that everi thing wa now final settl
respect hi marriag with miss grey--it wa no longer
to be a secret--it would take place even within a few week
with mani particular of prepar and other matter
one thing especi i rememb becaus it serv
to identifi the man still more:--a soon as the ceremoni
wa over they were to go to comb magna hi seat
in somersetshir my astonishment!--but it would be
imposs to describ what i felt the commun
ladi i learnt on inquiri for i stay in the shop
till they were gone wa a mr ellison and that as i
have been sinc inform is the name of miss grey guardian

it is but have you likewis heard that miss grey
ha fifti thousand pounds? in that if in ani thing
we may find an explan

it may be so; but willoughbi is capable--at least
i think--h stop a moment; then ad in a voic
which seem to distrust itself and your sister--
how did she--

her suffer have been veri sever i have
onli to hope that they may be proportion short
it ha been it is a most cruel afflict till yesterday
i believ she never doubt hi regard; and even now
perhaps--but i am almost convinc that he never wa
realli attach to her he ha been veri deceitful! and
in some point there seem a hard of heart about him

ah! said colonel brandon there is indeed! but
your sister doe not--i think you said so--sh doe
not consid quit as you do?

you know her disposit and may believ how eagerli
she would still justifi him if she could

he made no answer; and soon afterward by the remov
of the tea-th and the arrang of the card parti
the subject wa necessarili drop mr jen who had
watch them with pleasur while they were talk and who
expect to see the effect of miss dashwood commun
in such an instantan gaieti on colonel brandon side
as might have becom a man in the bloom of youth of hope
and happi saw him with amaz remain the whole
even more seriou and thought than usual



chapter 31


from a night of more sleep than she had expect
mariann awok the next morn to the same conscious
of miseri in which she had close her eye

elinor encourag her as much as possibl to talk
of what she felt; and befor breakfast wa readi they had
gone through the subject again and again; and with the same
steadi convict and affection counsel on elinor side
the same impetu feel and vari opinion on
mariann as befor sometim she could believ
willoughbi to be as unfortun and as innoc as herself
and at other lost everi consol in the imposs
of acquit him at one moment she wa absolut
indiffer to the observ of all the world at anoth
she would seclud herself from it for ever and at a third
could resist it with energi in one thing howev
she wa uniform when it came to the point in avoid
where it wa possibl the presenc of mr jen
and in a determin silenc when oblig to endur it
her heart wa harden against the belief of mr jenningss
enter into her sorrow with ani compass

no no no it cannot be she cried;
she cannot feel her kind is not sympathy;
her good-natur is not tender all that she want
is gossip and she onli like me now becaus i suppli it

elinor had not need thi to be assur of the injustic
to which her sister wa often led in her opinion of other
by the irrit refin of her own mind and the too
great import place by her on the delicaci of a
strong sensibl and the grace of a polish manner
like half the rest of the world if more than half there
be that are clever and good mariann with excel
abil and an excel disposit wa neither
reason nor candid she expect from other peopl
the same opinion and feel as her own and she judg
of their motiv by the immedi effect of their action
on herself thu a circumst occur while the
sister were togeth in their own room after breakfast
which sunk the heart of mr jen still lower
in her estimation; becaus through her own weak
it chanc to prove a sourc of fresh pain to herself
though mr jen wa govern in it by an impuls
of the utmost goodwil

with a letter in her outstretch hand and counten
gaili smile from the persuas of bring comfort
she enter their room say

now my dear i bring you someth that i am sure
will do you good

mariann heard enough in one moment her imagin
place befor her a letter from willoughbi full of tender
and contrit explanatori of all that had pass satisfactori
convincing; and instantli follow by willoughbi himself
rush eagerli into the room to inforc at her feet
by the eloqu of hi eye the assur of hi letter
the work of one moment wa destroy by the next
the hand write of her mother never till then unwelcom
wa befor her; and in the acut of the disappoint
which follow such an ecstasi of more than hope
she felt as if till that instant she had never suffer

the cruelti of mr jen no languag within
her reach in her moment of happiest eloqu
could have expressed; and now she could reproach her
onli by the tear which stream from her eye with
passion violence--a reproach howev so entir
lost on it object that after mani express of piti
she withdrew still refer her to the letter of comfort
but the letter when she wa calm enough to read it
brought littl comfort willoughbi fill everi page
her mother still confid of their engag and reli
as warmli as ever on hi constanc had onli been rous
by elinor applic to intreat from mariann greater
open toward them both; and thi with such tender
toward her such affect for willoughbi and such
a convict of their futur happi in each other
that she wept with agoni through the whole of it

all her impati to be at home again now returned;
her mother wa dearer to her than ever; dearer through
the veri excess of her mistaken confid in willoughbi
and she wa wildli urgent to be gone elinor unabl herself
to determin whether it were better for mariann to be
in london or at barton offer no counsel of her own
except of patienc till their mother wish could be known;
and at length she obtain her sister consent to wait
for that knowledg

mr jen left them earlier than usual; for she
could not be easi till the middleton and palmer were abl
to griev as much as herself; and posit refus
elinor offer attend went out alon for the rest
of the morn elinor with a veri heavi heart awar of
the pain she wa go to commun and perceiv
by mariann letter how ill she had succeed in lay
ani foundat for it then sat down to write her mother
an account of what had pass and entreat her direct
for the future; while mariann who came into the drawing-room
on mr jenningss go away remain fix at the tabl
where elinor wrote watch the advanc of her pen
griev over her for the hardship of such a task
and griev still more fondli over it effect on her mother

in thi manner they had continu about a quarter
of an hour when mariann whose nerv could not then
bear ani sudden nois wa startl by a rap at the door

who can thi be? cri elinor so earli too! i
thought we had been safe

mariann move to the window--

it is colonel brandon! said she with vexat
we are never safe from him

he will not come in as mr jen is from home

i will not trust to that retreat to her own room
a man who ha noth to do with hi own time ha no
conscienc in hi intrus on that of other

the event prove her conjectur right though it
wa found on injustic and error; for colonel brandon
did come in; and elinor who wa convinc that
solicitud for mariann brought him thither and who saw
that solicitud in hi disturb and melancholi look
and in hi anxiou though brief inquiri after her
could not forgiv her sister for esteem him so lightli

i met mr jen in bond street said he
after the first salut and she encourag me
to come on; and i wa the more easili encourag
becaus i thought it probabl that i might find you alon
which i wa veri desir of do my object--mi
wish--mi sole wish in desir it--i hope i believ
it is--i to be a mean of give comfort;--no i must
not say comfort--not present comfort--but convict
last convict to your sister mind my regard for her
for yourself for your mother--wil you allow me to prove it
by relat some circumst which noth but a veri
sincer regard--noth but an earnest desir of be
useful--i think i am justified--though where so mani hour
have been spent in convinc myself that i am right
is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong?
he stop

i understand you said elinor you have someth
to tell me of mr willoughbi that will open hi charact
farther your tell it will be the greatest act of friendship
that can be shewn mariann my gratitud will be insur
immedi by ani inform tend to that end and her
must be gain by it in time pray pray let me hear it

you shall; and to be brief when i quit barton
last october--but thi will give you no idea--i must go
farther back you will find me a veri awkward narrat
miss dashwood; i hardli know where to begin a short
account of myself i believ will be necessari and it
shall be a short one on such a subject sigh heavili
can i have littl temptat to be diffus

he stopt a moment for recollect and then
with anoth sigh went on

you have probabl entir forgotten a conversation--
(it is not to be suppos that it could make ani impress
on you)--a convers between us one even at barton
park--it wa the even of a dance--in which i allud
to a ladi i had onc known as resembl in some measur
your sister mariann

inde answer elinor i have not forgotten it
he look pleas by thi remembr and ad

if i am not deceiv by the uncertainti the partial
of tender recollect there is a veri strong resembl
between them as well in mind as person the same warmth
of heart the same eager of fanci and spirit
thi ladi wa one of my nearest relat an orphan from
her infanc and under the guardianship of my father
our age were nearli the same and from our earliest year
we were playfellow and friend i cannot rememb the
time when i did not love eliza; and my affect for her
as we grew up wa such as perhap judg from my
present forlorn and cheerless graviti you might think me
incap of have ever felt her for me wa i believ
fervent as the attach of your sister to mr willoughbi
and it wa though from a differ caus no less unfortun
at seventeen she wa lost to me for ever she wa
married--marri against her inclin to my brother
her fortun wa larg and our famili estat much encumb
and thi i fear is all that can be said for the
conduct of one who wa at onc her uncl and guardian
my brother did not deserv her; he did not even love her
i had hope that her regard for me would support her
under ani difficulti and for some time it did; but at
last the miseri of her situat for she experienc
great unkind overcam all her resolut and though
she had promis me that nothing--but how blindli i
relate! i have never told you how thi wa brought on
we were within a few hour of elop togeth for scotland
the treacheri or the folli of my cousin maid betray us
i wa banish to the hous of a relat far distant
and she wa allow no liberti no societi no amus
till my father point wa gain i had depend on her
fortitud too far and the blow wa a sever one--
but had her marriag been happi so young as i then wa
a few month must have reconcil me to it or at least
i should not have now to lament it thi howev
wa not the case my brother had no regard for her;
hi pleasur were not what they ought to have been
and from the first he treat her unkindli the consequ
of thi upon a mind so young so live so inexperienc
as mr brandon wa but too natur she resign
herself at first to all the miseri of her situation;
and happi had it been if she had not live to overcom those
regret which the remembr of me occas but can we
wonder that with such a husband to provok inconst
and without a friend to advis or restrain her (for
my father live onli a few month after their marriag
and i wa with my regiment in the east indies) she
should fall? had i remain in england perhaps--but i
meant to promot the happi of both by remov
from her for year and for that purpos had procur
my exchang the shock which her marriag had given me
he continu in a voic of great agit wa of
trifl weight--wa noth to what i felt when i heard
about two year afterward of her divorc it wa
that which threw thi gloom--even now the recollect
of what i suffered--

he could say no more and rise hastili walk for a few
minut about the room elinor affect by hi relat
and still more by hi distress could not speak he saw
her concern and come to her took her hand press it
and kiss it with grate respect a few minut more
of silent exert enabl him to proceed with composur

it wa nearli three year after thi unhappi
period befor i return to england my first care
when i did arriv wa of cours to seek for her;
but the search wa as fruitless as it wa melancholi
i could not trace her beyond her first seduc and there
wa everi reason to fear that she had remov from him
onli to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allow
wa not adequ to her fortun nor suffici for her
comfort mainten and i learnt from my brother that
the power of receiv it had been made over some month
befor to anoth person he imagin and calmli could he
imagin it that her extravag and consequ distress
had oblig her to dispos of it for some immedi relief
at last howev and after i had been six month in england
i did find her regard for a former servant of my own
who had sinc fallen into misfortun carri me to visit
him in a spunging-hous where he wa confin for debt;
and there the same hous under a similar confin
wa my unfortun sister so altered--so faded--worn
down by acut suffer of everi kind! hardli could i
believ the melancholi and sickli figur befor me
to be the remain of the love bloom health girl
on whom i had onc dote what i endur in so behold
her--but i have no right to wound your feel by attempt
to describ it--i have pain you too much alreadi
that she wa to all appear in the last stage
of a consumpt was--y in such a situat it wa
my greatest comfort life could do noth for her
beyond give time for a better prepar for death;
and that wa given i saw her place in comfort lodg
and under proper attendants; i visit her everi day
dure the rest of her short life: i wa with her in her
last moment

again he stop to recov himself; and elinor
spoke her feel in an exclam of tender concern
at the fate of hi unfortun friend

your sister i hope cannot be offend said he
by the resembl i have fanci between her and my
poor disgrac relat their fate their fortun
cannot be the same; and had the natur sweet
disposit of the one been guard by a firmer mind
or a happier marriag she might have been all that you
will live to see the other be but to what doe all thi
lead? i seem to have been distress you for noth
ah! miss dashwood--a subject such as this--untouch
for fourteen years--it is danger to handl it at all!
i will be more collected--mor concis she left to my care
her onli child a littl girl the offspr of her first
guilti connect who wa then about three year old
she love the child and had alway kept it with her
it wa a valu a preciou trust to me; and gladli
would i have discharg it in the strictest sens
by watch over her educ myself had the natur
of our situat allow it; but i had no famili no home;
and my littl eliza wa therefor place at school
i saw her there whenev i could and after the death of my
brother (which happen about five year ago and which
left to me the possess of the famili property) she
visit me at delaford i call her a distant relation;
but i am well awar that i have in gener been suspect
of a much nearer connect with her it is now three
year ago (she had just reach her fourteenth year)
that i remov her from school to place her under the care
of a veri respect woman resid in dorsetshir
who had the charg of four or five other girl of about
the same time of life; and for two year i had everi reason
to be pleas with her situat but last februari
almost a twelvemonth back she suddenli disappear
i had allow her (imprud as it ha sinc turn
out) at her earnest desir to go to bath with one of
her young friend who wa attend her father there
for hi health i knew him to be a veri good sort of man
and i thought well of hi daughter--bett than she deserv
for with a most obstin and ill-judg secreci
she would tell noth would give no clue though she
certainli knew all he her father a well-mean
but not a quick-sight man could realli i believ
give no information; for he had been gener confin
to the hous while the girl were rang over the town
and make what acquaint they chose; and he tri
to convinc me as thoroughli as he wa convinc himself
of hi daughter be entir unconcern in the busi
in short i could learn noth but that she wa gone;
all the rest for eight long month wa left to conjectur
what i thought what i fear may be imagined; and what i
suffer too

good heavens! cri elinor could it be--could
willoughby!--

the first news that reach me of her he continu
came in a letter from herself last octob
it wa forward to me from delaford and i receiv it
on the veri morn of our intend parti to whitwell;
and thi wa the reason of my leav barton so suddenli
which i am sure must at the time have appear strang
to everi bodi and which i believ gave offenc to some
littl did mr willoughbi imagin i suppos when hi
look censur me for incivil in break up the parti
that i wa call away to the relief of one whom he
had made poor and miserable; but had he known it
what would it have availed? would he have been less
gay or less happi in the smile of your sister? no
he had alreadi done that which no man who can feel
for anoth would do he had left the girl whose
youth and innoc he had seduc in a situat of
the utmost distress with no credit home no help
no friend ignor of hi address! he had left her
promis to return; he neither return nor wrote
nor reliev her

thi is beyond everi thing! exclaim elinor

hi charact is now befor you; expens dissip
and wors than both know all thi as i have now
known it mani week guess what i must have felt on see
your sister as fond of him as ever and on be assur
that she wa to marri him: guess what i must have felt
for all your sake when i came to you last week and
found you alon i came determin to know the truth;
though irresolut what to do when it wa known
my behaviour must have seem strang to you then;
but now you will comprehend it to suffer you all to be
so deceived; to see your sister--but what could i do?
i had no hope of interf with success; and sometim
i thought your sister influenc might yet reclaim him
but now after such dishonor usag who can tell what
were hi design on her whatev they may have been
howev she may now and hereaft doubtless will
turn with gratitud toward her own condit when she
compar it with that of my poor eliza when she consid
the wretch and hopeless situat of thi poor girl
and pictur her to herself with an affect for him so strong
still as strong as her own and with a mind torment
by self-reproach which must attend her through life
sure thi comparison must have it use with her
she will feel her own suffer to be noth they
proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrac
on the contrari everi friend must be made still more
her friend by them concern for her unhappi
and respect for her fortitud under it must strengthen
everi attach use your own discret howev
in commun to her what i have told you you must
know best what will be it effect; but had i not serious
and from my heart believ it might be of servic
might lessen her regret i would not have suffer
myself to troubl you with thi account of my famili
afflict with a recit which may seem to have been
intend to rais myself at the expens of other

elinor thank follow thi speech with grate
earnestness; attend too with the assur of her
expect materi advantag to mariann from the
commun of what had pass

i have been more pain said she by her
endeavor to acquit him than by all the rest; for it
irrit her mind more than the most perfect convict
of hi unworthi can do now though at first she
will suffer much i am sure she will soon becom easier
have you she continu after a short silenc
ever seen mr willoughbi sinc you left him at barton?

ye he repli grave onc i have one meet
wa unavoid

elinor startl by hi manner look at him anxious
say

what? have you met him to--

i could meet him no other way eliza had confess
to me though most reluctantli the name of her lover;
and when he return to town which wa within a fortnight
after myself we met by appoint he to defend
i to punish hi conduct we return unwound
and the meet therefor never got abroad

elinor sigh over the fanci necess of this;
but to a man and a soldier she presum not to censur it

such said colonel brandon after a paus
ha been the unhappi resembl between the fate of mother
and daughter! and so imperfectli have i discharg my trust!

is she still in town?

no; as soon as she recov from her lying-in
for i found her near her deliveri i remov her and her
child into the countri and there she remain

recollect soon afterward that he wa probabl
divid elinor from her sister he put an end to hi visit
receiv from her again the same grate acknowledg
and leav her full of compass and esteem for him



chapter 32


when the particular of thi convers were repeat
by miss dashwood to her sister as they veri soon were
the effect on her wa not entir such as the former
had hope to see not that mariann appear to distrust
the truth of ani part of it for she listen to it all
with the most steadi and submiss attent made neither
object nor remark attempt no vindic of willoughbi
and seem to shew by her tear that she felt it to
be imposs but though thi behaviour assur elinor
that the convict of thi guilt wa carri home to
her mind though she saw with satisfact the effect of it
in her no longer avoid colonel brandon when he call
in her speak to him even voluntarili speak
with a kind of compassion respect and though she
saw her spirit less violent irrit than befor
she did not see her less wretch her mind did becom
settl but it wa settl in a gloomi deject
she felt the loss of willoughbi charact yet more heavili
than she had felt the loss of hi heart; hi seduct and
desert of miss william the miseri of that poor girl
and the doubt of what hi design might onc have been
on herself prey altogeth so much on her spirit
that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt
even to elinor; and brood over her sorrow in silenc
gave more pain to her sister than could have been commun
by the most open and most frequent confess of them

to give the feel or the languag of mr dashwood
on receiv and answer elinor letter would be onli
to give a repetit of what her daughter had alreadi felt
and said; of a disappoint hardli less pain than
mariann and an indign even greater than elinor
long letter from her quickli succeed each other
arriv to tell all that she suffer and thought;
to express her anxiou solicitud for mariann and entreat
she would bear up with fortitud under thi misfortun
bad inde must the natur of mariann afflict be
when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifi
and humili must be the origin of those regret
which she could wish her not to indulge!

against the interest of her own individu comfort
mr dashwood had determin that it would be better for
mariann to be ani where at that time than at barton
where everi thing within her view would be bring back
the past in the strongest and most afflict manner
by constantli place willoughbi befor her such as
she had alway seen him there she recommend it to
her daughter therefor by all mean not to shorten their
visit to mr jennings; the length of which though never
exactli fix had been expect by all to compris at least
five or six week a varieti of occup of object
and of compani which could not be procur at barton
would be inevit there and might yet she hope
cheat mariann at time into some interest beyond herself
and even into some amus much as the idea of both
might now be spurn by her

from all danger of see willoughbi again
her mother consid her to be at least equal safe
in town as in the countri sinc hi acquaint must
now be drop by all who call themselv her friend
design could never bring them in each other way:
neglig could never leav them expos to a surprise;
and chanc had less in it favour in the crowd of london
than even in the retir of barton where it might
forc him befor her while pay that visit at allenham
on hi marriag which mr dashwood from forese at
first as a probabl event had brought herself to expect
as a certain one

she had yet anoth reason for wish her children
to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law
had told her that he and hi wife were to be in town
befor the middl of februari and she judg it right
that they should sometim see their brother

mariann had promis to be guid by her mother opinion
and she submit to it therefor without opposit
though it prove perfectli differ from what she wish
and expect though she felt it to be entir wrong
form on mistaken ground and that by requir her
longer continu in london it depriv her of the onli
possibl allevi of her wretched the person
sympathi of her mother and doom her to such societi and
such scene as must prevent her ever know a moment rest

but it wa a matter of great consol to her
that what brought evil to herself would bring good to
her sister; and elinor on the other hand suspect that
it would not be in her power to avoid edward entir
comfort herself by think that though their longer
stay would therefor milit against her own happi
it would be better for mariann than an immedi return
into devonshir

her care in guard her sister from ever
hear willoughbi name mention wa not thrown away
mariann though without know it herself reap all
it advantage; for neither mr jen nor sir john
nor even mr palmer herself ever spoke of him befor her
elinor wish that the same forbear could have extend
toward herself but that wa imposs and she wa
oblig to listen day after day to the indign of them all

sir john could not have thought it possibl
a man of whom he had alway had such reason to think well!
such a good-natur fellow! he did not believ there wa a
bolder rider in england! it wa an unaccount busi
he wish him at the devil with all hi heart he would
not speak anoth word to him meet him where he might
for all the world! no not if it were to be by the side
of barton covert and they were kept watch for two
hour togeth such a scoundrel of a fellow! such
a deceit dog! it wa onli the last time they met
that he had offer him one of folli puppies! and thi
wa the end of it!

mr palmer in her way wa equal angri
she wa determin to drop hi acquaint immedi
and she wa veri thank that she had never been acquaint
with him at all she wish with all her heart comb
magna wa not so near cleveland; but it did not signifi
for it wa a great deal too far off to visit; she hate
him so much that she wa resolv never to mention
hi name again and she should tell everybodi she saw
how good-for-noth he wa

the rest of mr palmer sympathi wa shewn in procur
all the particular in her power of the approach marriag
and commun them to elinor she could soon tell
at what coachmak the new carriag wa build
by what painter mr willoughbi portrait wa drawn
and at what warehous miss grey cloth might be seen

the calm and polit unconcern of ladi middleton
on the occas wa a happi relief to elinor spirit
oppress as they often were by the clamor kind
of the other it wa a great comfort to her to be sure
of excit no interest in one person at least among their
circl of friends: a great comfort to know that there
wa one who would meet her without feel ani curios
after particular or ani anxieti for her sister health

everi qualif is rais at time by the
circumst of the moment to more than it real value;
and she wa sometim worri down by offici condol
to rate good-breed as more indispens to comfort
than good-natur

ladi middleton express her sens of the affair
about onc everi day or twice if the subject occur
veri often by say it is veri shock indeed!
and by the mean of thi continu though gentl vent
wa abl not onli to see the miss dashwood from the
first without the smallest emot but veri soon
to see them without recollect a word of the matter;
and have thu support the digniti of her own sex
and spoken her decid censur of what wa wrong
in the other she thought herself at liberti to attend
to the interest of her own assembl and therefor
determin (though rather against the opinion of sir john)
that as mr willoughbi would at onc be a woman of eleg
and fortun to leav her card with her as soon as she marri

colonel brandon delic unobtrus enquiri
were never unwelcom to miss dashwood he had abundantli
earn the privileg of intim discuss of her
sister disappoint by the friendli zeal with
which he had endeavour to soften it and they alway
convers with confid hi chief reward for the
pain exert of disclos past sorrow and present
humili wa given in the piti eye with which
mariann sometim observ him and the gentl
of her voic whenev (though it did not often happen)
she wa oblig or could oblig herself to speak to him
these assur him that hi exert had produc an
increas of good-wil toward himself and these gave
elinor hope of it be farther augment hereafter;
but mr jen who knew noth of all thi who knew
onli that the colonel continu as grave as ever and that
she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself
nor commiss her to make it for him began at the
end of two day to think that instead of midsumm
they would not be marri till michaelma and by the
end of a week that it would not be a match at all
the good understand between the colonel and miss
dashwood seem rather to declar that the honour
of the mulberry-tre the canal and the yew arbour
would all be made over to her; and mr jen had
for some time ceas to think at all of mr ferrar

earli in februari within a fortnight from the
receipt of willoughbi letter elinor had the pain
offic of inform her sister that he wa marri
she had taken care to have the intellig convey
to herself as soon as it wa known that the ceremoni
wa over as she wa desir that mariann should not
receiv the first notic of it from the public paper
which she saw her eagerli examin everi morn

she receiv the news with resolut composure;
made no observ on it and at first shed no tears;
but after a short time they would burst out and for the
rest of the day she wa in a state hardli less pitiabl
than when she first learnt to expect the event

the willoughbi left town as soon as they were married;
and elinor now hope as there could be no danger
of her see either of them to prevail on her sister
who had never yet left the hous sinc the blow first fell
to go out again by degre as she had done befor

about thi time the two miss steel late arriv
at their cousin hous in bartlett build
holburn present themselv again befor their more
grand relat in conduit and berkeley streets;
and were welcom by them all with great cordial

elinor onli wa sorri to see them their presenc
alway gave her pain and she hardli knew how to make
a veri graciou return to the overpow delight of luci
in find her still in town

i should have been quit disappoint if i had not
found you here still said she repeatedli with a strong
emphasi on the word but i alway thought i should
i wa almost sure you would not leav london yet awhile;
though you told me you know at barton that you should
not stay abov a month but i thought at the time
that you would most like chang your mind when it came
to the point it would have been such a great piti
to have went away befor your brother and sister came
and now to be sure you will be in no hurri to be gone
i am amazingli glad you did not keep to your word

elinor perfectli understood her and wa forc
to use all her self-command to make it appear that she
did not

well my dear said mr jen and how did
you travel?

not in the stage i assur you repli miss steel
with quick exultation; we came post all the way and had
a veri smart beau to attend us dr davi wa come
to town and so we thought wed join him in a post-chaise;
and he behav veri genteelli and paid ten or twelv
shill more than we did

oh oh! cri mr jennings; veri pretti
indeed! and the doctor is a singl man i warrant you

there now said miss steel affectedli simper
everybodi laugh at me so about the doctor and i
cannot think whi my cousin say they are sure i have
made a conquest; but for my part i declar i never think
about him from one hour end to anoth lord! here
come your beau nanci my cousin said tother day
when she saw him cross the street to the hous
my beau indeed! said i--i cannot think who you mean
the doctor is no beau of mine

aye aye that is veri pretti talking--but it wont do--
the doctor is the man i see

no indeed! repli her cousin with affect earnest
and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talk
of

mr jen directli gave her the gratifi
assur that she certainli would not and miss steel
wa made complet happi

i suppos you will go and stay with your brother
and sister miss dashwood when they come to town
said luci return after a cessat of hostil hint
to the charg

no i do not think we shall

oh ye i dare say you will

elinor would not humour her by farther opposit

what a charm thing it is that mr dashwood can
spare you both for so long a time together!

long a time indeed! interpos mr jen
whi their visit is but just begun!

luci wa silenc

i am sorri we cannot see your sister miss dashwood
said miss steel i am sorri she is not well--
for mariann had left the room on their arriv

you are veri good my sister will be equal
sorri to miss the pleasur of see you; but she ha
been veri much plagu late with nervou head-ach
which make her unfit for compani or convers

oh dear that is a great pity! but such old
friend as luci and me!--i think she might see us;
and i am sure we would not speak a word

elinor with great civil declin the propos
her sister wa perhap laid down upon the bed or in her
dress gown and therefor not abl to come to them

oh if that all cri miss steel we can
just as well go and see her

elinor began to find thi impertin too much for
her temper; but she wa save the troubl of check it
by luci sharp reprimand which now as on mani occas
though it did not give much sweet to the manner
of one sister wa of advantag in govern those of
the other



chapter 33


after some opposit mariann yield to her
sister entreati and consent to go out with her
and mr jen one morn for half an hour she
expressli condit howev for pay no visit
and would do no more than accompani them to gray in
sackvil street where elinor wa carri on a negoti
for the exchang of a few old-fashion jewel of her mother

when they stop at the door mr jen recollect
that there wa a ladi at the other end of the street
on whom she ought to call; and as she had no busi
at gray it wa resolv that while her young friend
transact their she should pay her visit and
return for them

on ascend the stair the miss dashwood found
so mani peopl befor them in the room that there wa
not a person at liberti to tend to their orders; and they
were oblig to wait all that could be done wa to sit
down at that end of the counter which seem to promis the
quickest succession; one gentleman onli wa stand there
and it is probabl that elinor wa not without hope
of excit hi polit to a quicker despatch
but the correct of hi eye and the delicaci
of hi tast prove to be beyond hi polit
he wa give order for a toothpick-cas for himself
and till it size shape and ornament were determin
all of which after examin and debat for a quarter
of an hour over everi toothpick-cas in the shop
were final arrang by hi own invent fanci he had
no leisur to bestow ani other attent on the two ladi
than what wa compris in three or four veri broad stares;
a kind of notic which serv to imprint on elinor
the remembr of a person and face of strong
natur sterl insignific though adorn in
the first style of fashion

mariann wa spare from the troublesom feel
of contempt and resent on thi impertin examin
of their featur and on the puppyism of hi manner
in decid on all the differ horror of the differ
toothpick-cas present to hi inspect by remain
unconsci of it all; for she wa as well abl to collect
her thought within herself and be as ignor of what wa
pass around her in mr gray shop as in her own bedroom

at last the affair wa decid the ivori
the gold and the pearl all receiv their appoint
and the gentleman have name the last day on which hi
exist could be continu without the possess of the
toothpick-cas drew on hi glove with leisur care
and bestow anoth glanc on the miss dashwood but such
a one as seem rather to demand than express admir
walk off with a happi air of real conceit and affect
indiffer

elinor lost no time in bring her busi forward
wa on the point of conclud it when anoth gentleman
present himself at her side she turn her eye toward
hi face and found him with some surpris to be her brother

their affect and pleasur in meet wa just enough
to make a veri credit appear in mr gray shop
john dashwood wa realli far from be sorri to see
hi sister again; it rather gave them satisfaction;
and hi inquiri after their mother were respect
and attent

elinor found that he and fanni had been in town
two day

i wish veri much to call upon you yesterday
said he but it wa imposs for we were oblig
to take harri to see the wild beast at exet exchange;
and we spent the rest of the day with mr ferrar
harri wa vastli pleas thi morn i had fulli intend
to call on you if i could possibl find a spare half hour
but one ha alway so much to do on first come to town
i am come here to bespeak fanni a seal but tomorrow i
think i shall certainli be abl to call in berkeley street
and be introduc to your friend mr jen
i understand she is a woman of veri good fortun
and the middleton too you must introduc me to them
as my mother-in-law relat i shall be happi to show
them everi respect they are excel neighbour to you in
the countri i understand

excel inde their attent to our comfort
their friendli in everi particular is more than i
can express

i am extrem glad to hear it upon my word;
extrem glad inde but so it ought to be; they are
peopl of larg fortun they are relat to you and
everi civil and accommod that can serv to make
your situat pleasant might be reason expect
and so you are most comfort settl in your littl cottag
and want for nothing! edward brought us a most charm
account of the place: the most complet thing of it kind
he said that ever wa and you all seem to enjoy it beyond
ani thing it wa a great satisfact to us to hear it
i assur you

elinor did feel a littl asham of her brother;
and wa not sorri to be spare the necess of answer him
by the arriv of mr jenningss servant who came to tell
her that hi mistress wait for them at the door

mr dashwood attend them down stair wa introduc
to mr jen at the door of her carriag and repeat
hi hope of be abl to call on them the next day
took leav

hi visit wa duli paid he came with a pretenc at
an apolog from their sister-in-law for not come too;
but she wa so much engag with her mother that realli
she had no leisur for go ani where mr jen
howev assur him directli that she should not stand
upon ceremoni for they were all cousin or someth
like it and she should certainli wait on mr john
dashwood veri soon and bring her sister to see her
hi manner to them though calm were perfectli kind;
to mr jen most attent civil; and on colonel
brandon come in soon after himself he eye him with a
curios which seem to say that he onli want to know
him to be rich to be equal civil to him

after stay with them half an hour he ask
elinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduc
him to sir john and ladi middleton the weather wa
remark fine and she readili consent as soon
as they were out of the hous hi enquiri began

who is colonel brandon? is he a man of fortune?

yes; he ha veri good properti in dorsetshir

i am glad of it he seem a most gentlemanlik man;
and i think elinor i may congratul you on the prospect
of a veri respect establish in life

me brother! what do you mean?

he like you i observ him narrowli and am
convinc of it what is the amount of hi fortune?

i believ about two thousand a year

two thousand a-year; and then work himself
up to a pitch of enthusiast generos he ad
elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much
for your sake

inde i believ you repli elinor; but i am
veri sure that colonel brandon ha not the smallest wish
of marri me

you are mistaken elinor; you are veri much mistaken
a veri littl troubl on your side secur him
perhap just at present he may be undecided; the small
of your fortun may make him hang back; hi friend
may all advis him against it but some of those littl
attent and encourag which ladi can so easili
give will fix him in spite of himself and there can be
no reason whi you should not tri for him it is not to be
suppos that ani prior attach on your side--in short
you know as to an attach of that kind it is quit
out of the question the object are insurmountable--
you have too much sens not to see all that colonel brandon
must be the man; and no civil shall be want on
my part to make him pleas with you and your famili
it is a match that must give univers satisfact
in short it is a kind of thing that--low hi voic
to an import whisper--wil be exceedingli welcom
to all parti recollect himself howev he ad
that is i mean to say--your friend are all truli
anxiou to see you well settled; fanni particularli
for she ha your interest veri much at heart i assur you
and her mother too mr ferrar a veri good-natur woman
i am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much
the other day

elinor would not vouchsaf ani answer

it would be someth remark now he continu
someth droll if fanni should have a brother and i
a sister settl at the same time and yet it is not
veri unlik

is mr edward ferrar said elinor with resolut
go to be married?

it is not actual settl but there is such
a thing in agit he ha a most excel mother
mr ferrar with the utmost liber will come forward
and settl on him a thousand a year if the match
take place the ladi is the hon miss morton onli daughter
of the late lord morton with thirti thousand pound
a veri desir connect on both side and i have not
a doubt of it take place in time a thousand a-year
is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over
for ever; but mr ferrar ha a nobl spirit to give
you anoth instanc of her liberality:--th other day
as soon as we came to town awar that money could
not be veri plenti with us just now she put bank-not
into fanni hand to the amount of two hundr pound
and extrem accept it is for we must live at a great
expens while we are here

he paus for her assent and compassion; and she
forc herself to say

your expens both in town and countri must certainli
be considerable; but your incom is a larg one

not so larg i dare say as mani peopl suppos
i do not mean to complain however; it is undoubtedli
a comfort one and i hope will in time be better
the enclosur of norland common now carri on
is a most seriou drain and then i have made a littl
purchas within thi half year; east kingham farm
you must rememb the place where old gibson use to live
the land wa so veri desir for me in everi respect
so immedi adjoin my own properti that i felt it
my duti to buy it i could not have answer it to my
conscienc to let it fall into ani other hand a man must
pay for hi convenience; and it ha cost me a vast deal
of money

more than you think it realli and intrins worth

whi i hope not that i might have sold it again
the next day for more than i gave: but with regard to the
purchase-money i might have been veri unfortun indeed;
for the stock were at that time so low that if i had not
happen to have the necessari sum in my banker hand
i must have sold out to veri great loss

elinor could onli smile

other great and inevit expens too we have
had on first come to norland our respect father
as you well know bequeath all the stanhil effect
that remain at norland (and veri valuabl they were)
to your mother far be it from me to repin at hi
do so; he had an undoubt right to dispos of hi
own properti as he chose but in consequ of it
we have been oblig to make larg purchas of linen
china &c to suppli the place of what wa taken away
you may guess after all these expens how veri far we
must be from be rich and how accept mr ferrarss
kind is

certainli said elinor; and assist by her liber
i hope you may yet live to be in easi circumst

anoth year or two may do much toward it
he grave replied; but howev there is still a great
deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanni
green-hous and noth but the plan of the flower-garden
mark out

where is the green-hous to be?

upon the knoll behind the hous the old
walnut tree are all come down to make room for it
it will be a veri fine object from mani part of the park
and the flower-garden will slope down just befor it
and be exceedingli pretti we have clear away all the old
thorn that grew in patch over the brow

elinor kept her concern and her censur to herself;
and wa veri thank that mariann wa not present
to share the provoc

have now said enough to make hi poverti clear
and to do away the necess of buy a pair of ear-r
for each of hi sister in hi next visit at gray
hi thought took a cheerful turn and he began to
congratul elinor on have such a friend as mr jen

she seem a most valuabl woman indeed--h hous
her style of live all bespeak an exceed good income;
and it is an acquaint that ha not onli been
of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove
materi advantageous--h invit you to town is
certainli a vast thing in your favour; and inde it
speak altogeth so great a regard for you that in all
probabl when she die you will not be forgotten--
she must have a great deal to leav

noth at all i should rather suppose; for she ha
onli her jointur which will descend to her children

but it is not to be imagin that she live up to
her incom few peopl of common prudenc will do that;
and whatev she save she will be abl to dispos of

and do you not think it more like that she
should leav it to her daughter than to us?

her daughter are both exceedingli well marri
and therefor i cannot perceiv the necess of her
rememb them farther wherea in my opinion by her
take so much notic of you and treat you in thi
kind of way she ha given you a sort of claim on her
futur consider which a conscienti woman would
not disregard noth can be kinder than her behaviour;
and she can hardli do all thi without be awar
of the expect it rais

but she rais none in those most concern
inde brother your anxieti for our welfar and prosper
carri you too far

whi to be sure said he seem to recollect himself
peopl have littl have veri littl in their power
but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne?--
she look veri unwel ha lost her colour and is grown
quit thin is she ill?

she is not well she ha had a nervou complaint
on her for sever week

i am sorri for that at her time of life
ani thing of an ill destroy the bloom for ever!
her ha been a veri short one! she wa as handsom a girl
last septemb as i ever saw; and as like to attract
the man there wa someth in her style of beauti
to pleas them particularli i rememb fanni use to say
that she would marri sooner and better than you did;
not but what she is exceedingli fond of you but so it
happen to strike her she will be mistaken howev
i question whether mariann now will marri a man worth
more than five or six hundr a-year at the utmost
and i am veri much deceiv if you do not do better
dorsetshire! i know veri littl of dorsetshire; but my dear
elinor i shall be exceedingli glad to know more of it;
and i think i can answer for your have fanni and myself
among the earliest and best pleas of your visitor

elinor tri veri serious to convinc him that
there wa no likelihood of her marri colonel brandon;
but it wa an expect of too much pleasur to himself
to be relinquish and he wa realli resolv on seek
an intimaci with that gentleman and promot the marriag
by everi possibl attent he had just compunct
enough for have done noth for hi sister himself
to be exceedingli anxiou that everybodi els should
do a great deal; and an offer from colonel brandon
or a legaci from mr jen wa the easiest mean
of aton for hi own neglect

they were lucki enough to find ladi middleton
at home and sir john came in befor their visit end
abund of civil pass on all side sir john
wa readi to like anybodi and though mr dashwood did
not seem to know much about hors he soon set him
down as a veri good-natur fellow: while ladi middleton
saw enough of fashion in hi appear to think hi
acquaint worth having; and mr dashwood went away
delight with both

i shall have a charm account to carri
to fanni said he as he walk back with hi sister
ladi middleton is realli a most eleg woman! such
a woman as i am sure fanni will be glad to know
and mr jen too an exceedingli well-behav woman
though not so eleg as her daughter your sister need
not have ani scrupl even of visit her which to say
the truth ha been a littl the case and veri naturally;
for we onli knew that mr jen wa the widow of a man
who had got all hi money in a low way; and fanni and
mr ferrar were both strongli prepossess that neither
she nor her daughter were such kind of women as fanni
would like to associ with but now i can carri her
a most satisfactori account of both



chapter 34


mr john dashwood had so much confid in her
husband judgment that she wait the veri next day
both on mr jen and her daughter; and her
confid wa reward by find even the former
even the woman with whom her sister were stay
by no mean unworthi her notice; and as for ladi middleton
she found her one of the most charm women in the world!

ladi middleton wa equal pleas with mr dashwood
there wa a kind of cold heart selfish on both side
which mutual attract them; and they sympathis
with each other in an insipid proprieti of demeanor
and a gener want of understand

the same manner howev which recommend mr john
dashwood to the good opinion of ladi middleton did not suit
the fanci of mr jen and to her she appear noth
more than a littl proud-look woman of uncordi address
who met her husband sister without ani affect
and almost without have anyth to say to them;
for of the quarter of an hour bestow on berkeley street
she sat at least seven minut and a half in silenc

elinor want veri much to know though she did
not chuse to ask whether edward wa then in town;
but noth would have induc fanni voluntarili
to mention hi name befor her till abl to tell her
that hi marriag with miss morton wa resolv on
or till her husband expect on colonel brandon
were answered; becaus she believ them still so veri
much attach to each other that they could not be too
sedul divid in word and deed on everi occas
the intellig howev which she would not give
soon flow from anoth quarter luci came veri shortli
to claim elinor compass on be unabl to see edward
though he had arriv in town with mr and mr dashwood
he dare not come to bartlett build for fear
of detect and though their mutual impati to meet
wa not to be told they could do noth at present
but write

edward assur them himself of hi be in town
within a veri short time by twice call in berkeley street
twice wa hi card found on the tabl when they return
from their morn engag elinor wa pleas
that he had called; and still more pleas that she had
miss him

the dashwood were so prodigi delight
with the middleton that though not much in the habit
of give anyth they determin to give them--
a dinner; and soon after their acquaint began
invit them to dine in harley street where they had
taken a veri good hous for three month their sister
and mr jen were invit likewis and john dashwood
wa care to secur colonel brandon who alway glad
to be where the miss dashwood were receiv hi eager
civil with some surpris but much more pleasur
they were to meet mr ferrars; but elinor could not learn
whether her son were to be of the parti the expect
of see her howev wa enough to make her interest
in the engagement; for though she could now meet edward
mother without that strong anxieti which had onc promis
to attend such an introduct though she could now see
her with perfect indiffer as to her opinion of herself
her desir of be in compani with mr ferrar
her curios to know what she wa like wa as live as ever

the interest with which she thu anticip the
parti wa soon afterward increas more power
than pleasantli by her hear that the miss steel
were also to be at it

so well had they recommend themselv to ladi middleton
so agreeabl had their assidu made them to her
that though luci wa certainli not so eleg and her
sister not even genteel she wa as readi as sir john
to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street;
and it happen to be particularli conveni to the miss
steel as soon as the dashwood invit wa known
that their visit should begin a few day befor the parti
took place

their claim to the notic of mr john dashwood
as the niec of the gentleman who for mani year had
had the care of her brother might not have done much
howev toward procur them seat at her table;
but as ladi middleton guest they must be welcome; and luci
who had long want to be person known to the famili
to have a nearer view of their charact and her own
difficulti and to have an opportun of endeavour
to pleas them had seldom been happier in her life
than she wa on receiv mr john dashwood card

on elinor it effect wa veri differ she began
immedi to determin that edward who live with
hi mother must be ask as hi mother wa to a parti
given by hi sister; and to see him for the first time
after all that pass in the compani of lucy!--sh hardli
knew how she could bear it!

these apprehens perhap were not found
entir on reason and certainli not at all on truth
they were reliev howev not by her own recollect
but by the good will of luci who believ herself to be
inflict a sever disappoint when she told her
that edward certainli would not be in harley street on tuesday
and even hope to be carri the pain still farther
by persuad her that he wa kept away by the extrem
affect for herself which he could not conceal when they
were togeth

the import tuesday came that wa to introduc
the two young ladi to thi formid mother-in-law

piti me dear miss dashwood! said luci as they
walk up the stair together--for the middleton arriv
so directli after mr jen that they all follow
the servant at the same time--ther is nobodi here but
you that can feel for me--i declar i can hardli stand
good gracious!--in a moment i shall see the person that all
my happi depend on--that is to be my mother!--

elinor could have given her immedi relief
by suggest the possibl of it be miss morton mother
rather than her own whom they were about to behold;
but instead of do that she assur her and with
great sincer that she did piti her--to the utter
amaz of luci who though realli uncomfort herself
hope at least to be an object of irrepress envi to elinor

mr ferrar wa a littl thin woman upright
even to formal in her figur and seriou
even to sour in her aspect her complexion wa sallow;
and her featur small without beauti and natur
without expression; but a lucki contract of the brow
had rescu her counten from the disgrac of insipid
by give it the strong charact of pride and ill natur
she wa not a woman of mani words; for unlik peopl
in gener she proport them to the number of
her ideas; and of the few syllabl that did escap her
not one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eye
with the spirit determin of dislik her at all event

elinor could not now be made unhappi by thi behaviour--
a few month ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it
wa not in mr ferrar power to distress her by it now;--
and the differ of her manner to the miss steel
a differ which seem purpos made to humbl her more
onli amus her she could not but smile to see the gracious
of both mother and daughter toward the veri person--
for luci wa particularli distinguished--whom of all other
had they known as much as she did they would have been most
anxiou to mortify; while she herself who had compar
no power to wound them sat pointedli slight by both
but while she smile at a gracious so misappli
she could not reflect on the mean-spirit folli from
which it sprung nor observ the studi attent
with which the miss steel court it continu
without thoroughli despis them all four

luci wa all exult on be so honor
distinguished; and miss steel want onli to be teaz
about dr davi to be perfectli happi

the dinner wa a grand one the servant were numer
and everi thing bespok the mistresss inclin
for show and the master abil to support it
in spite of the improv and addit which were
make to the norland estat and in spite of it owner
have onc been within some thousand pound of be
oblig to sell out at a loss noth gave ani symptom
of that indig which he had tri to infer from it;--
no poverti of ani kind except of convers appeared--
but there the defici wa consider john dashwood
had not much to say for himself that wa worth hear
and hi wife had still less but there wa no peculiar
disgrac in this; for it wa veri much the case with
the chief of their visitor who almost all labour
under one or other of these disqualif for be
agreeable--w of sens either natur or improved--w
of elegance--w of spirits--or want of temper

when the ladi withdrew to the drawing-room
after dinner thi poverti wa particularli evid
for the gentlemen had suppli the discours with some
variety--th varieti of polit inclos land
and break horses--but then it wa all over; and one
subject onli engag the ladi till coffe came in
which wa the compar height of harri dashwood
and ladi middleton second son william who were nearli
of the same age

had both the children been there the affair might
have been determin too easili by measur them at once;
but as harri onli wa present it wa all conjectur
assert on both sides; and everi bodi had a right to
be equal posit in their opinion and to repeat it
over and over again as often as they like

the parti stood thus:

the two mother though each realli convinc that
her own son wa the tallest polit decid in favour
of the other

the two grandmoth with not less partial
but more sincer were equal earnest in support
of their own descend

luci who wa hardli less anxiou to pleas one parent
than the other thought the boy were both remark tall
for their age and could not conceiv that there could
be the smallest differ in the world between them;
and miss steel with yet greater address gave it
as fast as she could in favour of each

elinor have onc deliv her opinion on
william side by which she offend mr ferrar and
fanni still more did not see the necess of enforc
it by ani farther assertion; and mariann when call
on for her offend them all by declar that she
had no opinion to give as she had never thought about it

befor her remov from norland elinor had paint
a veri pretti pair of screen for her sister-in-law
which be now just mount and brought home
ornament her present draw room; and these screen
catch the eye of john dashwood on hi follow
the other gentlemen into the room were offici
hand by him to colonel brandon for hi admir

these are done by my eldest sister said he; and you
as a man of tast will i dare say be pleas with them
i do not know whether you have ever happen to see ani
of her perform befor but she is in gener reckon
to draw extrem well

the colonel though disclaim all pretens
to connoisseurship warmli admir the screen as he
would have done ani thing paint by miss dashwood;
and on the curios of the other be of cours excit
they were hand round for gener inspect
mr ferrar not awar of their be elinor work
particularli request to look at them; and after they had
receiv gratifi testimoni of ladi middletonss approb
fanni present them to her mother consider inform
her at the same time that they were done by miss dashwood

hum--said mr ferrars--veri pretty--and without
regard them at all return them to her daughter

perhap fanni thought for a moment that her mother
had been quit rude enough--for colour a littl
she immedi said

they are veri pretti maam--ant they? but then again
the dread of have been too civil too encourag herself
probabl came over her for she present ad

do you not think they are someth in miss
morton style of paint maam?--sh doe paint most
delightfully!--how beauti her last landscap is done!

beauti indeed! but she doe everi thing well

mariann could not bear this--sh wa alreadi
greatli displeas with mr ferrars; and such ill-tim
prais of anoth at elinor expens though she
had not ani notion of what wa princip meant by it
provok her immedi to say with warmth

thi is admir of a veri particular kind!--
what is miss morton to us?--who know or who care
for her?--it is elinor of whom we think and speak

and so say she took the screen out of her
sister-in-law hand to admir them herself as they
ought to be admir

mr ferrar look exceedingli angri and draw
herself up more stiffli than ever pronounc in retort
thi bitter philipp miss morton is lord morton daughter

fanni look veri angri too and her husband wa
all in a fright at hi sister audac elinor wa
much more hurt by mariann warmth than she had been
by what produc it; but colonel brandon eye as they
were fix on mariann declar that he notic onli
what wa amiabl in it the affection heart which could
not bear to see a sister slight in the smallest point

mariann feel did not stop here the cold
insol of mr ferrarss gener behaviour to her sister
seem to her to foretel such difficulti and distress
to elinor as her own wound heart taught her to think
of with horror; and urg by a strong impuls of
affection sensibl she move after a moment
to her sister chair and put one arm round her neck
and one cheek close to her said in a low but eager
voic

dear dear elinor dont mind them dont let them
make you unhappi

she could say no more; her spirit were quit overcom
and hide her face on elinor shoulder she burst
into tear everi bodi attent wa call and almost
everi bodi wa concerned--colonel brandon rose up and went
to them without know what he did--mr jen
with a veri intellig ah! poor dear immedi gave
her her salts; and sir john felt so desper enrag
against the author of thi nervou distress that he
instantli chang hi seat to one close by luci steel
and gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole
shock affair

in a few minut howev mariann wa recov
enough to put an end to the bustl and sit down among
the rest; though her spirit retain the impress
of what had pass the whole even

poor marianne! said her brother to colonel brandon
in a low voic as soon as he could secur hi attention--
she ha not such good health as her sister--sh is veri
nervous--sh ha not elinor constitution;--and one must
allow that there is someth veri tri to a young woman
who ha been a beauti in the loss of her person attract
you would not think it perhap but mariann wa remark
handsom a few month ago; quit as handsom as elinor--
now you see it is all gone



chapter 35


elinor curios to see mr ferrar wa satisfied--
she had found in her everi thing that could tend to make
a farther connect between the famili undesirable--
she had seen enough of her pride her mean and her
determin prejudic against herself to comprehend all
the difficulti that must have perplex the engag
and retard the marriag of edward and herself had he been
otherwis free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thank
for her own sake that one greater obstacl preserv her
from suffer under ani other of mr ferrarss creation
preserv her from all depend upon her capric or ani
solicitud for her good opinion or at least if she did not
bring herself quit to rejoic in edward be fetter
to luci she determin that had luci been more amiabl
she ought to have rejoic

she wonder that luci spirit could be so veri much
elev by the civil of mr ferrars;--that her interest
and her vaniti should so veri much blind her as to make
the attent which seem onli paid her becaus she wa
not elinor appear a compliment to herself--or to allow
her to deriv encourag from a prefer onli given her
becaus her real situat wa unknown but that it wa so
had not onli been declar by luci eye at the time
but wa declar over again the next morn more openli
for at her particular desir ladi middleton set her down
in berkeley street on the chanc of see elinor alon
to tell her how happi she wa

the chanc prove a lucki one for a messag from
mr palmer soon after she arriv carri mr jen away

my dear friend cri luci as soon as they were
by themselv i come to talk to you of my happi
could anyth be so flatter as mr ferrarss way
of treat me yesterday? so exceed affabl as she
was!--you know how i dread the thought of see her;--
but the veri moment i wa introduc there wa such an
affabl in her behaviour as realli should seem to say
she had quit took a fanci to me now wa not it so?--
you saw it all; and wa not you quit struck with it?

she wa certainli veri civil to you

civil!--did you see noth but onli civility?--
i saw a vast deal more such kind as fell to the share
of nobodi but me!--no pride no hauteur and your sister
just the same--al sweet and affability!

elinor wish to talk of someth els but luci still
press her to own that she had reason for her happiness;
and elinor wa oblig to go on--

undoubtedli if they had known your engag
said she noth could be more flatter than their
treatment of you;--but as that wa not the case--

i guess you would say so--repli luci
quickly--but there wa no reason in the world whi
mr ferrar should seem to like me if she did not
and her like me is everi thing you shant talk me
out of my satisfact i am sure it will all end well
and there will be no difficulti at all to what i
use to think mr ferrar is a charm woman
and so is your sister they are both delight women
indeed!--i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeabl
mr dashwood was!

to thi elinor had no answer to make and did not
attempt ani

are you ill miss dashwood?--y seem low--you
dont speak;--sur you ant well

i never wa in better health

i am glad of it with all my heart; but realli you did
not look it i should be sorri to have you ill; you that have
been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--heaven
know what i should have done without your friendship--

elinor tri to make a civil answer though doubt
her own success but it seem to satisfi luci for she
directli repli

inde i am perfectli convinc of your regard
for me and next to edward love it is the greatest
comfort i have--poor edward!--but now there is one
good thing we shall be abl to meet and meet pretti often
for ladi middleton delight with mr dashwood
so we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say
and edward spend half hi time with hi sister--besid
ladi middleton and mr ferrar will visit now;--
and mr ferrar and your sister were both so good to say
more than onc they should alway be glad to see me--
they are such charm women!--i am sure if ever you
tell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak
too high

but elinor would not give her ani encourag
to hope that she should tell her sister luci continu

i am sure i should have seen it in a moment
if mr ferrar had took a dislik to me if she had onli
made me a formal courtesi for instanc without say
a word and never after had took ani notic of me
and never look at me in a pleasant way--you know
what i mean--if i had been treat in that forbid
sort of way i should have gave it all up in despair
i could not have stood it for where she doe dislik
i know it is most violent

elinor wa prevent from make ani repli to thi
civil triumph by the door be thrown open the servant
announc mr ferrar and edward immedi walk in

it wa a veri awkward moment; and the counten of each
shew that it wa so they all look exceedingli foolish;
and edward seem to have as great an inclin to walk
out of the room again as to advanc farther into it
the veri circumst in it unpleasantest form
which they would each have been most anxiou to avoid
had fallen on them--they were not onli all three togeth
but were togeth without the relief of ani other person
the ladi recov themselv first it wa not luci
busi to put herself forward and the appear of
secreci must still be kept up she could therefor onli
look her tender and after slightli address him
said no more

but elinor had more to do; and so anxiou wa she
for hi sake and her own to do it well that she
forc herself after a moment recollect
to welcom him with a look and manner that were almost easi
and almost open; and anoth struggl anoth effort still
improv them she would not allow the presenc of luci
nor the conscious of some injustic toward herself
to deter her from say that she wa happi to see him
and that she had veri much regret be from home
when he call befor in berkeley street she would
not be frighten from pay him those attent which
as a friend and almost a relat were hi due by the
observ eye of luci though she soon perceiv them
to be narrowli watch her

her manner gave some re-assur to edward and he
had courag enough to sit down; but hi embarrass still
exceed that of the ladi in a proport which the case
render reason though hi sex might make it rare;
for hi heart had not the indiffer of luci nor
could hi conscienc have quit the eas of elinor

luci with a demur and settl air seem determin
to make no contribut to the comfort of the other
and would not say a word; and almost everi thing that wa
said proceed from elinor who wa oblig to volunt
all the inform about her mother health their come
to town &c which edward ought to have inquir about
but never did

her exert did not stop here; for she soon
afterward felt herself so heroic dispos as
to determin under pretenc of fetch mariann
to leav the other by themselves; and she realli did it
and that in the handsomest manner for she loiter away
sever minut on the landing-plac with the most
high-mind fortitud befor she went to her sister
when that wa onc done howev it wa time for the raptur
of edward to cease; for mariann joy hurri her into
the drawing-room immedi her pleasur in see him
wa like everi other of her feel strong in itself
and strongli spoken she met him with a hand that would
be taken and a voic that express the affect of a sister

dear edward! she cri thi is a moment of great
happiness!--thi would almost make amend for everi thing?

edward tri to return her kind as it deserv
but befor such wit he dare not say half what he
realli felt again they all sat down and for a moment
or two all were silent; while mariann wa look with the
most speak tender sometim at edward and sometim
at elinor regret onli that their delight in each
other should be check by luci unwelcom presenc
edward wa the first to speak and it wa to notic
mariann alter look and express hi fear of her
not find london agre with her

oh dont think of me! she repli with spirit
earnest though her eye were fill with tear
as she spoke dont think of my health elinor is well
you see that must be enough for us both

thi remark wa not calcul to make edward or
elinor more easi nor to concili the good will of luci
who look up at mariann with no veri benign express

do you like london? said edward will to say
ani thing that might introduc anoth subject

not at all i expect much pleasur in it
but i have found none the sight of you edward is the
onli comfort it ha afforded; and thank heaven! you
are what you alway were!

she paused--no one spoke

i think elinor she present ad we must
employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton
in a week or two i suppos we shall be going; and i trust
edward will not be veri unwil to accept the charg

poor edward mutter someth but what it wa
nobodi knew not even himself but mariann who saw
hi agit and could easili trace it to whatev
caus best pleas herself wa perfectli satisfi
and soon talk of someth els

we spent such a day edward in harley street
yesterday! so dull so wretchedli dull!--but i have much
to say to you on that head which cannot be said now

and with thi admir discret did she defer
the assur of her find their mutual rel more
disagre than ever and of her be particularli
disgust with hi mother till they were more in privat

but whi were you not there edward?--whi did you
not come?

i wa engag elsewher

engaged! but what wa that when such friend
were to be met?

perhap miss mariann cri luci eager to take
some reveng on her you think young men never stand
upon engag if they have no mind to keep them
littl as well as great

elinor wa veri angri but mariann seem entir
insens of the sting; for she calmli repli

not so indeed; for serious speak i am veri
sure that conscienc onli kept edward from harley street
and i realli believ he ha the most delic conscienc
in the world; the most scrupul in perform
everi engag howev minut and howev it
may make against hi interest or pleasur he is the
most fear of give pain of wound expect
and the most incap of be selfish of ani bodi
i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it
what! are you never to hear yourself praised!--then you
must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept
of my love and esteem must submit to my open commend

the natur of her commend in the present case
howev happen to be particularli ill-suit to the
feel of two third of her auditor and wa so veri
unexhilar to edward that he veri soon got up to go away

go so soon! said marianne; my dear edward
thi must not be

and draw him a littl asid she whisper
her persuas that luci could not stay much longer
but even thi encourag fail for he would go;
and luci who would have outstaid him had hi visit last
two hour soon afterward went away

what can bring her here so often? said mariann
on her leav them could not she see that we want
her gone!--how teaz to edward!

whi so?--w were all hi friend and luci ha been
the longest known to him of ani it is but natur
that he should like to see her as well as ourselv

mariann look at her steadili and said you know
elinor that thi is a kind of talk which i cannot bear
if you onli hope to have your assert contradict
as i must suppos to be the case you ought to recollect
that i am the last person in the world to do it
i cannot descend to be trick out of assur that are
not realli want

she then left the room; and elinor dare not follow
her to say more for bound as she wa by her promis
of secreci to luci she could give no inform that
would convinc marianne; and pain as the consequ
of her still continu in an error might be she wa
oblig to submit to it all that she could hope wa
that edward would not often expos her or himself to the
distress of hear mariann mistaken warmth nor to the
repetit of ani other part of the pain that had attend
their recent meeting--and thi she had everi reason to expect



chapter 36


within a few day after thi meet the newspap
announc to the world that the ladi of thoma palmer
esq wa safe deliv of a son and heir; a veri
interest and satisfactori paragraph at least to all
those intim connect who knew it befor

thi event highli import to mr jenningss happi
produc a temporari alter in the dispos of her time
and influenc in a like degre the engag
of her young friends; for as she wish to be as much
as possibl with charlott she went thither everi morn
as soon as she wa dress and did not return till late
in the evening; and the miss dashwood at the particular
request of the middleton spent the whole of everi day
in everi day in conduit street for their own comfort
they would much rather have remain at least all
the morn in mr jenningss house; but it wa not
a thing to be urg against the wish of everybodi
their hour were therefor made over to ladi middleton
and the two miss steel by whom their compani in fact
wa as littl valu as it wa professedli sought

they had too much sens to be desir companion
to the former; and by the latter they were consid with
a jealou eye as intrud on their ground and share
the kind which they want to monopol though noth
could be more polit than ladi middleton behaviour to
elinor and mariann she did not realli like them at all
becaus they neither flatter herself nor her children
she could not believ them good-natured; and becaus they
were fond of read she fanci them satirical: perhap
without exactli know what it wa to be satirical;
but that did not signifi it wa censur in common use
and easili given

their presenc wa a restraint both on her and on luci
it check the idl of one and the busi of the other
ladi middleton wa asham of do noth befor them
and the flatteri which luci wa proud to think of
and administ at other time she fear they would despis
her for offer miss steel wa the least discompos
of the three by their presence; and it wa in their power
to reconcil her to it entir would either of them
onli have given her a full and minut account of the whole
affair between mariann and mr willoughbi she would
have thought herself ampli reward for the sacrific
of the best place by the fire after dinner which their
arriv occas but thi concili wa not granted;
for though she often threw out express of piti for her
sister to elinor and more than onc dropt a reflect
on the inconst of beaux befor mariann no effect
wa produc but a look of indiffer from the former
or of disgust in the latter an effort even yet lighter
might have made her their friend would they onli have
laugh at her about the doctor! but so littl were they
anymor than the other inclin to oblig her
that if sir john dine from home she might spend a whole
day without hear ani other railleri on the subject
than what she wa kind enough to bestow on herself

all these jealousi and discont howev were so
total unsuspect by mr jen that she thought
it a delight thing for the girl to be together;
and gener congratul her young friend everi night
on have escap the compani of a stupid old woman so long
she join them sometim at sir john sometim
at her own house; but wherev it wa she alway came
in excel spirit full of delight and import
attribut charlott well do to her own care and readi
to give so exact so minut a detail of her situat
as onli miss steel had curios enough to desir
one thing did disturb her; and of that she made her
daili complaint mr palmer maintain the common
but unfatherli opinion among hi sex of all infant be alike;
and though she could plainli perceiv at differ time
the most strike resembl between thi babi and everi
one of hi relat on both side there wa no convinc
hi father of it; no persuad him to believ that it
wa not exactli like everi other babi of the same age;
nor could he even be brought to acknowledg the simpl
proposit of it be the finest child in the world

i come now to the relat of a misfortun
which about thi time befel mr john dashwood
it so happen that while her two sister with
mr jen were first call on her in harley street
anoth of her acquaint had dropt in--a circumst
in itself not appar like to produc evil to her
but while the imagin of other peopl will carri
them away to form wrong judgment of our conduct
and to decid on it by slight appear one happi
must in some measur be alway at the merci of chanc
in the present instanc thi last-arriv ladi allow
her fanci to so far outrun truth and probabl
that on mere hear the name of the miss dashwood
and understand them to be mr dashwood sister
she immedi conclud them to be stay in harley street;
and thi misconstruct produc within a day
or two afterward card of invit for them
as well as for their brother and sister to a small
music parti at her hous the consequ of which wa
that mr john dashwood wa oblig to submit not onli
to the exceedingli great inconveni of send her
carriag for the miss dashwood but what wa still wors
must be subject to all the unpleas of appear
to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they
might not expect to go out with her a second time? the power
of disappoint them it wa true must alway be her
but that wa not enough; for when peopl are determin
on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel
injur by the expect of ani thing better from them

mariann had now been brought by degre so much
into the habit of go out everi day that it wa becom
a matter of indiffer to her whether she went or not:
and she prepar quietli and mechan for everi
even engag though without expect the smallest
amus from ani and veri often without know
till the last moment where it wa to take her

to her dress and appear she wa grown so perfectli
indiffer as not to bestow half the consider on it
dure the whole of her toilet which it receiv from
miss steel in the first five minut of their be
togeth when it wa finish noth escap her minut
observ and gener curiosity; she saw everi thing
and ask everi thing; wa never easi till she knew the price
of everi part of mariann dress; could have guess the
number of her gown altogeth with better judgment than
mariann herself and wa not without hope of find out
befor they part how much her wash cost per week
and how much she had everi year to spend upon herself
the impertin of these kind of scrutini moreov
wa gener conclud with a compliment which
though meant as it douceur wa consid by mariann
as the greatest impertin of all; for after undergo
an examin into the valu and make of her gown
the colour of her shoe and the arrang of her hair
she wa almost sure of be told that upon her word
she look vastli smart and she dare to say she would
make a great mani conquest

with such encourag as thi wa she dismiss
on the present occas to her brother carriage;
which they were readi to enter five minut after it
stop at the door a punctual not veri agreeabl
to their sister-in-law who had preced them to the hous
of her acquaint and wa there hope for some delay
on their part that might inconveni either herself
or her coachman

the event of thi even were not veri remark
the parti like other music parti comprehend a
great mani peopl who had real tast for the perform
and a great mani more who had none at all; and the perform
themselv were as usual in their own estim
and that of their immedi friend the first privat
perform in england

as elinor wa neither music nor affect to be so
she made no scrupl of turn her eye from the grand
pianofort whenev it suit her and unrestrain even
by the presenc of a harp and violoncello would fix
them at pleasur on ani other object in the room in one
of these excurs glanc she perceiv among a group
of young men the veri he who had given them a lectur
on toothpick-cas at gray she perceiv him soon
afterward look at herself and speak familiarli
to her brother; and had just determin to find out hi
name from the latter when they both came toward her
and mr dashwood introduc him to her as mr robert ferrar

he address her with easi civil and twist
hi head into a bow which assur her as plainli as
word could have done that he wa exactli the coxcomb
she had heard him describ to be by luci happi had
it been for her if her regard for edward had depend
less on hi own merit than on the merit of hi nearest
relations! for then hi brother bow must have given
the finish stroke to what the ill-humour of hi mother
and sister would have begun but while she wonder
at the differ of the two young men she did not find
that the empti of conceit of the one put her out
of all chariti with the modesti and worth of the other
whi they were differ robert exclaim to her himself
in the cours of a quarter of an hour conversation;
for talk of hi brother and lament the extrem
gaucheri which he realli believ kept him from mix
in proper societi he candidli and gener attribut it
much less to ani natur defici than to the misfortun
of a privat education; while he himself though probabl
without ani particular ani materi superior
by natur mere from the advantag of a public school
wa as well fit to mix in the world as ani other man

upon my soul he ad i believ it is noth more;
and so i often tell my mother when she is griev
about it my dear madam i alway say to her you must
make yourself easi the evil is now irremedi
and it ha been entir your own do whi would
you be persuad by my uncl sir robert against your
own judgment to place edward under privat tuition
at the most critic time of hi life? if you had onli sent
him to westminst as well as myself instead of send
him to mr pratt all thi would have been prevent
thi is the way in which i alway consid the matter
and my mother is perfectli convinc of her error

elinor would not oppos hi opinion becaus
whatev might be her gener estim of the advantag
of a public school she could not think of edward
abod in mr pratt famili with ani satisfact

you resid in devonshir i think--wa hi
next observ in a cottag near dawlish

elinor set him right as to it situation;
and it seem rather surpris to him that anybodi
could live in devonshir without live near dawlish
he bestow hi hearti approb howev on their
speci of hous

for my own part said he i am excess fond
of a cottage; there is alway so much comfort so much
eleg about them and i protest if i had ani money
to spare i should buy a littl land and build one myself
within a short distanc of london where i might drive
myself down at ani time and collect a few friend
about me and be happi i advis everi bodi who is go
to build to build a cottag my friend lord courtland
came to me the other day on purpos to ask my advic
and laid befor me three differ plan of bonomi
i wa to decid on the best of them my dear courtland
said i immedi throw them all into the fire do not
adopt either of them but by all mean build a cottag
and that i fanci will be the end of it

some peopl imagin that there can be no accommod
no space in a cottage; but thi is all a mistak
i wa last month at my friend elliott near dartford
ladi elliott wish to give a danc but how can it
be done? said she; my dear ferrar do tell me how it
is to be manag there is not a room in thi cottag
that will hold ten coupl and where can the supper be?
i immedi saw that there could be no difficulti in it
so i said my dear ladi elliott do not be uneasi
the dine parlour will admit eighteen coupl with ease;
card-tabl may be place in the drawing-room; the librari
may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the
supper be set out in the saloon ladi elliott wa delight
with the thought we measur the dining-room and found
it would hold exactli eighteen coupl and the affair
wa arrang precis after my plan so that in fact
you see if peopl do but know how to set about it
everi comfort may be as well enjoy in a cottag
as in the most spaciou dwell

elinor agre to it all for she did not think
he deserv the compliment of ration opposit

as john dashwood had no more pleasur in music than hi
eldest sister hi mind wa equal at liberti to fix on
ani thing else; and a thought struck him dure the even
which he commun to hi wife for her approb
when they got home the consider of mr dennison
mistak
in suppos hi sister their guest had suggest the
proprieti of their be realli invit to becom such
while mr jen engag kept her from home
the expens would be noth the inconveni not more;
and it wa altogeth an attent which the delicaci
of hi conscienc point out to be requisit to it
complet enfranchis from hi promis to hi father
fanni wa startl at the propos

i do not see how it can be done said she
without affront ladi middleton for they spend everi day
with her; otherwis i should be exceedingli glad to do it
you know i am alway readi to pay them ani attent
in my power as my take them out thi even shew
but they are ladi middleton visitor how can i ask them
away from her?

her husband but with great humil did not see
the forc of her object they had alreadi spent a week
in thi manner in conduit street and ladi middleton
could not be displeas at their give the same number
of day to such near relat

fanni paus a moment and then with fresh vigor said

my love i would ask them with all my heart if it
wa in my power but i had just settl within myself
to ask the miss steel to spend a few day with us
they are veri well behav good kind of girls; and i think
the attent is due to them as their uncl did so veri
well by edward we can ask your sister some other year
you know; but the miss steel may not be in town ani more
i am sure you will like them; inde you do like them
you know veri much alreadi and so doe my mother; and they
are such favourit with harry!

mr dashwood wa convinc he saw the necess
of invit the miss steel immedi and hi conscienc
wa pacifi by the resolut of invit hi sister
anoth year; at the same time howev slyli suspect
that anoth year would make the invit needless
by bring elinor to town as colonel brandon wife
and mariann as their visitor

fanni rejoic in her escap and proud of the readi
wit that had procur it wrote the next morn to luci
to request her compani and her sister for some day
in harley street as soon as ladi middleton could spare them
thi wa enough to make luci realli and reason happi
mr dashwood seem actual work for her herself;
cherish all her hope and promot all her views!
such an opportun of be with edward and hi famili wa
abov all thing the most materi to her interest
and such an invit the most gratifi to her
feelings! it wa an advantag that could not be too
grate acknowledg nor too speedili made use of;
and the visit to ladi middleton which had not befor had
ani precis limit wa instantli discov to have been
alway meant to end in two day time

when the note wa shown to elinor as it wa within ten
minut after it arriv it gave her for the first time
some share in the expect of lucy; for such a mark
of uncommon kind vouchsaf on so short an acquaint
seem to declar that the good-wil toward her aros
from someth more than mere malic against herself;
and might be brought by time and address to do
everi thing that luci wish her flatteri had alreadi
subdu the pride of ladi middleton and made an entri
into the close heart of mr john dashwood; and these
were effect that laid open the probabl of greater

the miss steel remov to harley street and all
that reach elinor of their influenc there strengthen
her expect of the event sir john who call on
them more than onc brought home such account of the
favour they were in as must be univers strike
mr dashwood had never been so much pleas with ani
young women in her life as she wa with them; had given
each of them a needl book made by some emigrant;
call luci by her christian name; and did not know
whether she should ever be abl to part with them

chapter 37


mr palmer wa so well at the end of a fortnight
that her mother felt it no longer necessari to give up
the whole of her time to her; and content herself with
visit her onc or twice a day return from that period
to her own home and her own habit in which she found
the miss dashwood veri readi to resum their former share

about the third or fourth morn after their
be thu resettl in berkeley street mr jen
on return from her ordinari visit to mr palmer
enter the drawing-room where elinor wa sit
by herself with an air of such hurri import
as prepar her to hear someth wonderful; and give her
time onli to form that idea began directli to justifi it
by say

lord! my dear miss dashwood! have you heard the news?

no maam what is it?

someth so strange! but you shall hear it all--
when i got to mr palmer i found charlott quit
in a fuss about the child she wa sure it wa veri
ill--it cri and fret and wa all over pimpl
so i look at it directli and lord! my dear
say i it is noth in the world but the red gum--
and nurs said just the same but charlott she would
not be satisfi so mr donavan wa sent for; and luckili
he happen to just come in from harley street so he
step over directli and as soon as ever he saw the child
be said just as we did that it wa noth in the world
but the red gum and then charlott wa easi and so
just as he wa go away again it came into my head
i am sure i do not know how i happen to think of it
but it came into my head to ask him if there wa ani news
so upon that he smirk and simper and look grave
and seem to know someth or other and at last he
said in a whisper for fear ani unpleas report
should reach the young ladi under your care as to their
sister indisposit i think it advis to say
that i believ there is no great reason for alarm; i hope
mr dashwood will do veri well

what! is fanni ill?

that is exactli what i said my dear lord! say i
is mr dashwood ill? so then it all came out; and the
long and the short of the matter by all i can learn
seem to be thi mr edward ferrar the veri young
man i use to joke with you about (but howev as it
turn out i am monstrou glad there wa never ani thing
in it) mr edward ferrar it seem ha been engag
abov thi twelvemonth to my cousin lucy!--ther for you
my dear!--and not a creatur know a syllabl of the matter
except nancy!--could you have believ such a thing possible?--
there is no great wonder in their like one another;
but that matter should be brought so forward between them
and nobodi suspect it!--that is strange!--i never happen
to see them togeth or i am sure i should have found it
out directli well and so thi wa kept a great secret
for fear of mr ferrar and neither she nor your
brother or sister suspect a word of the matter;--
till thi veri morn poor nanci who you know is a
well-mean creatur but no conjur popt it all out
lord! think she to herself they are all so fond
of luci to be sure they will make no difficulti about it;
and so away she went to your sister who wa sit all
alon at her carpet-work littl suspect what wa to
come--for she had just been say to your brother onli five
minut befor that she thought to make a match between
edward and some lord daughter or other i forget who
so you may think what a blow it wa to all her vaniti
and pride she fell into violent hyster immedi
with such scream as reach your brother ear
as he wa sit in hi own dressing-room down stair
think about write a letter to hi steward in the countri
so up he flew directli and a terribl scene took place
for luci wa come to them by that time littl dream
what wa go on poor soul! i piti her and i must say
i think she wa use veri hardly; for your sister scold
like ani furi and soon drove her into a faint fit
nanci she fell upon her knee and cri bitterly;
and your brother he walk about the room and said
he did not know what to do mr dashwood declar
they should not stay a minut longer in the hous
and your brother wa forc to go down upon hi knee too
to persuad her to let them stay till they had pack
up their cloth then she fell into hyster again
and he wa so frighten that he would send for mr donavan
and mr donavan found the hous in all thi uproar
the carriag wa at the door readi to take my poor
cousin away and they were just step in as he
came off; poor luci in such a condit he say
she could hardli walk; and nanci she wa almost as bad
i declar i have no patienc with your sister; and i hope
with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her
lord! what a take poor mr edward will be in when he
hear of it! to have hi love use so scornfully! for
they say he is monstrou fond of her as well he may
i should not wonder if he wa to be in the greatest
passion!--and mr donavan think just the same he and i
had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is
that he is gone back again to harley street that he may
be within call when mr ferrar is told of it for she
wa sent for as soon as ever my cousin left the hous
for your sister wa sure she would be in hyster too;
and so she may for what i care i have no piti for
either of them i have no notion of peopl make
such a to-do about money and great there is no
reason on earth whi mr edward and luci should not marry;
for i am sure mr ferrar may afford to do veri well
by her son and though luci ha next to noth herself
she know better than ani bodi how to make the most
of everi thing; i dare say if mr ferrar would onli
allow him five hundr a-year she would make as good
an appear with it as ani bodi els would with eight
lord! how snug they might live in such anoth cottag
as yours--or a littl bigger--with two maid and two men;
and i believ i could help them to a housemaid for my
betti ha a sister out of place that would fit them
exactli

here mr jen ceas and as elinor had had
time enough to collect her thought she wa abl
to give such an answer and make such observ
as the subject might natur be suppos to produc
happi to find that she wa not suspect of ani extraordinari
interest in it; that mr jen (a she had of late
often hope might be the case) had ceas to imagin her
at all attach to edward; and happi abov all the rest
in the absenc of mariann she felt veri well abl
to speak of the affair without embarrass and to
give her judgment as she believ with imparti
on the conduct of everi one concern in it

she could hardli determin what her own expect
of it event realli was; though she earnestli tri
to drive away the notion of it be possibl to end
otherwis at last than in the marriag of edward and luci
what mr ferrar would say and do though there could
not be a doubt of it natur she wa anxiou to hear;
and still more anxiou to know how edward would
conduct himself for him she felt much compassion;--
for luci veri little--and it cost her some pain to procur
that little;--for the rest of the parti none at all

as mr jen could talk on no other subject
elinor soon saw the necess of prepar mariann for
it discuss no time wa to be lost in undeceiv her
in make her acquaint with the real truth and in
endeavour to bring her to hear it talk of by other
without betray that she felt ani uneasi for her sister
or ani resent against edward

elinor offic wa a pain one--sh wa go
to remov what she realli believ to be her sister
chief consolation--to give such particular of edward as she
fear would ruin him for ever in her good opinion-and
to make mariann by a resembl in their situat
which to her fanci would seem strong feel all her own
disappoint over again but unwelcom as such a task
must be it wa necessari to be done and elinor therefor
hasten to perform it

she wa veri far from wish to dwell on her own
feel or to repres herself as suffer much
ani otherwis than as the self-command she had practis
sinc her first knowledg of edward engag might
suggest a hint of what wa practic to mariann
her narrat wa clear and simple; and though it could
not be given without emot it wa not accompani
by violent agit nor impetu grief--that belong
rather to the hearer for mariann listen with horror
and cri excess elinor wa to be the comfort
of other in her own distress no less than in theirs;
and all the comfort that could be given by assur
of her own composur of mind and a veri earnest
vindic of edward from everi charg but of imprud
wa readili offer

but mariann for some time would give credit to neither
edward seem a second willoughby; and acknowledg
as elinor did that she had love him most sincer
could she feel less than herself! as for luci steel
she consid her so total unami so absolut
incap of attach a sensibl man that she could
not be persuad at first to believ and afterward
to pardon ani former affect of edward for her
she would not even admit it to have been natural;
and elinor left her to be convinc that it wa so
by that which onli could convinc her a better knowledg
of mankind

her first commun had reach no farther than
to state the fact of the engag and the length of time
it had existed--mariann feel had then broken in
and put an end to all regular of detail; and for some
time all that could be done wa to sooth her distress
lessen her alarm and combat her resent the first
question on her side which led to farther particular
wa

how long ha thi been known to you elinor? ha
he written to you?

i have known it these four month when luci
first came to barton park last novemb she told me
in confid of her engag

at these word mariann eye express the astonish
which her lip could not utter after a paus of wonder
she exclaimed--

four months!--hav you known of thi four months?

elinor confirm it

what!--whil attend me in all my miseri ha thi
been on your heart?--and i have reproach you for be
happy!--

it wa not fit that you should then know how much
i wa the reverse!

four months!--cri mariann again--so calm!--
so cheerful!--how have you been supported?--

by feel that i wa do my duty--mi promis to
luci oblig me to be secret i owe it to her therefor
to avoid give ani hint of the truth; and i owe it to my
famili and friend not to creat in them a solicitud about me
which it could not be in my power to satisfi

mariann seem much struck

i have veri often wish to undec yourself and my
mother ad elinor; and onc or twice i have attempt it;--
but without betray my trust i never could have convinc
you

four months!--and yet you love him!--

ye but i did not love onli him;--and while the comfort
of other wa dear to me i wa glad to spare them from know
how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with
littl emot i would not have you suffer on my account;
for i assur you i no longer suffer materi myself
i have mani thing to support me i am not consciou of have
provok the disappoint by ani imprud of my own
i have born it as much as possibl without spread
it farther i acquit edward of essenti misconduct
i wish him veri happy; and i am so sure of hi alway
do hi duti that though now he may harbour some regret
in the end he must becom so luci doe not want sens
and that is the foundat on which everi thing good may
be built--and after all mariann after all that is
bewitch in the idea of a singl and constant attach
and all that can be said of one happi depend
entir on ani particular person it is not meant--it
is not fit--it is not possibl that it should be so--
edward will marri lucy; he will marri a woman superior
in person and understand to half her sex; and time
and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought
anoth superior to her--

if such is your way of think said mariann
if the loss of what is most valu is so easili
to be made up by someth els your resolut
your self-command are perhap a littl less to be
wonder at--they are brought more within my comprehens

i understand you--you do not suppos that i have ever
felt much--for four month mariann i have had all thi
hang on my mind without be at liberti to speak
of it to a singl creature; know that it would make
you and my mother most unhappi whenev it were explain
to you yet unabl to prepar you for it in the least--
it wa told me--it wa in a manner forc on me by the
veri person herself whose prior engag ruin all
my prospects; and told me as i thought with triumph--
thi person suspicion therefor i have had to oppos
by endeavour to appear indiffer where i have been most
deepli interested;--and it ha not been onli once;--i have
had her hope and exult to listen to again and again--
i have known myself to be divid from edward for ever
without hear one circumst that could make me less
desir the connection--noth ha prove him unworthy;
nor ha anyth declar him indiffer to me--
i have had to contend against the unkind of hi sister
and the insol of hi mother; and have suffer the
punish of an attach without enjoy it advantages--
and all thi ha been go on at a time when as you
know too well it ha not been my onli unhappiness--
if you can think me capabl of ever feeling--sur you
may suppos that i have suffer now the composur
of mind with which i have brought myself at present
to consid the matter the consol that i have been
will to admit have been the effect of constant and
pain exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--
they did not occur to reliev my spirit at first--
no marianne--then if i had not been bound to silenc
perhap noth could have kept me entirely--not even what i
owe to my dearest friends--from openli shew that i wa
veri unhappy--

mariann wa quit subdued--

oh! elinor she cri you have made me hate
myself for ever--how barbar have i been to you!--
you who have been my onli comfort who have born with me
in all my miseri who have seem to be onli suffer
for me!--i thi my gratitude?--i thi the onli return i
can make you?--becaus your merit cri out upon myself
i have been tri to do it away

the tenderest caress follow thi confess
in such a frame of mind as she wa now in elinor had
no difficulti in obtain from her whatev promis
she required; and at her request mariann engag
never to speak of the affair to ani one with the least
appear of bitterness;--to meet luci without betray
the smallest increas of dislik to her;--and even to see
edward himself if chanc should bring them togeth
without ani diminut of her usual cordiality--
these were great concessions;--but where mariann felt
that she had injur no repar could be too much
for her to make

she perform her promis of be discreet
to admiration--sh attend to all that mr jen
had to say upon the subject with an unchang complexion
dissent from her in noth and wa heard three
time to say ye maam--sh listen to her prais
of luci with onli move from one chair to anoth
and when mr jen talk of edward affect
it cost her onli a spasm in her throat--such advanc
toward heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal
to ani thing herself

the next morn brought a farther trial of it
in a visit from their brother who came with a most seriou
aspect to talk over the dread affair and bring them
news of hi wife

you have heard i suppos said he with great solemn
as soon as he wa seat of the veri shock discoveri
that took place under our roof yesterday

they all look their assent; it seem too aw
a moment for speech

your sister he continu ha suffer dread
mr ferrar too--in short it ha been a scene of such
complic distress--but i will hope that the storm may
be weather without our be ani of us quit overcom
poor fanny! she wa in hyster all yesterday
but i would not alarm you too much donavan say there
is noth materi to be apprehended; her constitut
is a good one and her resolut equal to ani thing
she ha born it all with the fortitud of an angel!
she say she never shall think well of anybodi again;
and one cannot wonder at it after be so deceived!--
meet with such ingratitud where so much kind
had been shewn so much confid had been placed! it
wa quit out of the benevol of her heart that she
had ask these young women to her house; mere becaus
she thought they deserv some attent were harmless
well-behav girl and would be pleasant companions;
for otherwis we both wish veri much to have invit you
and mariann to be with us while your kind friend there
wa attend her daughter and now to be so rewarded!
i wish with all my heart say poor fanni in her
affection way that we had ask your sister instead
of them

here he stop to be thanked; which be done
he went on

what poor mr ferrar suffer when first fanni
broke it to her is not to be describ while she with
the truest affect had been plan a most elig
connect for him wa it to be suppos that he could
be all the time secretli engag to anoth person!--such
a suspicion could never have enter her head! if she
suspect ani prepossess elsewher it could not be
in that quarter there to be sure said she i might
have thought myself safe she wa quit in an agoni
we consult togeth howev as to what should be done
and at last she determin to send for edward
he came but i am sorri to relat what ensu
all that mr ferrar could say to make him put an end
to the engag assist too as you may well suppos
by my argument and fanni entreati wa of
no avail duti affect everi thing wa disregard
i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeel befor
hi mother explain to him her liber design in case
of hi marri miss morton; told him she would settl on
him the norfolk estat which clear of land-tax bring
in a good thousand a-year; offer even when matter
grew desper to make it twelv hundred; and in opposit
to thi if he still persist in thi low connect
repres to him the certain penuri that must attend
the match hi own two thousand pound she protest
should be hi all; she would never see him again; and so far
would she be from afford him the smallest assist
that if he were to enter into ani profess with a view
of better support she would do all in her power to prevent
him advanc in it

here mariann in an ecstasi of indign
clap her hand togeth and cri graciou god!
can thi be possible!

well may you wonder mariann repli her brother
at the obstinaci which could resist such argument as these
your exclam is veri natur

mariann wa go to retort but she rememb
her promis and forbor

all thi howev he continu wa urg in vain
edward said veri little; but what he did say wa in
the most determin manner noth should prevail on
him to give up hi engag he would stand to it
cost him what it might

then cri mr jen with blunt sincer
no longer abl to be silent he ha act like an honest
man! i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had
done otherwis i should have thought him a rascal
i have some littl concern in the busi as well
as yourself for luci steel is my cousin and i believ
there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one
who more deserv a good husband

john dashwood wa greatli astonished; but hi natur
wa calm not open to provoc and he never wish
to offend anybodi especi anybodi of good fortun
he therefor repli without ani resent

i would by no mean speak disrespect of ani
relat of your madam miss luci steel is i dare say
a veri deserv young woman but in the present case
you know the connect must be imposs
and to have enter into a secret engag with a
young man under her uncl care the son of a woman
especi of such veri larg fortun as mr ferrar
is perhap altogeth a littl extraordinari in short
i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of ani person
whom you have a regard for mr jen we all wish
her extrem happy; and mr ferrarss conduct throughout
the whole ha been such as everi conscienti good mother
in like circumst would adopt it ha been dignifi
and liber edward ha drawn hi own lot and i fear
it will be a bad one

mariann sigh out her similar apprehension;
and elinor heart wrung for the feel of edward
while brave hi mother threat for a woman who could
not reward him

well sir said mr jen and how did it end?

i am sorri to say maam in a most unhappi rupture:--
edward is dismiss for ever from hi mother notic
he left her hous yesterday but where he is gone or whether
he is still in town i do not know; for we of cours can
make no inquiri

poor young man!--and what is to becom of him?

what inde maam! it is a melancholi consider
born to the prospect of such affluence! i cannot conceiv
a situat more deplor the interest of two thousand
pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is ad
the recollect that he might but for hi own folli
within three month have been in the receipt of two
thousand five hundr a-year (for miss morton ha
thirti thousand pounds) i cannot pictur to myself
a more wretch condit we must all feel for him;
and the more so becaus it is total out of our power
to assist him

poor young man! cri mr jen i am sure
he should be veri welcom to bed and board at my house;
and so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit
that he should be live about at hi own charg now
at lodg and tavern

elinor heart thank her for such kind toward edward
though she could not forbear smile at the form of it

if he would onli have done as well by himself
said john dashwood as all hi friend were dispos to do
by him he might now have been in hi proper situat
and would have want for noth but as it is it must
be out of anybodi power to assist him and there is one
thing more prepar against him which must be wors than
all--hi mother ha determin with a veri natur kind
of spirit to settl that estat upon robert immedi
which might have been edward on proper condit
i left her thi morn with her lawyer talk over
the busi

well! said mr jen that is her reveng
everybodi ha a way of their own but i dont think mine
would be to make one son independ becaus anoth had
plagu me

mariann got up and walk about the room

can anyth be more gall to the spirit of a man
continu john than to see hi younger brother in
possess of an estat which might have been hi own?
poor edward! i feel for him sincer

a few minut more spent in the same kind of effus
conclud hi visit; and with repeat assur to hi
sister that he realli believ there wa no materi
danger in fanni indisposit and that they need
not therefor be veri uneasi about it he went away;
leav the three ladi unanim in their sentiment
on the present occas as far at least as it regard
mr ferrarss conduct the dashwood and edward

mariann indign burst forth as soon as he
quit the room; and as her vehem made reserv
imposs in elinor and unnecessari in mr jen
they all join in a veri spirit critiqu upon the parti



chapter 38


mr jen wa veri warm in her prais of edward
conduct but onli elinor and mariann understood it
true merit they onli knew how littl he had had to tempt
him to be disobedi and how small wa the consol
beyond the conscious of do right that could
remain to him in the loss of friend and fortun
elinor glori in hi integrity; and mariann forgav all
hi offenc in compass for hi punish but though
confid between them wa by thi public discoveri
restor to it proper state it wa not a subject on
which either of them were fond of dwell when alon
elinor avoid it upon principl as tend to fix still
more upon her thought by the too warm too posit
assur of mariann that belief of edward continu
affect for herself which she rather wish to do away;
and mariann courag soon fail her in tri
to convers upon a topic which alway left her more
dissatisfi with herself than ever by the comparison
it necessarili produc between elinor conduct and her own

she felt all the forc of that comparison; but not
as her sister had hope to urg her to exert now;
she felt it with all the pain of continu self-reproach
regret most bitterli that she had never exert
herself before; but it brought onli the tortur of penit
without the hope of amend her mind wa so much weaken
that she still fanci present exert imposs
and therefor it onli dispirit her more

noth new wa heard by them for a day or two afterward
of affair in harley street or bartlett build
but though so much of the matter wa known to them alreadi
that mr jen might have had enough to do in spread
that knowledg farther without seek after more
she had resolv from the first to pay a visit of comfort
and inquiri to her cousin as soon as she could;
and noth but the hindranc of more visitor than usual
had prevent her go to them within that time

the third day succeed their knowledg of the
particular wa so fine so beauti a sunday as to draw
mani to kensington garden though it wa onli the second
week in march mr jen and elinor were of the number;
but mariann who knew that the willoughbi were again
in town and had a constant dread of meet them
chose rather to stay at home than ventur into so public
a place

an intim acquaint of mr jen join
them soon after they enter the garden and elinor wa
not sorri that by her continu with them and engag
all mr jenningss convers she wa herself left
to quiet reflect she saw noth of the willoughbi
noth of edward and for some time noth of anybodi
who could by ani chanc whether grave or gay be interest
to her but at last she found herself with some surpris
accost by miss steel who though look rather shi
express great satisfact in meet them and on receiv
encourag from the particular kind of mr jen
left her own parti for a short time to join their
mr jen immedi whisper to elinor

get it all out of her my dear she will tell you
ani thing if you ask you see i cannot leav mr clark

it wa lucki howev for mr jenningss curios
and elinor too that she would tell ani thing without
be asked; for noth would otherwis have been learnt

i am so glad to meet you; said miss steel
take her familiarli by the arm--for i want to see you
of all thing in the world and then lower her voic
i suppos mr jen ha heard all about it
is she angry?

not at all i believ with you

that is a good thing and ladi middleton is she angry?

i cannot suppos it possibl that she should

i am monstrou glad of it good gracious! i have
had such a time of it! i never saw luci in such a rage
in my life she vow at first she would never trim me
up a new bonnet nor do ani thing els for me again
so long as she lived; but now she is quit come to
and we are as good friend as ever look she made me
thi bow to my hat and put in the feather last night
there now you are go to laugh at me too but whi
should not i wear pink ribbons? i do not care if it is
the doctor favourit colour i am sure for my part
i should never have known he did like it better than
ani other colour if he had not happen to say so
my cousin have been so plagu me! i declar sometim
i do not know which way to look befor them

she had wander away to a subject on which elinor
had noth to say and therefor soon judg it expedi
to find her way back again to the first

well but miss dashwood speak triumphantli
peopl may say what they chuse about mr ferrarss
declar he would not have luci for it is no such thing
i can tell you; and it is quit a shame for such ill-natur
report to be spread abroad whatev luci might think
about it herself you know it wa no busi of other
peopl to set it down for certain

i never heard ani thing of the kind hint at befor
i assur you said elinor

oh did not you? but it wa said i know veri well
and by more than one; for miss godbi told miss spark
that nobodi in their sens could expect mr ferrar
to give up a woman like miss morton with thirti thousand
pound to her fortun for luci steel that had
noth at all; and i had it from miss spark myself
and besid that my cousin richard said himself
that when it came to the point he wa afraid mr ferrar
would be off; and when edward did not come near us
for three day i could not tell what to think myself;
and i believ in my heart luci gave it up all for lost;
for we came away from your brother wednesday
and we saw noth of him not all thursday friday
and saturday and did not know what wa becom of him
onc luci thought to write to him but then her spirit
rose against that howev thi morn he came just
as we came home from church; and then it all came out
how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street
and been talk to by hi mother and all of them
and how he had declar befor them all that he love
nobodi but luci and nobodi but luci would he have
and how he had been so worri by what pass
that as soon as he had went away from hi mother hous
he had got upon hi hors and rid into the countri
some where or other; and how he had stay about at an inn
all thursday and friday on purpos to get the better
of it and after think it all over and over again
he said it seem to him as if now he had no fortun
and no noth at all it would be quit unkind to keep
her on to the engag becaus it must be for her loss
for he had noth but two thousand pound and no hope
of ani thing else; and if he wa to go into order
as he had some thought he could get noth but a curaci
and how wa they to live upon that?--h could not bear
to think of her do no better and so he beg
if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the
matter directli and leav him shift for himself
i heard him say all thi as plain as could possibl be
and it wa entir for her sake and upon her account
that he said a word about be off and not upon hi own
i will take my oath he never dropt a syllabl of be
tire of her or of wish to marri miss morton or ani
thing like it but to be sure luci would not give
ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directli
(with a great deal about sweet and love you know
and all that--oh la! one cant repeat such kind of thing
you know)--sh told him directli she had not the least
mind in the world to be off for she could live with him
upon a trifl and how littl so ever he might have
she should be veri glad to have it all you know
or someth of the kind so then he wa monstrou happi
and talk on some time about what they should do
and they agre he should take order directli
and they must wait to be marri till he got a live
and just then i could not hear ani more for my cousin
call from below to tell me mr richardson wa come in
her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens;
so i wa forc to go into the room and interrupt them
to ask luci if she would like to go but she did not
care to leav edward; so i just run up stair and put
on a pair of silk stock and came off with the richardson

i do not understand what you mean by interrupt them
said elinor; you were all in the same room togeth
were not you?

no inde not us la! miss dashwood do you
think peopl make love when ani bodi els is by? oh
for shame!--to be sure you must know better than that
(laugh affectedly)--no no; they were shut up in the
drawing-room togeth and all i heard wa onli by listen
at the door

how! cri elinor; have you been repeat to me
what you onli learnt yourself by listen at the door?
i am sorri i did not know it before; for i certainli
would not have suffer you to give me particular of a
convers which you ought not to have known yourself
how could you behav so unfairli by your sister?

oh la! there is noth in that i onli stood at
the door and heard what i could and i am sure luci would
have done just the same by me; for a year or two back
when martha sharp and i had so mani secret togeth
she never made ani bone of hide in a closet or behind
a chimney-board on purpos to hear what we said

elinor tri to talk of someth else; but miss
steel could not be kept beyond a coupl of minut
from what wa uppermost in her mind

edward talk of go to oxford soon said she;
but now he is lodg at no -- pall mall what an
ill-natur woman hi mother is ant she? and your
brother and sister were not veri kind! howev
i shant say anyth against them to you; and to be sure
they did send us home in their own chariot which
wa more than i look for and for my part i wa all
in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the
huswif she had gave us a day or two before; but howev
noth wa said about them and i took care to keep mine
out of sight edward have got some busi at oxford
he says; so he must go there for a time; and after that
as soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordain
i wonder what curaci he will get!--good gracious!
(giggl as she spoke) id lay my life i know what
my cousin will say when they hear of it they will
tell me i should write to the doctor to get edward
the curaci of hi new live i know they will; but i am
sure i would not do such a thing for all the world--
la! i shall say directli i wonder how you could think
of such a thing? i write to the doctor indeed!

well said elinor it is a comfort to be prepar
against the worst you have got your answer readi

miss steel wa go to repli on the same subject
but the approach of her own parti made anoth more necessari

oh la! here come the richardson i had a vast deal
more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not
ani longer i assur you they are veri genteel peopl
he make a monstrou deal of money and they keep their
own coach i have not time to speak to mr jen about
it myself but pray tell her i am quit happi to hear she
is not in anger against us and ladi middleton the same;
and if anyth should happen to take you and your
sister away and mr jen should want compani
i am sure we should be veri glad to come and stay with her
for as long a time as she like i suppos ladi middleton
wont ask us ani more thi bout good-by; i am sorri
miss mariann wa not here rememb me kindli to her
la! if you have not got your spot muslin on!--i wonder
you wa not afraid of it be torn

such wa her part concern; for after thi she had
time onli to pay her farewel compliment to mr jen
befor her compani wa claim by mr richardson;
and elinor wa left in possess of knowledg which
might feed her power of reflect some time though she
had learnt veri littl more than what had been alreadi
foreseen and foreplan in her own mind edward marriag
with luci wa as firmli determin on and the time
of it take place remain as absolut uncertain
as she had conclud it would be;--everi thing depend
exactli after her expect on hi get that prefer
of which at present there seem not the smallest chanc

as soon as they return to the carriag
mr jen wa eager for information; but as elinor
wish to spread as littl as possibl intellig
that had in the first place been so unfairli obtain
she confin herself to the brief repetit of such
simpl particular as she felt assur that luci
for the sake of her own consequ would choos
to have known the continu of their engag
and the mean that were abl to be taken for promot
it end wa all her communication; and thi produc
from mr jen the follow natur remark

wait for hi have a living!--ay we all know how
that will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth and find
no good come of it will set down upon a curaci of fifti
pound a-year with the interest of hi two thousand pound
and what littl matter mr steel and mr pratt can
give her--then they will have a child everi year! and
lord help em! how poor they will be!--i must see
what i can give them toward furnish their hous
two maid and two men indeed!--a i talk of tother
day--no no they must get a stout girl of all works--
betti sister would never do for them now

the next morn brought elinor a letter by the
two-penni post from luci herself it wa as follows:

bartlett build march

i hope my dear miss dashwood will excus the
liberti i take of write to her; but i know your
friendship for me will make you pleas to hear such
a good account of myself and my dear edward after
all the troubl we have went through late
therefor will make no more apolog but proceed
to say that thank god! though we have suffer
dread we are both quit well now and as happi
as we must alway be in one anoth love we have
had great trial and great persecut but
howev at the same time grate acknowledg
mani friend yourself not the least among them
whose great kind i shall alway thank
rememb as will edward too who i have told of
it i am sure you will be glad to hear as likewis
dear mr jen i spent two happi hour with
him yesterday afternoon he would not hear of our
part though earnestli did i as i thought my
duti requir urg him to it for prudenc sake
and would have part for ever on the spot would
he consent to it; but he said it should never be
he did not regard hi mother anger while he could
have my affections; our prospect are not veri
bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for
the best; he will be ordain shortly; and should
it ever be in your power to recommend him to ani
bodi that ha a live to bestow am veri sure you
will not forget us and dear mr jen too
trust she will speak a good word for us to sir john
or mr palmer or ani friend that may be abl to
assist us--poor ann wa much to blame for what
she did but she did it for the best so i say
nothing; hope mr jen wont think it too much
troubl to give us a call should she come thi way
ani morn twould be a great kind and my
cousin would be proud to know her--mi paper remind
me to conclude; and beg to be most grate
and respect rememb to her and to sir john
and ladi middleton and the dear children when you

i am &c

as soon as elinor had finish it she perform
what she conclud to be it writer real design
by place it in the hand of mr jen who read it
aloud with mani comment of satisfact and prais

veri well indeed!--how prettili she writes!--ay
that wa quit proper to let him be off if he would
that wa just like lucy--poor soul! i wish i could get
him a live with all my heart--sh call me dear

as ever lived--veri well upon my word that sentenc
is veri prettili turn ye ye i will go and see her
sure enough how attent she is to think of everi
body!--thank you my dear for shew it me it is
as pretti a letter as ever i saw and doe luci head
and heart great credit



chapter 39


the miss dashwood had now been rather more than
two month in town and mariann impati to be gone
increas everi day she sigh for the air the liberti
the quiet of the country; and fanci that if ani place
could give her eas barton must do it elinor wa hardli
less anxiou than herself for their remov and onli so much
less bent on it be effect immedi as that she
wa consciou of the difficulti of so long a journey
which mariann could not be brought to acknowledg
she began howev serious to turn her thought toward
it accomplish and had alreadi mention their wish
to their kind hostess who resist them with all the
eloqu of her good-wil when a plan wa suggest
which though detain them from home yet a few week
longer appear to elinor altogeth much more elig
than ani other the palmer were to remov to cleveland
about the end of march for the easter holidays;
and mr jen with both her friend receiv a veri
warm invit from charlott to go with them thi would
not in itself have been suffici for the delicaci of
miss dashwood;--but it wa inforc with so much real
polit by mr palmer himself as join to the veri
great amend of hi manner toward them sinc her
sister had been known to be unhappi induc her to accept
it with pleasur

when she told mariann what she had done howev
her first repli wa not veri auspici

cleveland!--sh cri with great agit
no i cannot go to cleveland--

you forget said elinor gentli that it situat
is notthat it is not in the neighbourhood of

but it is in somersetshire--i cannot go
into somersetshire--ther where i look forward
to goingno elinor you cannot expect me to go there

elinor would not argu upon the proprieti of overcom
such feelings;--sh onli endeavour to counteract them by
work on others;--repres it therefor as a measur
which would fix the time of her return to that dear mother
whom she so much wish to see in a more elig
more comfort manner than ani other plan could do
and perhap without ani greater delay from cleveland
which wa within a few mile of bristol the distanc to
barton wa not beyond one day though a long day journey;
and their mother servant might easili come there to attend
them down; and as there could be no occas of their
stay abov a week at cleveland they might now be at
home in littl more than three week time as mariann
affect for her mother wa sincer it must triumph
with littl difficulti over the imaginari evil she had start

mr jen wa so far from be weari of her guest
that she press them veri earnestli to return with her again
from cleveland elinor wa grate for the attent
but it could not alter her design; and their mother
concurr be readili gain everi thing rel
to their return wa arrang as far as it could be;--
and mariann found some relief in draw up a statement
of the hour that were yet to divid her from barton

ah! colonel i do not know what you and i shall
do without the miss dashwoods;--wa mr jenningss
address to him when he first call on her after their
leav her wa settled--for they are quit resolv
upon go home from the palmers;--and how forlorn we
shall be when i come back!--lord! we shall sit and gape
at one anoth as dull as two cat

perhap mr jen wa in hope by thi vigor
sketch of their futur ennui to provok him to make
that offer which might give himself an escap from it;--
and if so she had soon afterward good reason to think
her object gained; for on elinor move to the window
to take more expediti the dimens of a print
which she wa go to copi for her friend he follow
her to it with a look of particular mean and convers
with her there for sever minut the effect of hi
discours on the ladi too could not escap her observ
for though she wa too honor to listen and had even
chang her seat on purpos that she might not hear
to one close by the piano fort on which mariann
wa play she could not keep herself from see
that elinor chang colour attend with agit
and wa too intent on what he said to pursu her employment--
still farther in confirm of her hope in the interv
of mariann turn from one lesson to anoth
some word of the colonel inevit reach her ear
in which he seem to be apologis for the bad
of hi hous thi set the matter beyond a doubt
she wonder inde at hi think it necessari
to do so; but suppos it to be the proper etiquett
what elinor said in repli she could not distinguish
but judg from the motion of her lip that she did
not think that ani materi objection;--and mr jen
commend her in her heart for be so honest
they then talk on for a few minut longer without her
catch a syllabl when anoth lucki stop in mariann
perform brought her these word in the colonel calm voice--

i am afraid it cannot take place veri soon

astonish and shock at so unlover-lik a speech
she wa almost readi to cri out lord! what should
hinder it?--but check her desir confin herself
to thi silent ejacul

thi is veri strange!--sur he need not wait to be older

thi delay on the colonel side howev did not
seem to offend or mortifi hi fair companion in the least
for on their break up the confer soon afterward
and move differ way mr jen veri plainli heard
elinor say and with a voic which shew her to feel what she said

i shall alway think myself veri much oblig to you

mr jen wa delight with her gratitud
and onli wonder that after hear such a sentenc
the colonel should be abl to take leav of them as he
immedi did with the utmost sang-froid and go away
without make her ani reply!--sh had not thought her old
friend could have made so indiffer a suitor

what had realli pass between them wa to thi effect

i have heard said he with great compass
of the injustic your friend mr ferrar ha suffer
from hi family; for if i understand the matter right
he ha been entir cast off by them for persev
in hi engag with a veri deserv young woman--
have i been rightli informed?--i it so?--

elinor told him that it wa

the cruelti the impolit cruelty--h repli
with great feeling--of divid or attempt to divid
two young peopl long attach to each other is terrible--
mr ferrar doe not know what she may be doing--what
she may drive her son to i have seen mr ferrar two
or three time in harley street and am much pleas
with him he is not a young man with whom one can
be intim acquaint in a short time but i have
seen enough of him to wish him well for hi own sake
and as a friend of your i wish it still more
i understand that he intend to take order will you
be so good as to tell him that the live of delaford
now just vacant as i am inform by thi day post
is hi if he think it worth hi acceptance--but that
perhap so unfortun circumstanc as he is now
it may be nonsens to appear to doubt; i onli wish it
were more valuable-- it is a rectori but a small one;
the late incumb i believ did not make more than
200 l per annum and though it is certainli capabl
of improv i fear not to such an amount as
to afford him a veri comfort incom such as it is
howev my pleasur in present him to it
will be veri great pray assur him of it

elinor astonish at thi commiss could
hardli have been greater had the colonel been realli
make her an offer of hi hand the prefer
which onli two day befor she had consid as hopeless
for edward wa alreadi provid to enabl him to marry;--
and she of all peopl in the world wa fix on to
bestow it!--her emot wa such as mr jen had
attribut to a veri differ cause;--but whatev minor
feel less pure less pleas might have a share
in that emot her esteem for the gener benevol
and her gratitud for the particular friendship
which togeth prompt colonel brandon to thi act
were strongli felt and warmli express she thank him
for it with all her heart spoke of edward principl and
disposit with that prais which she knew them to deserve;
and promis to undertak the commiss with pleasur
if it were realli hi wish to put off so agreeabl an offic
to anoth but at the same time she could not help
think that no one could so well perform it as himself
it wa an offic in short from which unwil to give
edward the pain of receiv an oblig from her
she would have been veri glad to be spare herself;--
but colonel brandon on motiv of equal delicaci
declin it likewis still seem so desir of it be
given through her mean that she would not on ani account
make farther opposit edward she believ wa still in
town
and fortun she had heard hi address from miss steel
she could undertak therefor to inform him of it
in the cours of the day after thi had been settl
colonel brandon began to talk of hi own advantag
in secur so respect and agreeabl a neighbour
and then it wa that he mention with regret that the
hous wa small and indifferent;--an evil which elinor
as mr jen had suppos her to do made veri light of
at least as far as regard it size

the small of the hous said she
i cannot imagin ani inconveni to them
for it will be in proport to their famili and incom

by which the colonel wa surpris to find that she
wa consid mr ferrarss marriag as the certain
consequ of the presentation; for he did not suppos it
possibl that delaford live could suppli such an incom
as anybodi in hi style of life would ventur to settl on--
and he said so

thi littl rectori can do no more than make mr ferrar
comfort as a bachelor; it cannot enabl him to marri
i am sorri to say that my patronag end with this;
and my interest is hardli more extens if howev
by an unforeseen chanc it should be in my power to serv
him farther i must think veri differ of him
from what i now do if i am not as readi to be use
to him then as i sincer wish i could be at present
what i am now do inde seem noth at all
sinc it can advanc him so littl toward what must
be hi princip hi onli object of happi
hi marriag must still be a distant good;--at least
i am afraid it cannot take place veri soon--

such wa the sentenc which when misunderstood
so justli offend the delic feel of mr jennings;
but after thi narrat of what realli pass between
colonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window
the gratitud express by the latter on their part may
perhap appear in gener not less reason excit
nor less properli word than if it had arisen from
an offer of marriag



chapter 40


well miss dashwood said mr jen
sagaci smile as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn
i do not ask you what the colonel ha been say to you;
for though upon my honour i tri to keep out of hear
i could not help catch enough to understand hi busi
and i assur you i never wa better pleas in my life
and i wish you joy of it with all my heart

thank you maam said elinor it is a matter
of great joy to me; and i feel the good of colonel
brandon most sensibl there are not mani men who would
act as he ha done few peopl who have so compassion
a heart! i never wa more astonish in my life

lord! my dear you are veri modest i ant the least
astonish at it in the world for i have often thought
of late there wa noth more like to happen

you judg from your knowledg of the colonel
gener benevolence; but at least you could not forese
that the opportun would so veri soon occur

opportunity! repeat mr jennings--oh! as to that
when a man ha onc made up hi mind to such a thing
somehow or other he will soon find an opportun
well my dear i wish you joy of it again and again;
and if ever there wa a happi coupl in the world i think
i shall soon know where to look for them

you mean to go to delaford after them i suppos
said elinor with a faint smile

aye my dear that i do inde and as to the hous
be a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at
for it is as good a one as ever i saw

he spoke of it be out of repair

well and whose fault is that? whi dont he repair it?--
who should do it but himself?

they were interrupt by the servant come in to
announc the carriag be at the door; and mr jen
immedi prepar to go said--

well my dear i must be gone befor i have had half
my talk out but howev we may have it all over in
the evening; for we shall be quit alon i do not ask
you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full
of the matter to care for company; and besid you must
long to tell your sister all about it

mariann had left the room befor the convers began

certainli maam i shall tell mariann of it;
but i shall not mention it at present to ani bodi els

oh! veri well said mr jen rather disappoint
then you would not have me tell it to luci for i think
of go as far as holborn to-day

no maam not even luci if you pleas
one day delay will not be veri material; and till i
have written to mr ferrar i think it ought not to be
mention to ani bodi els i shall do that directli
it is of import that no time should be lost with him
for he will of cours have much to do rel to
hi ordin

thi speech at first puzzl mr jen exceedingli
whi mr ferrar wa to have been written to about it
in such a hurri she could not immedi comprehend
a few moment reflect howev produc a veri happi idea
and she exclaimed;--

oh ho!--i understand you mr ferrar is to be
the man well so much the better for him ay to be sure
he must be ordain in readiness; and i am veri glad
to find thing are so forward between you but my dear
is not thi rather out of character? should not the colonel
write himself?--sur he is the proper person

elinor did not quit understand the begin of
mr jenningss speech neither did she think it worth
inquir into; and therefor onli repli to it conclus

colonel brandon is so delic a man that he rather
wish ani one to announc hi intent to mr ferrar
than himself

and so you are forc to do it well that is an odd
kind of delicacy! howev i will not disturb you (see
her prepar to write) you know your own concern best
so goodbi my dear i have not heard of ani thing to
pleas me so well sinc charlott wa brought to bed

and away she went; but return again in a moment

i have just been think of betti sister my dear
i should be veri glad to get her so good a mistress
but whether she would do for a ladi maid i am sure i
cant tell she is an excel housemaid and work
veri well at her needl howev you will think of all
that at your leisur

certainli maam repli elinor not hear
much of what she said and more anxiou to be alon
than to be mistress of the subject

how she should begin--how she should express
herself in her note to edward wa now all her concern
the particular circumst between them made
a difficulti of that which to ani other person would
have been the easiest thing in the world; but she
equal fear to say too much or too littl and sat
deliber over her paper with the pen in her band
till broken in on by the entranc of edward himself

he had met mr jen at the door in her way to
the carriag as he came to leav hi farewel card; and she
after apologis for not return herself had oblig
him to enter by say that miss dashwood wa abov
and want to speak with him on veri particular busi

elinor had just been congratul herself
in the midst of her perplex that howev difficult it
might be to express herself properli by letter it wa
at least prefer to give the inform by word
of mouth when her visitor enter to forc her upon thi
greatest exert of all her astonish and confus
were veri great on hi so sudden appear she had
not seen him befor sinc hi engag becam public
and therefor not sinc hi know her to be acquaint
with it; which with the conscious of what she
had been think of and what she had to tell him
made her feel particularli uncomfort for some minut
he too wa much distressed; and they sat down togeth
in a most promis state of embarrassment--wheth he
had ask her pardon for hi intrus on first come
into the room he could not recollect; but determin
to be on the safe side he made hi apolog in form
as soon as he could say ani thing after take a chair

mr jen told me said he that you wish
to speak with me at least i understood her so--or i
certainli should not have intrud on you in such a manner;
though at the same time i should have been extrem
sorri to leav london without see you and your sister;
especi as it will most like be some time--it
is not probabl that i should soon have the pleasur
of meet you again i go to oxford tomorrow

you would not have gone howev said elinor
recov herself and determin to get over what she
so much dread as soon as possibl without receiv
our good wish even if we had not been abl to give them
in person mr jen wa quit right in what she said
i have someth of consequ to inform you of
which i wa on the point of commun by paper
i am charg with a most agreeabl offic (breath
rather faster than usual as she spoke) colonel brandon
who wa here onli ten minut ago ha desir me to say
that understand you mean to take order he ha
great pleasur in offer you the live of delaford
now just vacant and onli wish it were more valuabl
allow me to congratul you on have so respect
and well-judg a friend and to join in hi wish that
the living--it is about two hundr a-year--wer much
more consider and such as might better enabl you
to--a might be more than a temporari accommod to
yourself--such in short as might establish all your view
of happi

what edward felt as he could not say it himself
it cannot be expect that ani one els should say for him
he look all the astonish which such unexpect
such unthought-of inform could not fail of exciting;
but he said onli these two word

colonel brandon!

ye continu elinor gather more resolut
as some of the worst wa over colonel brandon mean
it as a testimoni of hi concern for what ha late
passed--for the cruel situat in which the unjustifi
conduct of your famili ha place you--a concern
which i am sure mariann myself and all your friend
must share; and likewis as a proof of hi high esteem
for your gener charact and hi particular approb
of your behaviour on the present occas

colonel brandon give me a living!--can it be possible?

the unkind of your own relat ha made you
astonish to find friendship ani where

no repli be with sudden conscious not to
find it in you; for i cannot be ignor that to you
to your good i owe it all--i feel it--i would express
it if i could--but as you well know i am no orat

you are veri much mistaken i do assur you
that you owe it entir at least almost entir
to your own merit and colonel brandon discern
of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know
till i understood hi design that the live wa vacant;
nor had it ever occur to me that he might have
had such a live in hi gift as a friend of mine
of my famili he may perhaps--inde i know he ha
still greater pleasur in bestow it; but upon my word
you owe noth to my solicit

truth oblig her to acknowledg some small share
in the action but she wa at the same time so unwil
to appear as the benefactress of edward that she acknowledg
it with hesitation; which probabl contribut to fix
that suspicion in hi mind which had recent enter it
for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceas
to speak;--at last and as if it were rather an effort he said

colonel brandon seem a man of great worth and respect
i have alway heard him spoken of as such and your brother
i know esteem him highli he is undoubtedli a sensibl man
and in hi manner perfectli the gentleman

inde repli elinor i believ that you will find him
on farther acquaint all that you have heard him to be
and as you will be such veri near neighbour (for i understand
the parsonag is almost close to the mansion-house)
it is particularli import that he should be all thi

edward made no answer; but when she had turn
away her head gave her a look so seriou so earnest
so uncheer as seem to say that he might hereaft wish
the distanc between the parsonag and the mansion-hous
much greater

colonel brandon i think lodg in st jame street
said he soon afterward rise from hi chair

elinor told him the number of the hous

i must hurri away then to give him those thank
which you will not allow me to give you; to assur him
that he ha made me a very--an exceedingli happi man

elinor did not offer to detain him; and they part
with a veri earnest assur on her side of her unceas
good wish for hi happi in everi chang of situat
that might befal him; on hi with rather an attempt to
return the same good will than the power of express it

when i see him again said elinor to herself
as the door shut him out i shall see him the husband
of luci

and with thi pleas anticip she sat down
to reconsid the past recal the word and endeavour
to comprehend all the feel of edward; and of cours
to reflect on her own with discont

when mr jen came home though she return
from see peopl whom she had never seen befor
and of whom therefor she must have a great deal to say
her mind wa so much more occupi by the import secret
in her possess than by anyth els that she
revert to it again as soon as elinor appear

well my dear she cri i sent you up to the
young man did not i do right?--and i suppos you had
no great difficulty--y did not find him veri unwil
to accept your proposal?

no maam; that wa not veri like

well and how soon will he be ready?--for it seem
all to depend upon that

realli said elinor i know so littl of these kind
of form that i can hardli even conjectur as to the time
or the prepar necessary; but i suppos two or three
month will complet hi ordin

two or three months! cri mr jennings; lord! my dear
how calmli you talk of it; and can the colonel wait two
or three months! lord bless me!--i am sure it would put me
quit out of patience!--and though one would be veri glad
to do a kind by poor mr ferrar i do think it is
not worth while to wait two or three month for him
sure somebodi els might be found that would do as well;
somebodi that is in order alreadi

my dear maam said elinor what can you be think of?--
whi colonel brandon onli object is to be of use to mr ferrar

lord bless you my dear!--sur you do not mean to persuad
me that the colonel onli marri you for the sake of give
ten guinea to mr ferrars!

the decept could not continu after this;
and an explan immedi took place by which both
gain consider amus for the moment without ani
materi loss of happi to either for mr jen
onli exchang one form of delight for anoth and still
without forfeit her expect of the first

aye aye the parsonag is but a small one said she
after the first ebullit of surpris and satisfact
wa over and veri like may be out of repair; but to hear
a man apologis as i thought for a hous that to my
knowledg ha five sit room on the ground-floor and i
think the housekeep told me could make up fifteen beds!--
and to you too that had been use to live in barton cottage!--
it seem quit ridicul but my dear we must
touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonag
and make it comfort for them befor luci goe to it

but colonel brandon doe not seem to have ani idea
of the live be enough to allow them to marri

the colonel is a ninni my dear; becaus he ha two
thousand a-year himself he think that nobodi els can marri
on less take my word for it that if i am aliv i shall
be pay a visit at delaford parsonag befor michaelmas;
and i am sure i shant go if luci ant there

elinor wa quit of her opinion as to the probabl
of their not wait for ani thing more



chapter 41


edward have carri hi thank to colonel brandon
proceed with hi happi to lucy; and such wa the
excess of it by the time he reach bartlett build
that she wa abl to assur mr jen who call
on her again the next day with her congratul
that she had never seen him in such spirit befor
in her life

her own happi and her own spirit were at
least veri certain; and she join mr jen most
heartili in her expect of their be all comfort
togeth in delaford parsonag befor michaelma
so far wa she at the same time from ani backward
to give elinor that credit which edward would give her
that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most
grate warmth wa readi to own all their oblig
to her and openli declar that no exert for their
good on miss dashwood part either present or futur
would ever surpris her for she believ her capabl of
do ani thing in the world for those she realli valu
as for colonel brandon she wa not onli readi to worship
him as a saint but wa moreov truli anxiou that
he should be treat as one in all worldli concerns;
anxiou that hi tith should be rais to the utmost;
and scarc resolv to avail herself at delaford
as far as she possibl could of hi servant hi carriag
hi cow and hi poultri

it wa now abov a week sinc john dashwood had
call in berkeley street and as sinc that time no notic
had been taken by them of hi wife indisposit
beyond one verbal enquiri elinor began to feel it
necessari to pay her a visit--thi wa an oblig
howev which not onli oppos her own inclin
but which had not the assist of ani encourag
from her companion mariann not content with
absolut refus to go herself wa veri urgent
to prevent her sister go at all; and mr jen
though her carriag wa alway at elinor servic
so veri much dislik mr john dashwood that not even her
curios to see how she look after the late discoveri
nor her strong desir to affront her by take edward part
could overcom her unwilling to be in her compani again
the consequ wa that elinor set out by herself
to pay a visit for which no one could realli have
less inclin and to run the risk of a tete-a-tet
with a woman whom neither of the other had so much
reason to dislik

mr dashwood wa denied; but befor the carriag could
turn from the hous her husband accident came out
he express great pleasur in meet elinor told her
that he had been just go to call in berkeley street
and assur her that fanni would be veri glad to see her
invit her to come in

they walk up stair in to the drawing-room--nobodi wa there

fanni is in her own room i suppos said he:--i
will go to her present for i am sure she will not
have the least object in the world to see you--
veri far from it inde now especi there
cannot be--but howev you and mariann were alway
great favourites--whi would not mariann come?--

elinor made what excus she could for her

i am not sorri to see you alon he repli
for i have a good deal to say to you thi live
of colonel brandons--can it be true?--ha he realli given
it to edward?--i heard it yesterday by chanc and wa
come to you on purpos to enquir farther about it

it is perfectli true--colonel brandon ha given
the live of delaford to edward

really!--wel thi is veri astonishing!--no
relationship!--no connect between them!--and now
that live fetch such a price!--what wa the valu of this?

about two hundr a year

veri well--and for the next present to a live
of that value--suppos the late incumb to have
been old and sickli and like to vacat it soon--h
might have got i dare say--fourteen hundr pound
and how came he not to have settl that matter befor thi
person death?--now inde it would be too late to sell it
but a man of colonel brandon sense!--i wonder he should
be so improvid in a point of such common such natur
concern!--wel i am convinc that there is a vast deal
of inconsist in almost everi human charact i suppos
however--on recollection--that the case may probabl be thi
edward is onli to hold the live till the person to whom
the colonel ha realli sold the present is old enough
to take it--ay aye that is the fact depend upon it

elinor contradict it howev veri positively;
and by relat that she had herself been employ
in convey the offer from colonel brandon to edward
and therefor must understand the term on which it
wa given oblig him to submit to her author

it is truli astonishing!--h cri after hear
what she said--what could be the colonel motive?

a veri simpl one--to be of use to mr ferrar

well well; whatev colonel brandon may be
edward is a veri lucki man--you will not mention the matter
to fanni howev for though i have broke it to her
and she bear it vastli well--sh will not like to hear
it much talk of

elinor had some difficulti here to refrain from observ
that she thought fanni might have born with composur
an acquisit of wealth to her brother by which neither
she nor her child could be possibl impoverish

mr ferrar ad he lower hi voic to the
tone becom so import a subject know noth
about it at present and i believ it will be best to
keep it entir conceal from her as long as may be--
when the marriag take place i fear she must hear
of it all

but whi should such precaut be used?--though
it is not to be suppos that mr ferrar can have
the smallest satisfact in know that her son ha
money enough to live upon--for that must be quit
out of the question; yet whi upon her late behaviour
is she suppos to feel at all?--sh ha done with her
son she cast him off for ever and ha made all those
over whom she had ani influenc cast him off likewis
sure after do so she cannot be imagin liabl
to ani impress of sorrow or of joy on hi account--
she cannot be interest in ani thing that befal him--
she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort
of a child and yet retain the anxieti of a parent!

ah! elinor said john your reason is veri good
but it is found on ignor of human natur
when edward unhappi match take place depend upon it
hi mother will feel as much as if she had never discard him;
and therefor everi circumst that may acceler that
dread event must be conceal from her as much as possibl
mr ferrar can never forget that edward is her son

you surpris me; i should think it must nearli
have escap her memori by thi time

you wrong her exceedingli mr ferrar is one
of the most affection mother in the world

elinor wa silent

we think now--said mr dashwood after a short paus
of robert marri miss morton

elinor smile at the grave and decis import
of her brother tone calmli repli

the ladi i suppos ha no choic in the affair

choice!--how do you mean?

i onli mean that i suppos from your manner
of speak it must be the same to miss morton whether
she marri edward or robert

certainli there can be no difference; for robert
will now to all intent and purpos be consid
as the eldest son;--and as to ani thing els they are
both veri agreeabl young men: i do not know that one
is superior to the other

elinor said no more and john wa also for a short
time silent--hi reflect end thu

of one thing my dear sister kindli take her hand
and speak in an aw whisper--i may assur you;--
and i will do it becaus i know it must gratifi you
i have good reason to think--inde i have it from the
best author or i should not repeat it for otherwis
it would be veri wrong to say ani thing about it--but
i have it from the veri best authority--not that i ever
precis heard mr ferrar say it herself--but her
daughter did and i have it from her--that in short
whatev object there might be against a certain--a
certain connection--y understand me--it would have been
far prefer to her it would not have given her half
the vexat that thi doe i wa exceedingli pleas
to hear that mr ferrar consid it in that light--
a veri gratifi circumst you know to us all
it would have been beyond comparison she said the least
evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now
for noth wors but howev all that is quit out
of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--
as to ani attach you know--it never could be--al
that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you
of thi becaus i knew how much it must pleas you
not that you have ani reason to regret my dear elinor there
is no doubt of your do exceedingli well--quit as well
or better perhap all thing consid ha colonel
brandon been with you lately?

elinor had heard enough if not to gratifi her vaniti
and rais her self-import to agit her nerv
and fill her mind;--and she wa therefor glad to be
spare from the necess of say much in repli herself
and from the danger of hear ani thing more from
her brother by the entranc of mr robert ferrar
after a few moment chat john dashwood recollect that
fanni wa yet uninform of her sister be there
quit the room in quest of her; and elinor wa left
to improv her acquaint with robert who by the
gay unconcern the happi self-complac of hi manner
while enjoy so unfair a divis of hi mother love
and liber to the prejudic of hi banish brother
earn onli by hi own dissip cours of life and that
brother integr wa confirm her most unfavour
opinion of hi head and heart

they had scarc been two minut by themselv
befor he began to speak of edward; for he too had heard
of the live and wa veri inquisit on the subject
elinor repeat the particular of it as she had given them
to john; and their effect on robert though veri differ
wa not less strike than it had been on him he laugh
most immoder the idea of edward be a clergyman
and live in a small parsonage-hous divert him
beyond measure;--and when to that wa ad the fanci
imageri of edward read prayer in a white surplic
and publish the bann of marriag between john smith and
mari brown he could conceiv noth more ridicul

elinor while she wait in silenc and immov
graviti the conclus of such folli could not restrain
her eye from be fix on him with a look that spoke
all the contempt it excit it wa a look howev
veri well bestow for it reliev her own feel and gave
no intellig to him he wa recal from wit to wisdom
not by ani reproof of her but by hi own sensibl

we may treat it as a joke said he at last
recov from the affect laugh which had consider
lengthen out the genuin gaieti of the moment--but upon
my soul it is a most seriou busi poor edward!
he is ruin for ever i am extrem sorri for it--
for i know him to be a veri good-heart creature; as
well-mean a fellow perhap as ani in the world
you must not judg of him miss dashwood from your
slight acquaintance--poor edward!--hi manner are certainli
not the happiest in nature--but we are not all born
you know with the same powers--th same address--
poor fellow!--to see him in a circl of strangers!--
to be sure it wa pitiabl enough!--but upon my soul
i believ he ha as good a heart as ani in the kingdom;
and i declar and protest to you i never wa so shock in my
life as when it all burst forth i could not believ it--
my mother wa the first person who told me of it;
and i feel myself call on to act with resolut
immedi said to her my dear madam i do not know
what you may intend to do on the occas but as for myself
i must say that if edward doe marri thi young woman
i never will see him again that wa what i said immediately--
i wa most uncommonli shock indeed!--poor edward!--h ha
done for himself completely--shut himself out for ever from
all decent society!--but as i directli said to my mother
i am not in the least surpris at it; from hi style
of educ it wa alway to be expect my poor mother
wa half frantic

have you ever seen the lady?

yes; onc while she wa stay in thi hous
i happen to drop in for ten minutes; and i saw
quit enough of her the merest awkward countri girl
without style or eleg and almost without beauty--
i rememb her perfectli just the kind of girl i
should suppos like to captiv poor edward
i offer immedi as soon as my mother relat
the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuad
him from the match; but it wa too late then i found
to do ani thing for unluckili i wa not in the way
at first and knew noth of it till after the breach
had taken place when it wa not for me you know
to interfer but had i been inform of it a few
hour earlier--i think it is most probable--that someth
might have been hit on i certainli should have repres
it to edward in a veri strong light my dear fellow
i should have said consid what you are do
you are make a most disgrac connect and such a one
as your famili are unanim in disapprov i cannot
help think in short that mean might have been found
but now it is all too late he must be starv you know;--
that is certain; absolut starv

he had just settl thi point with great composur
when the entranc of mr john dashwood put an end to the
subject
but though she never spoke of it out of her own famili
elinor could see it influenc on her mind in the someth
like confus of counten with which she enter
and an attempt at cordial in her behaviour to herself
she even proceed so far as to be concern to find
that elinor and her sister were so soon to leav town
as she had hope to see more of them;--an exert
in which her husband who attend her into the room
and hung enamour over her accent seem to distinguish
everi thing that wa most affection and grace



chapter 42


one other short call in harley street in which elinor
receiv her brother congratul on their travel
so far toward barton without ani expens and on colonel
brandon be to follow them to cleveland in a day or two
complet the intercours of the brother and sister
in town;--and a faint invit from fanni to come
to norland whenev it should happen to be in their way
which of all thing wa the most unlik to occur
with a more warm though less public assur from john
to elinor of the promptitud with which he should come
to see her at delaford wa all that foretold ani meet
in the countri

it amus her to observ that all her friend seem
determin to send her to delaford;--a place in which
of all other she would now least chuse to visit
or wish to reside; for not onli wa it consid as
her futur home by her brother and mr jen but even luci
when they part gave her a press invit to visit her there

veri earli in april and toler earli in the day
the two parti from hanov squar and berkeley street set
out from their respect home to meet by appoint
on the road for the conveni of charlott and her child
they were to be more than two day on their journey
and mr palmer travel more expediti with colonel brandon
wa to join them at cleveland soon after their arriv

mariann few as had been her hour of comfort
in london and eager as she had long been to quit it
could not when it came to the point bid adieu to
the hous in which she had for the last time enjoy
those hope and that confid in willoughbi
which were now extinguish for ever without great pain
nor could she leav the place in which willoughbi remain
busi in new engag and new scheme in which she
could have no share without shed mani tear

elinor satisfact at the moment of remov
wa more posit she had no such object for her linger
thought to fix on she left no creatur behind from whom
it would give her a moment regret to be divid for ever
she wa pleas to be free herself from the persecut
of luci friendship she wa grate for bring
her sister away unseen by willoughbi sinc hi marriag
and she look forward with hope to what a few month
of tranquil at barton might do toward restor
mariann peac of mind and confirm her own

their journey wa safe perform the second
day brought them into the cherish or the prohibit
counti of somerset for as such wa it dwelt on by turn
in mariann imagination; and in the forenoon of the third
they drove up to cleveland

cleveland wa a spaciou modern-built hous
situat on a slope lawn it had no park but the
pleasure-ground were toler extensive; and like
everi other place of the same degre of import
it had it open shrubberi and closer wood walk
a road of smooth gravel wind round a plantat
led to the front the lawn wa dot over with timber
the hous itself wa under the guardianship of the fir
the mountain-ash and the acacia and a thick screen of
them altogeth interspers with tall lombardi poplar
shut out the offic

mariann enter the hous with a heart swell
with emot from the conscious of be onli eighti
mile from barton and not thirti from comb magna;
and befor she had been five minut within it wall
while the other were busili help charlott to show
her child to the housekeep she quit it again
steal away through the wind shrubberi now just
begin to be in beauti to gain a distant eminence;
where from it grecian templ her eye wander over
a wide tract of countri to the south-east could fondli
rest on the farthest ridg of hill in the horizon
and fanci that from their summit comb magna might be seen

in such moment of preciou invalu miseri
she rejoic in tear of agoni to be at cleveland;
and as she return by a differ circuit to the hous
feel all the happi privileg of countri liberti
of wander from place to place in free and luxuri solitud
she resolv to spend almost everi hour of everi day
while she remain with the palmer in the indulg of
such solitari rambl

she return just in time to join the other
as they quit the hous on an excurs through it
more immedi premises; and the rest of the morn wa
easili while away in loung round the kitchen garden
examin the bloom upon it wall and listen to the
garden lament upon blight in dawdl through
the green-hous where the loss of her favourit plant
unwarili expos and nip by the linger frost
rais the laughter of charlotte--and in visit her
poultry-yard where in the disappoint hope of her
dairy-maid by hen forsak their nest or be
stolen by a fox or in the rapid decreas of a promis
young brood she found fresh sourc of merriment

the morn wa fine and dri and mariann
in her plan of employ abroad had not calcul
for ani chang of weather dure their stay at cleveland
with great surpris therefor did she find herself prevent
by a settl rain from go out again after dinner
she had depend on a twilight walk to the grecian templ
and perhap all over the ground and an even mere
cold or damp would not have deter her from it;
but a heavi and settl rain even she could not fanci dri
or pleasant weather for walk

their parti wa small and the hour pass quietli away
mr palmer had her child and mr jen her carpet-work;
they talk of the friend they had left behind
arrang ladi middleton engag and wonder
whether mr palmer and colonel brandon would get farther
than read that night elinor howev littl concern
in it join in their discourse; and mariann who had
the knack of find her way in everi hous to the librari
howev it might be avoid by the famili in gener
soon procur herself a book

noth wa want on mr palmer side that constant
and friendli good humour could do to make them feel
themselv welcom the open and hearti of her
manner more than aton for that want of recollect
and eleg which made her often defici in the form
of politeness; her kind recommend by so pretti
a face wa engaging; her folli though evid
wa not disgust becaus it wa not conceited;
and elinor could have forgiven everi thing but her laugh

the two gentlemen arriv the next day to a veri
late dinner afford a pleasant enlarg of the parti
and a veri welcom varieti to their convers which a
long morn of the same continu rain had reduc veri low

elinor had seen so littl of mr palmer and in that
littl had seen so much varieti in hi address to her
sister and herself that she knew not what to expect
to find him in hi own famili she found him howev
perfectli the gentleman in hi behaviour to all hi visitor
and onli occasion rude to hi wife and her mother;
she found him veri capabl of be a pleasant companion
and onli prevent from be so alway by too great
an aptitud to fanci himself as much superior to peopl
in gener as he must feel himself to be to mr jen
and charlott for the rest of hi charact and habit
they were mark as far as elinor could perceiv
with no trait at all unusu in hi sex and time of life
he wa nice in hi eat uncertain in hi hours;
fond of hi child though affect to slight it;
and idl away the morn at billiard which ought
to have been devot to busi she like him howev
upon the whole much better than she had expect and in
her heart wa not sorri that she could like him no more;--
not sorri to be driven by the observ of hi epicur
hi selfish and hi conceit to rest with complac
on the remembr of edward gener temper simpl tast
and diffid feel

of edward or at least of some of hi concern
she now receiv intellig from colonel brandon
who had been into dorsetshir lately; and who
treat her at onc as the disinterest friend
of mr ferrar and the kind of confid of himself
talk to her a great deal of the parsonag at delaford
describ it defici and told her what he meant
to do himself toward remov them--hi behaviour
to her in thi as well as in everi other particular
hi open pleasur in meet her after an absenc
of onli ten day hi readi to convers with her
and hi defer for her opinion might veri well
justifi mr jenningss persuas of hi attach
and would have been enough perhap had not elinor still
as from the first believ mariann hi real favourit
to make her suspect it herself but as it wa
such a notion had scarc ever enter her head
except by mr jenningss suggestion; and she could
not help believ herself the nicest observ of the
two;--sh watch hi eye while mr jen thought
onli of hi behaviour;--and while hi look of anxiou
solicitud on mariann feel in her head and throat
the begin of a heavi cold becaus unexpress by word
entir escap the latter ladi observation;--sh could
discov in them the quick feel and needless alarm
of a lover

two deligh twilight walk on the third and fourth
even of her be there not mere on the dri gravel
of the shrubberi but all over the ground and especi
in the most distant part of them where there wa someth
more of wild than in the rest where the tree were
the oldest and the grass wa the longest and wettest
had--assist by the still greater imprud of sit
in her wet shoe and stockings--given mariann a cold
so violent as though for a day or two trifl with
or deni would forc itself by increas ailment on
the concern of everi bodi and the notic of herself
prescript pour in from all quarter and as usual
were all declin though heavi and feverish with a pain
in her limb and a cough and a sore throat a good night
rest wa to cure her entirely; and it wa with difficulti
that elinor prevail on her when she went to bed
to tri one or two of the simplest of the remedi



chapter 43


mariann got up the next morn at her usual time;
to everi inquiri repli that she wa better and tri to
prove herself so by engag in her accustomari employ
but a day spent in sit shiver over the fire
with a book in her hand which she wa unabl to read
or in lie weari and languid on a sofa did not speak
much in favour of her amendment; and when at last
she went earli to bed more and more indispos colonel
brandon wa onli astonish at her sister composur
who though attend and nurs her the whole day
against mariann inclin and forc proper medicin
on her at night trust like mariann to the certainti
and efficaci of sleep and felt no real alarm

a veri restless and feverish night howev
disappoint the expect of both; and when mariann
after persist in rise confess herself unabl
to sit up and return voluntarili to her bed
elinor wa veri readi to adopt mr jenningss advic
of send for the palmer apothecari

he came examin hi patient and though encourag
miss dashwood to expect that a veri few day would restor
her sister to health yet by pronounc her disord
to have a putrid tendenc and allow the word infect
to pass hi lip gave instant alarm to mr palmer
on her babi account mr jen who had been inclin
from the first to think mariann complaint more seriou
than elinor now look veri grave on mr harriss report
and confirm charlott fear and caution urg the
necess of her immedi remov with her infant;
and mr palmer though treat their apprehens as idl
found the anxieti and importun of hi wife too great
to be withstood her departur therefor wa fix on;
and within an hour after mr harriss arriv she set off
with her littl boy and hi nurs for the hous of a
near relat of mr palmer who live a few mile
on the other side of bath; whither her husband promis
at her earnest entreati to join her in a day or two;
and whither she wa almost equal urgent with her
mother to accompani her mr jen howev with a
kind of heart which made elinor realli love her
declar her resolut of not stir from cleveland
as long as mariann remain ill and of endeavour
by her own attent care to suppli to her the place
of the mother she had taken her from; and elinor found her
on everi occas a most will and activ helpmat
desir to share in all her fatigu and often by her
better experi in nurs of materi use

poor mariann languid and low from the natur
of her maladi and feel herself univers ill
could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered;
and the idea of what tomorrow would have produc
but for thi unlucki ill made everi ailment severe;
for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;
and attend the whole way by a servant of mr jen
were to have taken their mother by surpris on the
follow forenoon the littl she said wa all in
lament of thi inevit delay; though elinor tri
to rais her spirit and make her believ as she then
realli believ herself that it would be a veri short one

the next day produc littl or no alter in the
state of the patient; she certainli wa not better and
except that there wa no amend did not appear wors
their parti wa now farther reduced; for mr palmer
though veri unwil to go as well from real human
and good-natur as from a dislik of appear to be
frighten away by hi wife wa persuad at last
by colonel brandon to perform hi promis of follow her;
and while he wa prepar to go colonel brandon himself
with a much greater exert began to talk of go
likewise--her howev the kind of mr jen
interpos most acceptably; for to send the colonel away
while hi love wa in so much uneasi on her sister
account would be to depriv them both she thought
of everi comfort; and therefor tell him at onc
that hi stay at cleveland wa necessari to herself
that she should want him to play at piquet of an even
while miss dashwood wa abov with her sister &c she
urg him so strongli to remain that he who wa gratifi
the first wish of hi own heart by a complianc could not
long even affect to demur; especi as mr jenningss
entreati wa warmli second by mr palmer who seem
to feel a relief to himself in leav behind him a person
so well abl to assist or advis miss dashwood in ani emerg

mariann wa of cours kept in ignor of all
these arrang she knew not that she had been
the mean of send the owner of cleveland away
in about seven day from the time of their arriv
it gave her no surpris that she saw noth
of mr palmer; and as it gave her likewis no concern
she never mention her name

two day pass away from the time of mr palmer departur
and her situat continu with littl variat
the same mr harri who attend her everi day
still talk boldli of a speedi recoveri and miss dashwood
wa equal sanguine; but the expect of the other
wa by no mean so cheer mr jen had determin
veri earli in the seizur that mariann would never
get over it and colonel brandon who wa chiefli
of use in listen to mr jenningss forebod
wa not in a state of mind to resist their influenc
he tri to reason himself out of fear which the differ
judgment of the apothecari seem to render absurd;
but the mani hour of each day in which he wa left
entir alon were but too favour for the admiss
of everi melancholi idea and he could not expel from
hi mind the persuas that he should see mariann no more

on the morn of the third day howev the gloomi
anticip of both were almost done away; for when
mr harri arriv he declar hi patient materi better
her puls wa much stronger and everi symptom more favour
than on the preced visit elinor confirm in everi
pleasant hope wa all cheerfulness; rejoic that
in her letter to her mother she had pursu her own
judgment rather than her friend in make veri light
of the indisposit which delay them at cleveland;
and almost fix on the time when mariann would be
abl to travel

but the day did not close so auspici as it began--
toward the even mariann becam ill again grow
more heavi restless and uncomfort than befor
her sister howev still sanguin wa will to
attribut the chang to noth more than the fatigu
of have sat up to have her bed made; and care
administ the cordial prescrib saw her with
satisfact sink at last into a slumber from which
she expect the most benefici effect her sleep
though not so quiet as elinor wish to see it
last a consider time; and anxiou to observ
the result of it herself she resolv to sit with her
dure the whole of it mr jen know noth
of ani chang in the patient went unusu earli to bed;
her maid who wa one of the princip nurs wa recreat
herself in the housekeep room and elinor remain
alon with mariann

the repos of the latter becam more and more disturbed;
and her sister who watch with unremit attent
her continu chang of postur and heard the frequent
but inarticul sound of complaint which pass her lip
wa almost wish to rous her from so pain a slumber
when mariann suddenli awaken by some accident nois
in the hous start hastili up and with feverish wild
cri out--

is mama coming?--

not yet cri the other conceal her terror
and assist mariann to lie down again but she will
be here i hope befor it is long it is a great way
you know from henc to barton

but she must not go round by london cri mariann
in the same hurri manner i shall never see her
if she goe by london

elinor perceiv with alarm that she wa not
quit herself and while attempt to sooth her
eagerli felt her puls it wa lower and quicker than ever!
and mariann still talk wildli of mama her alarm
increas so rapidli as to determin her on send
instantli for mr harri and despatch a messeng
to barton for her mother to consult with colonel brandon
on the best mean of effect the latter wa a thought
which immedi follow the resolut of it performance;
and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place
by her sister she hasten down to the drawing-room
where she knew he wa gener to be found at a much
later hour than the present

it wa no time for hesit her fear and her
difficulti were immedi befor him her fear
he had no courag no confid to attempt the remov of:--
he listen to them in silent despondence;--but her
difficulti were instantli obviat for with a readi
that seem to speak the occas and the servic
pre-arrang in hi mind he offer himself as the
messeng who should fetch mr dashwood elinor made no
resist that wa not easili overcom she thank him
with brief though fervent gratitud and while he went
to hurri off hi servant with a messag to mr harri and
an order for post-hors directli she wrote a few line
to her mother

the comfort of such a friend at that moment as colonel
brandon--or such a companion for her mother--how grate
wa it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guid
whose attend must reliev and whose friendship might
sooth her!--a far as the shock of such a summon could
be lessen to her hi presenc hi manner hi assist
would lessen it

he meanwhil whatev he might feel act with all
the firm of a collect mind made everi necessari
arrang with the utmost despatch and calcul
with exact the time in which she might look for
hi return not a moment wa lost in delay of ani kind
the hors arriv even befor they were expect
and colonel brandon onli press her hand with a look
of solemn and a few word spoken too low to reach her ear
hurri into the carriag it wa then about twelv
oclock and she return to her sister apart to wait
for the arriv of the apothecari and to watch by her
the rest of the night it wa a night of almost equal
suffer to both hour after hour pass away in sleepless
pain and delirium on mariann side and in the most
cruel anxieti on elinor befor mr harri appear
her apprehens onc rais paid by their excess for all
her former security; and the servant who sat up with her
for she would not allow mr jen to be call
onli tortur her more by hint of what her mistress
had alway thought

mariann idea were still at interv
fix incoher on her mother and whenev she
mention her name it gave a pang to the heart of
poor elinor who reproach herself for have trifl
with so mani day of ill and wretch for some
immedi relief fanci that all relief might soon
be in vain that everi thing had been delay too long
and pictur to herself her suffer mother arriv
too late to see thi darl child or to see her ration

she wa on the point of send again for mr harri
or if he could not come for some other advic
when the former--but not till after five oclock--arriv
hi opinion howev made some littl amend for hi delay
for though acknowledg a veri unexpect and unpleas
alter in hi patient he would not allow the danger
to be materi and talk of the relief which a fresh
mode of treatment must procur with a confid which
in a lesser degre wa commun to elinor he promis
to call again in the cours of three or four hour
and left both the patient and her anxiou attend more
compos than he had found them

with strong concern and with mani reproach for not
be call to their aid did mr jen hear in the
morn of what had pass her former apprehens
now with greater reason restor left her no doubt of
the event; and though tri to speak comfort to elinor
her convict of her sister danger would not allow her
to offer the comfort of hope her heart wa realli griev
the rapid decay the earli death of a girl so young
so love as mariann must have struck a less interest
person with concern on mr jenningss compass
she had other claim she had been for three month
her companion wa still under her care and she wa
known to have been greatli injur and long unhappi
the distress of her sister too particularli a favourit
wa befor her;--and as for their mother when mr jen
consid that mariann might probabl be to her what
charlott wa to herself her sympathi in her suffer
wa veri sincer

mr harri wa punctual in hi second visit;--
but he came to be disappoint in hi hope of what the
last would produc hi medicin had failed;--th fever
wa unabated; and mariann onli more quiet--not more
herself--remain in a heavi stupor elinor catch all
and more than all hi fear in a moment propos to call
in further advic but he judg it unnecessary: he had
still someth more to tri some more fresh applic
of whose success he wa as confid as the last and hi
visit conclud with encourag assur which reach
the ear but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood
she wa calm except when she thought of her mother;
but she wa almost hopeless; and in thi state she continu
till noon scarc stir from her sister bed
her thought wander from one imag of grief
one suffer friend to anoth and her spirit oppress
to the utmost by the convers of mr jen
who scrupl not to attribut the sever and danger
of thi attack to the mani week of previou indisposit
which mariann disappoint had brought on
elinor felt all the reason of the idea and it
gave fresh miseri to her reflect

about noon howev she began--but with a caution--a
dread of disappoint which for some time kept her silent
even to her friend--to fanci to hope she could perceiv
a slight amend in her sister pulse;--sh wait
watch and examin it again and again;--and at last
with an agit more difficult to buri under exterior calm
than all her forego distress ventur to commun
her hope mr jen though forc on examin
to acknowledg a temporari reviv tri to keep her
young friend from indulg a thought of it continuance;--
and elinor con over everi injunct of distrust
told herself likewis not to hope but it wa too late
hope had alreadi entered; and feel all it anxiou flutter
she bent over her sister to watch--sh hardli knew for what
half an hour pass away and the favour symptom
yet bless her other even aros to confirm it
her breath her skin her lip all flatter elinor
with sign of amendment; and mariann fix her eye on
her with a ration though languid gaze anxieti and
hope now oppress her in equal degre and left her no
moment of tranquil till the arriv of mr harri at
four oclock;--when hi assur hi felicit on
a recoveri in her sister even surpass hi expect
gave her confid comfort and tear of joy

mariann wa in everi respect materi better
and he declar her entir out of danger mr jen
perhap satisfi with the partial justif of her
forebod which had been found in their late alarm
allow herself to trust in hi judgment and admit
with unfeign joy and soon with unequivoc cheer
the probabl of an entir recoveri

elinor could not be cheer her joy wa of a
differ kind and led to ani thing rather than to gaieti
mariann restor to life health friend and to her
dote mother wa an idea to fill her heart with sensat
of exquisit comfort and expand it in fervent gratitude;--
but it lead to no outward demonstr of joy no word
no smile all within elinor breast wa satisfact
silent and strong

she continu by the side of her sister with littl
intermiss the whole afternoon calm everi fear
satisfi everi inquiri of her enfeebl spirit
suppli everi succour and watch almost everi look and
everi breath the possibl of a relaps would of cours
in some moment occur to remind her of what anxieti was--
but when she saw on her frequent and minut examin
that everi symptom of recoveri continu and saw mariann
at six oclock sink into a quiet steadi and to all
appear comfort sleep she silenc everi doubt

the time wa now draw on when colonel brandon
might be expect back at ten oclock she trust
or at least not much later her mother would be reliev
from the dread suspens in which she must now be
travel toward them the colonel too!--perhap scarc
less an object of pity!--oh!--how slow wa the progress
of time which yet kept them in ignorance!

at seven oclock leav mariann still sweetli asleep
she join mr jen in the drawing-room to tea
of breakfast she had been kept by her fear and of
dinner by their sudden revers from eat much;--
and the present refresh therefor with such feel
of content as she brought to it wa particularli welcom
mr jen would have persuad her at it conclus
to take some rest befor her mother arriv and allow her to
take her place by marianne; but elinor had no sens of fatigu
no capabl of sleep at that moment about her and she wa
not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessari instant
mr jen therefor attend her up stair into the
sick chamber to satisfi herself that all continu right
left her there again to her charg and her thought
and retir to her own room to write letter and sleep

the night wa cold and stormi the wind roar
round the hous and the rain beat against the windows;
but elinor all happi within regard it not
mariann slept through everi blast; and the travellers--
they had a rich reward in store for everi present inconveni

the clock struck eight had it been ten
elinor would have been convinc that at that moment
she heard a carriag drive up to the house;
and so strong wa the persuas that she did in spite
of the almost imposs of their be alreadi come
that she move into the adjoin dressing-closet and
open a window shutter to be satisfi of the truth
she instantli saw that her ear had not deceiv her
the flare lamp of a carriag were immedi in view
by their uncertain light she thought she could discern it
to be drawn by four horses; and thi while it told the
excess of her poor mother alarm gave some explan
to such unexpect rapid

never in her life had elinor found it so difficult
to be calm as at that moment the knowledg of what her
mother must be feel as the carriag stopt at the door--
of her doubt--her dread--perhap her despair!--and
of what she had to tell!--with such knowledg it wa
imposs to be calm all that remain to be done
wa to be speedy; and therefor stay onli till
she could leav mr jenningss maid with her sister
she hurri down stair

the bustl in the vestibul as she pass along
an inner lobbi assur her that they were alreadi
in the hous she rush to the drawing-room--sh
enter it--and saw onli willoughbi



chapter 44


elinor start back with a look of horror at
the sight of him obey the first impuls of her heart
in turn instantli to quit the room and her hand
wa alreadi on the lock when it action wa suspend
by hi hastili advanc and say in a voic rather
of command than supplic

miss dashwood for half an hour--for ten minutes--
i entreat you to stay

no sir she repli with firm i shall not stay
your busi cannot be with me the servant i suppos
forgot to tell you that mr palmer wa not in the hous

had they told me he cri with vehem
that mr palmer and all hi relat were at the devil
it would not have turn me from the door my busi
is with you and onli you

with me!--in the utmost amazement--wel sir--
be quick--and if you can--less violent

sit down and i will be both

she hesitated; she knew not what to do the possibl
of colonel brandon arriv and find her there
came across her but she had promis to hear him
and her curios no less than her honor wa engag
after a moment recollect therefor conclud that
prudenc requir dispatch and that her acquiesc would
best promot it she walk silent toward the tabl
and sat down he took the opposit chair and for half
a minut not a word wa said by either

pray be quick sir--said elinor impatiently;--
i have no time to spare

he wa sit in an attitud of deep medit
and seem not to hear her

your sister said he with abrupt a moment
afterwards--i out of danger i heard it from the servant
god be praised!--but is it true? is it realli true?

elinor would not speak he repeat the inquiri with
yet greater eager

for god sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not?

we hope she is

he rose up and walk across the room

had i known as much half an hour ago--but
sinc i am here--speak with a forc vivac as he
return to hi seat--what doe it signify?--for onc
miss dashwood--it will be the last time perhaps--let us
be cheer together--i am in a fine mood for gaiety--
tell me honestly--a deeper glow overspread hi cheeks--
do you think me most a knave or a fool?

elinor look at him with greater astonish than ever
she began to think that be must be in liquor;--th
strang of such a visit and of such manner
seem no otherwis intelligible; and with thi impress
she immedi rose say

mr willoughbi i advis you at present to return
to combe--i am not at leisur to remain with you longer--
whatev your busi may be with me will it be better
recollect and explain to-morrow

i understand you he repli with an express smile
and a voic perfectli calm; ye i am veri drunk--
a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough wa
enough to over-set me

at marlborough!--cri elinor more and more at
a loss to understand what he would be at

yes--i left london thi morn at eight oclock
and the onli ten minut i have spent out of my chais
sinc that time procur me a nuncheon at marlborough

the steadi of hi manner and the intellig
of hi eye as he spoke convinc elinor that whatev
other unpardon folli might bring him to cleveland
he wa not brought there by intox she said
after a moment recollect

mr willoughbi you ought to feel and i certainli
do--that after what ha passed--your come here in
thi manner and forc yourself upon my notic
requir a veri particular excuse--what is it
that you mean by it?--

i mean--said he with seriou energy--if i can
to make you hate me one degre less than you do now
i mean to offer some kind of explan some kind
of apolog for the past; to open my whole heart to you
and by convinc you that though i have been alway
a blockhead i have not been alway a rascal to obtain
someth like forgiv from ma--from your sister

is thi the real reason of your coming?

upon my soul it is--wa hi answer with a warmth
which brought all the former willoughbi to her remembr
and in spite of herself made her think him sincer

if that is all you may be satisfi already--
for mariann does--sh ha long forgiven you

ha she?--h cri in the same eager tone--
then she ha forgiven me befor she ought to have done it
but she shall forgiv me again and on more reason
grounds--now will you listen to me?

elinor bow her assent

i do not know said he after a paus of expect
on her side and thought on hi own--how you
may have account for my behaviour to your sister
or what diabol motiv you may have imput to me--
perhap you will hardli think the better of me--it is
worth the trial howev and you shall hear everi thing
when i first becam intim in your famili i had no
other intent no other view in the acquaint
than to pass my time pleasantli while i wa oblig to remain
in devonshir more pleasantli than i had ever done befor
your sister love person and interest manner
could not but pleas me; and her behaviour to me almost
from the first wa of a kind--it is astonish
when i reflect on what it wa and what she wa that my
heart should have been so insensible! but at first
i must confess my vaniti onli wa elev by it
careless of her happi think onli of my own amus
give way to feel which i had alway been too much
in the habit of indulg i endeavour by everi mean
in my power to make myself pleas to her without ani
design of return her affect

miss dashwood at thi point turn her eye on him
with the most angri contempt stop him by say

it is hardli worth while mr willoughbi
for you to relat or for me to listen ani longer
such a begin as thi cannot be follow by ani thing--
do not let me be pain by hear ani thing more on
the subject

i insist on you hear the whole of it he repli
my fortun wa never larg and i had alway been expens
alway in the habit of associ with peopl of better
incom than myself everi year sinc my come of age
or even befor i believ had ad to my debts; and though
the death of my old cousin mr smith wa to set me free;
yet that event be uncertain and possibl far distant
it had been for some time my intent to re-establish my
circumst by marri a woman of fortun to attach
myself to your sister therefor wa not a thing to be
thought of;--and with a mean selfish cruelty--
which no indign no contemptu look even of your
miss dashwood can ever reprob too much--i wa act
in thi manner tri to engag her regard without a
thought of return it--but one thing may be said
for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vaniti
i did not know the extent of the injuri i medit
becaus i did not then know what it wa to love
but have i ever known it?--wel may it be doubted; for had i
realli love could i have sacrif my feel to vaniti
to avarice?--or what is more could i have sacrif hers?--
but i have done it to avoid a compar poverti
which her affect and her societi would have depriv
of all it horror i have by rais myself to affluenc
lost everi thing that could make it a bless

you did then said elinor a littl soften
believ yourself at one time attach to her?

to have resist such attract to have withstood
such tenderness!--i there a man on earth who could have
done it?--y i found myself by insens degre
sincer fond of her; and the happiest hour of my life
were what i spent with her when i felt my intent
were strictli honour and my feel blameless
even then howev when fulli determin on pay
my address to her i allow myself most improperli
to put off from day to day the moment of do it
from an unwilling to enter into an engag
while my circumst were so greatli embarrass
i will not reason here--nor will i stop for you to expati
on the absurd and the wors than absurd of scrupl
to engag my faith where my honour wa alreadi bound
the event ha prove that i wa a cun fool
provid with great circumspect for a possibl
opportun of make myself contempt and wretch
for ever at last howev my resolut wa taken
and i had determin as soon as i could engag her alon
to justifi the attent i had so invari paid her
and openli assur her of an affect which i had alreadi
taken such pain to display but in the interim--in the
interim of the veri few hour that were to pass befor i
could have an opportun of speak with her in private--
a circumst occurred--an unlucki circumst to ruin
all my resolut and with it all my comfort a discoveri
took place--her he hesit and look down--mr smith
had somehow or other been inform i imagin by some
distant relat whose interest it wa to depriv me of
her favour of an affair a connection--but i need not
explain myself farther he ad look at her with an
heighten colour and an enquir eye--your particular
intimacy--y have probabl heard the whole stori long ago

i have return elinor colour likewis
and harden her heart anew against ani compass for him
i have heard it all and how you will explain away ani
part of your guilt in that dread busi i confess
is beyond my comprehens

rememb cri willoughbi from whom you receiv
the account could it be an imparti one? i acknowledg
that her situat and her charact ought to have been
respect by me i do not mean to justifi myself but at
the same time cannot leav you to suppos that i have noth
to urge--that becaus she wa injur she wa irreproach
and becaus i wa a libertin she must be a saint
if the violenc of her passion the weak of her
understanding--i do not mean howev to defend myself
her affect for me deserv better treatment and i often
with great self-reproach recal the tender which
for a veri short time had the power of creat ani return
i wish--i heartili wish it had never been but i have injur
more than herself; and i have injur one whose affect
for me--(may i say it?) wa scarc less warm than hers;
and whose mind--oh! how infinit superior!--

your indiffer howev toward that unfortun
girl--i must say it unpleas to me as the discuss
of such a subject may well be--your indiffer is no
apolog for your cruel neglect of her do not think yourself
excus by ani weak ani natur defect of understand
on her side in the wanton cruelti so evid on your
you must have known that while you were enjoy yourself
in devonshir pursu fresh scheme alway gay
alway happi she wa reduc to the extremest indig

but upon my soul i did not know it he warmli
replied; i did not recollect that i had omit to give
her my direction; and common sens might have told her
how to find it out

well sir and what said mr smith?

she tax me with the offenc at onc and my confus
may be guess the puriti of her life the formal
of her notion her ignor of the world--everi thing
wa against me the matter itself i could not deni
and vain wa everi endeavour to soften it she wa
previous dispos i believ to doubt the moral of my
conduct in gener and wa moreov discont with
the veri littl attent the veri littl portion of my
time that i had bestow on her in my present visit
in short it end in a total breach by one measur i
might have save myself in the height of her moral
good woman! she offer to forgiv the past if i would
marri eliza that could not be--and i wa formal
dismiss from her favour and her hous the night
follow thi affair--i wa to go the next morning--
wa spent by me in deliber on what my futur conduct
should be the struggl wa great--but it end too soon
my affect for mariann my thorough convict of her
attach to me--it wa all insuffici to outweigh
that dread of poverti or get the better of those fals
idea of the necess of rich which i wa natur
inclin to feel and expens societi had increas
i had reason to believ myself secur of my present wife
if i chose to address her and i persuad myself to think
that noth els in common prudenc remain for me to do
a heavi scene howev await me befor i could leav
devonshire;--i wa engag to dine with you on that veri day;
some apolog wa therefor necessari for my break
thi engag but whether i should write thi apolog
or deliv it in person wa a point of long debat
to see mariann i felt would be dread and i even doubt
whether i could see her again and keep to my resolut
in that point howev i undervalu my own magnanim
as the event declared; for i went i saw her and saw
her miser and left her miserable--and left her hope
never to see her again

whi did you call mr willoughby? said elinor
reproachfully; a note would have answer everi purpose--
whi wa it necessari to call?

it wa necessari to my own pride i could not bear
to leav the countri in a manner that might lead you
or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect ani part
of what had realli pass between mr smith and myself--
and i resolv therefor on call at the cottag
in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister
howev wa realli dreadful; and to heighten the matter
i found her alon you were all gone i do not know where
i had left her onli the even befor so fulli
so firmli resolv within my self on do right!
a few hour were to have engag her to me for ever;
and i rememb how happi how gay were my spirit as i
walk from the cottag to allenham satisfi with myself
delight with everi body! but in thi our last interview
of friendship i approach her with a sens of guilt
that almost took from me the power of dissembl
her sorrow her disappoint her deep regret when i told
her that i wa oblig to leav devonshir so immediately--i
never shall forget it--unit too with such relianc
such confid in me!--oh god!--what a hard-heart
rascal i was!

they were both silent for a few moment
elinor first spoke

did you tell her that you should soon return?

i do not know what i told her he repli impatiently;
less than wa due to the past beyond a doubt and in all
likelihood much more than wa justifi by the futur
i cannot think of it--it wont do--then came your dear mother
to tortur me farther with all her kind and confid
thank heaven! it did tortur me i wa miser
miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
give me to look back on my own miseri i owe such a grudg
to myself for the stupid rascal folli of my own heart
that all my past suffer under it are onli triumph and
exult to me now well i went left all that i love
and went to those to whom at best i wa onli indiffer
my journey to town--travel with my own hors
and therefor so tediously--no creatur to speak to--mi
own reflect so cheerful--when i look forward
everi thing so inviting!--when i look back at barton
the pictur so soothing!--oh it wa a bless journey!

he stop

well sir said elinor who though piti him
grew impati for hi departur and thi is all?

ah!--no--hav you forgot what pass in town?--
that infam letter--did she shew it you?

ye i saw everi note that pass

when the first of her reach me (a it immedi did
for i wa in town the whole time) what i felt is--
in the common phrase not to be expressed; in a more
simpl one--perhap too simpl to rais ani emotion--
my feel were veri veri painful--everi line everi word
was--in the hackney metaphor which their dear writer
were she here would forbid--a dagger to my heart
to know that mariann wa in town was--in the same language--
a thunderbolt--thunderbolt and daggers!--what a reproof
would she have given me!--her tast her opinions--i believ
they are better known to me than my own--and i am sure
they are dearer

elinor heart which had undergon mani chang
in the cours of thi extraordinari convers
wa now soften again;--yet she felt it her duti to check
such idea in her companion as the last

thi is not right mr willoughby--rememb that
you are marri relat onli what in your conscienc
you think necessari for me to hear

mariann note by assur me that i wa still
as dear to her as in former day that in spite of the mani
mani week we had been separ she wa as constant
in her own feel and as full of faith in the constanc
of mine as ever awaken all my remors i say awaken
becaus time and london busi and dissip
had in some measur quiet it and i had been grow
a fine harden villain fanci myself indiffer to her
and chuse to fanci that she too must have becom
indiffer to me; talk to myself of our past attach
as a mere idl trifl busi shrug up my shoulder
in proof of it be so and silenc everi reproach
overcom everi scrupl by secretli say now and then
i shall be heartili glad to hear she is well married--
but thi note made me know myself better i felt that
she wa infinit dearer to me than ani other woman
in the world and that i wa use her infam
but everi thing wa then just settl between miss grey
and me to retreat wa imposs all that i had to do
wa to avoid you both i sent no answer to mariann
intend by that to preserv myself from her farther notice;
and for some time i wa even determin not to call in
berkeley street;--but at last judg it wiser to affect
the air of a cool common acquaint than anyth els
i watch you all safe out of the hous one morn
and left my name

watch us out of the house!

even so you would be surpris to hear how often
i watch you how often i wa on the point of fall
in with you i have enter mani a shop to avoid your sight
as the carriag drove by lodg as i did in bond street
there wa hardli a day in which i did not catch a glimps
of one or other of you; and noth but the most constant
watch on my side a most invari prevail
desir to keep out of your sight could have separ us
so long i avoid the middleton as much as possibl
as well as everybodi els who wa like to prove
an acquaint in common not awar of their be
in town howev i blunder on sir john i believ
the first day of hi come and the day after i had call
at mr jenningss he ask me to a parti a danc at hi
hous in the evening--had he not told me as an induc
that you and your sister were to be there i should have
felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him
the next morn brought anoth short note from marianne--
still affection open artless confiding--everyth
that could make my conduct most hate i could not
answer it i tried--but could not frame a sentenc
but i thought of her i believ everi moment of the day
if you can piti me miss dashwood piti my situat as it
wa then with my head and heart full of your sister
i wa forc to play the happi lover to anoth woman!--thos
three or four week were wors than all well at last
as i need not tell you you were forc on me; and what a
sweet figur i cut!--what an even of agoni it was!--
mariann beauti as an angel on one side call me
willoughbi in such a tone!--oh god!--hold out her hand
to me ask me for an explan with those bewitch
eye fix in such speak solicitud on my face!--and
sophia jealou as the devil on the other hand look
all that was--wel it doe not signify; it is over now--
such an evening!--i ran away from you all as soon as i could;
but not befor i had seen mariann sweet face as white
as death--that wa the last last look i ever had of her;--
the last manner in which she appear to me it wa a horrid
sight!--yet when i thought of her to-day as realli die
it wa a kind of comfort to me to imagin that i knew
exactli how she would appear to those who saw her last
in thi world she wa befor me constantli befor me
as i travel in the same look and hue

a short paus of mutual thought succeed
willoughbi first rous himself broke it thus:

well let me make hast and be gone your sister
is certainli better certainli out of danger?

we are assur of it

your poor mother too!--dot on mariann

but the letter mr willoughbi your own letter;
have you ani thing to say about that?

ye ye that in particular your sister
wrote to me again you know the veri next morn
you saw what she said i wa breakfast at the
ellisons--and her letter with some other wa brought
to me there from my lodg it happen to catch
sophia eye befor it caught mine--and it size
the eleg of the paper the hand-writ altogeth
immedi gave her a suspicion some vagu report had
reach her befor of my attach to some young ladi
in devonshir and what had pass within her observ
the preced even had mark who the young ladi wa
and made her more jealou than ever affect that air
of play therefor which is delight in a woman
one love she open the letter directli and read
it content she wa well paid for her impud
she read what made her wretch her wretched i could
have born but her passion--h malice--at all event it
must be appeas and in short--what do you think of my
wife style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--
truli feminine--wa it not?

your wife!--th letter wa in your own hand-writ

ye but i had onli the credit of servil copi
such sentenc as i wa asham to put my name to
the origin wa all her own--her own happi thought
and gentl diction but what could i do!--w were engag
everi thing in prepar the day almost fixed--but i am
talk like a fool preparation!--day!--in honest word
her money wa necessari to me and in a situat like
mine ani thing wa to be done to prevent a ruptur
and after all what did it signifi to my charact
in the opinion of mariann and her friend in what languag
my answer wa couched?--it must have been onli to one end
my busi wa to declar myself a scoundrel and whether
i did it with a bow or a bluster wa of littl importance--
i am ruin for ever in their opinion-- said i to
myself--i am shut out for ever from their societi
they alreadi think me an unprincipl fellow thi letter
will onli make them think me a blackguard one such were
my reason as in a sort of desper careless
i copi my wife word and part with the last relic
of mariann her three notes--unluckili they were all
in my pocketbook or i should have deni their exist
and hoard them for ever--i wa forc to put them up
and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair--that too
i had alway carri about me in the same pocket-book
which wa now search by madam with the most ingrati
virulence--th dear lock--al everi memento wa torn from me

you are veri wrong mr willoughbi veri blamabl
said elinor while her voic in spite of herself
betray her compassion emotion; you ought not to speak
in thi way either of mr willoughbi or my sister
you had made your own choic it wa not forc on you
your wife ha a claim to your polit to your respect
at least she must be attach to you or she would not
have marri you to treat her with unkind to speak
of her slightingli is no aton to marianne--nor can i
suppos it a relief to your own conscienc

do not talk to me of my wife said he with a heavi sigh--
she doe not deserv your compassion--sh knew i had no
regard for her when we married--wel marri we were
and came down to comb magna to be happi and afterward
return to town to be gay--and now do you piti me
miss dashwood?--or have i said all thi to no purpose?--
am i--b it onli one degree--am i less guilti in your opinion
than i wa before?--mi intent were not alway wrong
have i explain away ani part of my guilt?

ye you have certainli remov something--a little--
you have prove yourself on the whole less faulti than
i had believ you you have prove your heart less wick
much less wick but i hardli know--th miseri that
you have inflicted--i hardli know what could have made
it wors

will you repeat to your sister when she is recov
what i have been tell you?--let me be a littl lighten
too in her opinion as well as in your you tell me that
she ha forgiven me alreadi let me be abl to fanci that
a better knowledg of my heart and of my present feel
will draw from her a more spontan more natur more
gentl less dignifi forgiv tell her of my miseri
and my penitence--tel her that my heart wa never inconst
to her and if you will that at thi moment she is dearer
to me than ever

i will tell her all that is necessari to what may
compar be call your justif but you have
not explain to me the particular reason of your come now
nor how you heard of her ill

last night in druri lane lobbi i ran against sir
john middleton and when he saw who i was--for the first
time these two months--h spoke to me--that he had cut
me ever sinc my marriag i had seen without surpris
or resent now howev hi good-natur honest
stupid soul full of indign against me and concern
for your sister could not resist the temptat of tell
me what he knew ought to--though probabl he did not
think it would--vex me horridli as bluntli as he could
speak it therefor he told me that mariann dashwood
wa die of a putrid fever at cleveland--a letter that
morn receiv from mr jen declar her danger
most imminent--th palmer are all gone off in a fright
&c--i wa too much shock to be abl to pass myself
off as insens even to the undiscern sir john
hi heart wa soften in see mine suffer; and so much
of hi ill-wil wa done away that when we part
he almost shook me by the hand while he remind me of an
old promis about a pointer puppi what i felt on hear
that your sister wa dying--and die too believ me
the greatest villain upon earth scorn hate me
in her latest moments--for how could i tell what horrid
project might not have been imputed? one person i
wa sure would repres me as capabl of ani thing--
what i felt wa dreadful!--mi resolut wa soon made
and at eight oclock thi morn i wa in my carriag
now you know all

elinor made no answer her thought were silent fix
on the irrepar injuri which too earli an independ
and it consequ habit of idl dissip and luxuri
had made in the mind the charact the happi
of a man who to everi advantag of person and talent
unit a disposit natur open and honest and a
feel affection temper the world had made him
extravag and vain--extravag and vaniti had made him
cold-heart and selfish vaniti while seek it own
guilti triumph at the expens of anoth had involv
him in a real attach which extravag or at least
it offspr necess had requir to be sacrif
each faulti propens in lead him to evil had led
him likewis to punish the attach from which
against honour against feel against everi better interest
he had outwardli torn himself now when no longer allow
govern everi thought; and the connect for the sake
of which he had with littl scrupl left her sister
to miseri wa like to prove a sourc of unhappi
to himself of a far more incur natur from a reveri
of thi kind she wa recal at the end of some minut
by willoughbi who rous himself from a reveri at least
equal pain start up in prepar for go and said--

there is no use in stay here; i must be off

are you go back to town?

no--to comb magna i have busi there;
from thenc to town in a day or two good bye

he held out hi hand she could not refus to give
him herss;--h press it with affect

and you do think someth better of me than
you did?--said he let it fall and lean against
the mantel-piec as if forget he wa to go

elinor assur him that she did;--that she forgav
piti wish him well--wa even interest in hi
happiness--and ad some gentl counsel as to the behaviour
most like to promot it hi answer wa not veri encourag

as to that said he i must rub through the world
as well as i can domest happi is out of the question
if howev i am allow to think that you and your feel
an interest in my fate and action it may be the means--it
may put me on my guard--at least it may be someth to
live for mariann to be sure is lost to me for ever
were i even by ani bless chanc at liberti again--

elinor stop him with a reproof

well--h replied--onc more good bye i shall
now go away and live in dread of one event

what do you mean?

your sister marriag

you are veri wrong she can never be more lost
to you than she is now

but she will be gain by some one els and if
that some one should be the veri he whom of all other
i could least bear--but i will not stay to rob myself
of all your compassion goodwil by shew
that where i have most injur i can least forgiv
good bye--god bless you!

and with these word he almost ran out of the room



chapter 45


elinor for some time after he left her for some time
even after the sound of hi carriag had die away remain
too much oppress by a crowd of idea wide differ in
themselv but of which sad wa the gener result
to think even of her sister

willoughbi he whom onli half an hour ago she had
abhor as the most worthless of men willoughbi in spite
of all hi fault excit a degre of commiser
for the suffer produc by them which made her
think of him as now separ for ever from her famili
with a tender a regret rather in proport as she
soon acknowledg within herself--to hi wish than to
hi merit she felt that hi influenc over her mind
wa heighten by circumst which ought not in reason
to have weight; by that person of uncommon attract
that open affection and live manner which it
wa no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love
for mariann which it wa not even innoc to indulg
but she felt that it wa so long long befor she could
feel hi influenc less

when at last she return to the unconsci mariann
she found her just awak refresh by so long and sweet
a sleep to the extent of her hope elinor heart wa full
the past the present the futur willoughbi visit
mariann safeti and her mother expect arriv
threw her altogeth into an agit of spirit
which kept off everi indic of fatigu and made
her onli fear of betray herself to her sister
short wa the time howev in which that fear could
affect her for within half an hour after willoughbi
leav the hous she wa again call down stair
by the sound of anoth carriage--eag to save her
mother from everi unnecessari moment horribl suspens
she ran immedi into the hall and reach the outward
door just in time to receiv and support her as she enter it

mr dashwood whose terror as they drew near the
hous had produc almost the convict of mariann
be no more had no voic to inquir after her
no voic even for elinor; but she wait neither for
salut nor inquiri instantli gave the joy relief;--
and her mother catch it with all her usual warmth
wa in a moment as much overcom by her happi as she
had been befor by her fear she wa support into
the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;--
and there shed tear of joy though still unabl
to speak embrac elinor again and again turn from her
at interv to press colonel brandon hand with a look
which spoke at onc her gratitud and her convict
of hi share with herself in the bliss of the moment
he share it howev in a silenc even greater than her own

as soon as mr dashwood had recov herself
to see mariann wa her first desire; and in two minut she
wa with her belov child render dearer to her than ever
by absenc unhappi and danger elinor delight
as she saw what each felt in the meet wa onli check
by an apprehens of it rob mariann of farther sleep;--
but mr dashwood could be calm could be even prudent
when the life of a child wa at stake and mariann
satisfi in know her mother wa near her and consciou
of be too weak for convers submit readili to the
silenc and quiet prescrib by everi nurs around her
mr dashwood would sit up with her all night; and elinor
in complianc with her mother entreati went to bed
but the rest which one night entir sleepless
and mani hour of the most wear anxieti seem to
make requisit wa kept off by irrit of spirit
willoughbi poor willoughbi as she now allow
herself to call him wa constantli in her thoughts; she
would not but have heard hi vindic for the world
and now blame now acquit herself for have judg him
so harshli befor but her promis of relat it to her
sister wa invari pain she dread the perform
of it dread what it effect on mariann might be;
doubt whether after such an explan she could ever
be happi with another; and for a moment wish willoughbi
a widow then rememb colonel brandon reprov herself
felt that to hi suffer and hi constanc far more
than to hi rival the reward of her sister wa due
and wish ani thing rather than mr willoughbi death

the shock of colonel brandon errand at barton had been
much soften to mr dashwood by her own previou alarm;
for so great wa her uneasi about mariann that she
had alreadi determin to set out for cleveland on that
veri day without wait for ani further intellig
and had so far settl her journey befor hi arriv
that the carey were then expect everi moment to fetch
margaret away as her mother wa unwil to take her
where there might be infect

mariann continu to mend everi day and the brilliant
cheer of mr dashwood look and spirit prove
her to be as she repeatedli declar herself one of
the happiest women in the world elinor could not hear
the declar nor wit it proof without sometim
wonder whether her mother ever recollect edward
but mr dashwood trust to the temper account
of her own disappoint which elinor had sent her
wa led away by the exuber of her joy to think onli
of what would increas it mariann wa restor to her
from a danger in which as she now began to feel
her own mistaken judgment in encourag the unfortun
attach to willoughbi had contribut to place her;--
and in her recoveri she had yet anoth sourc of joy
unthought of by elinor it wa thu impart to her
as soon as ani opportun of privat confer
between them occur

at last we are alon my elinor you do not yet
know all my happi colonel brandon love mariann
he ha told me so himself

her daughter feel by turn both pleas and pain
surpris and not surpris wa all silent attent

you are never like me dear elinor or i should
wonder at your composur now had i sat down to wish
for ani possibl good to my famili i should have fix
on colonel brandon marri one of you as the object
most desir and i believ mariann will be the most
happi with him of the two

elinor wa half inclin to ask her reason for think so
becaus satisfi that none found on an imparti
consider of their age charact or feel
could be given;--but her mother must alway be carri
away by her imagin on ani interest subject
and therefor instead of an inquiri she pass it off with a
smile

he open hi whole heart to me yesterday as we travel
it came out quit unawar quit undesignedli i you may
well believ could talk of noth but my child;--h could
not conceal hi distress; i saw that it equal my own
and he perhap think that mere friendship as the world
now goe would not justifi so warm a sympathy--or rather
not think at all i suppose--giv way to irresist
feel made me acquaint with hi earnest tender constant
affect for mariann he ha love her my elinor ever sinc
the first moment of see her

here howev elinor perceived--not the languag
not the profess of colonel brandon but the natur
embellish of her mother activ fanci which fashion
everi thing delight to her as it chose

hi regard for her infinit surpass anyth
that willoughbi ever felt or feign as much more warm
as more sincer or constant--which ever we are to call it--
ha subsist through all the knowledg of dear mariann
unhappi prepossess for that worthless young man!--and
without selfishness--without encourag a hope!--could
he have seen her happi with another--such a nobl mind!--
such open such sincerity!--no one can be deceiv
in him

colonel brandon charact said elinor
as an excel man is well establish

i know it is--repli her mother serious or
after such a warn i should be the last to encourag
such affect or even to be pleas by it but hi come
for me as he did with such activ such readi friendship
is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men

hi charact howev answer elinor doe not rest
on one act of kind to which hi affect for mariann
were human out of the case would have prompt him
to mr jen to the middleton he ha been long
and intim known; they equal love and respect him;
and even my own knowledg of him though late acquir
is veri considerable; and so highli do i valu and esteem him
that if mariann can be happi with him i shall be as readi
as yourself to think our connect the greatest bless
to us in the world what answer did you give him?--did you
allow him to hope?

oh! my love i could not then talk of hope to him
or to myself mariann might at that moment be die
but he did not ask for hope or encourag hi wa
an involuntari confid an irrepress effus
to a sooth friend--not an applic to a parent
yet after a time i did say for at first i wa quit
overcome--that if she live as i trust she might
my greatest happi would lie in promot their marriage;
and sinc our arriv sinc our delight secur
i have repeat it to him more fulli have given him everi
encourag in my power time a veri littl time
i tell him will do everything;--mariann heart is
not to be wast for ever on such a man as willoughby--
hi own merit must soon secur it

to judg from the colonel spirit howev
you have not yet made him equal sanguin

no--h think mariann affect too deepli
root for ani chang in it under a great length of time
and even suppos her heart again free is too diffid
of himself to believ that with such a differ of age
and disposit he could ever attach her there howev
he is quit mistaken hi age is onli so much beyond
her as to be an advantag as to make hi charact and
principl fixed;--and hi disposit i am well convinc
is exactli the veri one to make your sister happi
and hi person hi manner too are all in hi favour
my partial doe not blind me; he certainli is not
so handsom as willoughby--but at the same time
there is someth much more pleas in hi countenance--
there wa alway a something--if you remember--in willoughbi
eye at time which i did not like

elinor could not rememb it;--but her mother
without wait for her assent continu

and hi manner the colonel manner are not onli
more pleas to me than willoughbi ever were but they
are of a kind i well know to be more solidli attach
to mariann their gentl their genuin attent
to other peopl and their manli unstudi simplic
is much more accord with her real disposit than
the liveliness--often artifici and often ill-tim
of the other i am veri sure myself that had willoughbi
turn out as realli amiabl as he ha prove himself
the contrari mariann would yet never have been so happi
with him as she will be with colonel brandon

she paused--h daughter could not quit agre
with her but her dissent wa not heard and therefor
gave no offenc

at delaford she will be within an easi distanc of me
ad mr dashwood even if i remain at barton; and in all
probability--for i hear it is a larg village--inde there
certainli must be some small hous or cottag close by
that would suit us quit as well as our present situat

poor elinor!--her wa a new scheme for get
her to delaford!--but her spirit wa stubborn

hi fortun too!--for at my time of life you know
everybodi care about that;--and though i neither know
nor desir to know what it realli is i am sure it must be
a good one

here they were interrupt by the entranc of a
third person and elinor withdrew to think it all over
in privat to wish success to her friend and yet
in wish it to feel a pang for willoughbi



chapter 46


mariann ill though weaken in it kind
had not been long enough to make her recoveri slow;
and with youth natur strength and her mother presenc
in aid it proceed so smoothli as to enabl her to remov
within four day after the arriv of the latter
into mr palmer dressing-room when there at her own
particular request for she wa impati to pour forth
her thank to him for fetch her mother colonel brandon
wa invit to visit her

hi emot on enter the room in see her alter
look and in receiv the pale hand which she immedi
held out to him wa such as in elinor conjectur
must aris from someth more than hi affect for mariann
or the conscious of it be known to others;
and she soon discov in hi melancholi eye and vari
complexion as he look at her sister the probabl
recurr of mani past scene of miseri to hi mind
brought back by that resembl between mariann and eliza
alreadi acknowledg and now strengthen by the hollow eye
the sickli skin the postur of reclin weak
and the warm acknowledg of peculiar oblig

mr dashwood not less watch of what pass than
her daughter but with a mind veri differ influenc
and therefor watch to veri differ effect
saw noth in the colonel behaviour but what aros
from the most simpl and self-evid sensat while in
the action and word of mariann she persuad herself
to think that someth more than gratitud alreadi dawn

at the end of anoth day or two mariann grow
visibl stronger everi twelv hour mr dashwood
urg equal by her own and her daughter wish
began to talk of remov to barton on her measur
depend those of her two friends; mr jen could
not quit cleveland dure the dashwood stay; and colonel
brandon wa soon brought by their unit request
to consid hi own abod there as equal determin
if not equal indispens at hi and mr jenningss
unit request in return mr dashwood wa prevail
on to accept the use of hi carriag on her journey back
for the better accommod of her sick child; and the colonel
at the joint invit of mr dashwood and mr jen
whose activ good-natur made her friendli and hospit
for other peopl as well as herself engag with pleasur
to redeem it by a visit at the cottag in the cours
of a few week

the day of separ and departur arrived;
and mariann after take so particular and lengthen
a leav of mr jen one so earnestli grate so full
of respect and kind wish as seem due to her own heart
from a secret acknowledg of past inattent and bid
colonel brandon farewel with a cordial of a friend
wa care assist by him into the carriag of which he
seem anxiou that she should engross at least half
mr dashwood and elinor then follow and the other
were left by themselv to talk of the travel
and feel their own dull till mr jen wa summon
to her chais to take comfort in the gossip of her maid
for the loss of her two young companions; and colonel brandon
immedi afterward took hi solitari way to delaford

the dashwood were two day on the road and mariann
bore her journey on both without essenti fatigu
everi thing that the most zealou affect the most
solicit care could do to render her comfort
wa the offic of each watch companion and each
found their reward in her bodili eas and her calm
of spirit to elinor the observ of the latter
wa particularli grate she who had seen her week
after week so constantli suffer oppress by anguish
of heart which she had neither courag to speak of
nor fortitud to conceal now saw with a joy which no other
could equal share an appar composur of mind which
in be the result as she trust of seriou reflect
must eventu lead her to content and cheer

as they approach barton inde and enter
on scene of which everi field and everi tree brought
some peculiar some pain recollect she grew silent
and thought and turn away her face from their notic
sat earnestli gaze through the window but here
elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw
as she assist mariann from the carriag that she
had been cri she saw onli an emot too natur
in itself to rais ani thing less tender than piti
and in it unobtrus entitl to prais in the
whole of her subsequ manner she trace the direct
of a mind awaken to reason exertion; for no sooner
had they enter their common sitting-room than mariann
turn her eye around it with a look of resolut firm
as if determin at onc to accustom herself to the sight
of everi object with which the remembr of willoughbi could
be connected--sh said littl but everi sentenc aim
at cheer and though a sigh sometim escap her
it never pass away without the aton of a smile
after dinner she would tri her piano-fort she went to it;
but the music on which her eye first rest wa an opera
procur for her by willoughbi contain some of their
favourit duet and bear on it outward leaf her own name
in hi hand-writing--that would not do--sh shook her head
put the music asid and after run over the key
for a minut complain of feebl in her finger
and close the instrument again; declar howev with firm
as she did so that she should in futur practic much

the next morn produc no abat in these
happi symptom on the contrari with a mind and bodi
alik strengthen by rest she look and spoke with
more genuin spirit anticip the pleasur of
margaret return and talk of the dear famili parti
which would then be restor of their mutual pursuit
and cheer societi as the onli happi worth a wish

when the weather is settl and i have recov
my strength said she we will take long walk togeth
everi day we will walk to the farm at the edg of the down
and see how the children go on; we will walk to sir john
new plantat at barton cross and the abbeyland;
and we will often go the old ruin of the priori
and tri to trace it foundat as far as we are told
they onc reach i know we shall be happi i know
the summer will pass happili away i mean never to be
later in rise than six and from that time till dinner
i shall divid everi moment between music and read
i have form my plan and am determin to enter on a cours
of seriou studi our own librari is too well known to me
to be resort to for ani thing beyond mere amus
but there are mani work well worth read at the park;
and there are other of more modern product which i
know i can borrow of colonel brandon by read onli six
hour a-day i shall gain in the cours of a twelve-month
a great deal of instruct which i now feel myself to want

elinor honour her for a plan which origin
so nobli as this; though smile to see the same eager
fanci which had been lead her to the extrem of languid
indol and selfish repin now at work in introduc
excess into a scheme of such ration employ and virtuou
self-control her smile howev chang to a sigh when she
rememb that promis to willoughbi wa yet unfulfil
and fear she had that to commun which might again
unsettl the mind of mariann and ruin at least for a time
thi fair prospect of busi tranquil will therefor
to delay the evil hour she resolv to wait till her
sister health were more secur befor she appoint it
but the resolut wa made onli to be broken

mariann had been two or three day at home befor
the weather wa fine enough for an invalid like herself
to ventur out but at last a soft genial morn appeared;
such as might tempt the daughter wish and the
mother confidence; and mariann lean on elinor arm
wa authoris to walk as long as she could without fatigu
in the lane befor the hous

the sister set out at a pace slow as the feebl
of mariann in an exercis hitherto untri sinc her
ill required;--and they had advanc onli so far
beyond the hous as to admit a full view of the hill
the import hill behind when paus with her eye
turn toward it mariann calmli said

there exactli there--point with one hand
on that project mound--ther i fell; and there
i first saw willoughbi

her voic sunk with the word but present reviv she ad

i am thank to find that i can look with so littl pain
on the spot!--shal we ever talk on that subject elinor?--
hesitatingli it wa said--or will it be wrong?--i can talk
of it now i hope as i ought to do--

elinor tenderli invit her to be open

as for regret said mariann i have done with that
as far as he is concern i do not mean to talk to you
of what my feel have been for him but what they
are now--at present if i could be satisfi on one point
if i could be allow to think that he wa not alway
act a part not alway deceiv me;--but abov all
if i could be assur that he never wa so veri wick
as my fear have sometim fanci him sinc the stori
of that unfortun girl--

she stopt elinor joy treasur her word
as she answer

if you could be assur of that you think you
should be easi

ye my peac of mind is doubli involv in it;--
for not onli is it horribl to suspect a person who ha
been what he ha been to me of such designs--but what must
it make me appear to myself?--what in a situat like mine
but a most shame unguard affect could expos
me to--

how then ask her sister would you account
for hi behaviour?

i would suppos him--oh how gladli would i suppos him
onli fickl veri veri fickl

elinor said no more she wa debat within herself
on the elig of begin her stori directli
or postpon it till mariann were in stronger health;--
and they crept on for a few minut in silenc

i am not wish him too much good said mariann
at last with a sigh when i wish hi secret reflect
may be no more unpleas than my own he will suffer
enough in them

do you compar your conduct with his?

no i compar it with what it ought to have been;
i compar it with your

our situat have born littl resembl

they have born more than our conduct--do not
my dearest elinor let your kind defend what i know
your judgment must censur my ill ha made me think--
it ha given me leisur and calm for seriou recollect
long befor i wa enough recov to talk i wa perfectli
abl to reflect i consid the past: i saw in my
own behaviour sinc the begin of our acquaint
with him last autumn noth but a seri of imprud
toward myself and want of kind to other
i saw that my own feel had prepar my suffer
and that my want of fortitud under them had almost led
me to the grave my ill i well knew had been
entir brought on by myself by such neglig of my
own health as i had felt even at the time to be wrong
had i died--it would have been self-destruct i
did not know my danger till the danger wa removed;
but with such feel as these reflect gave me
i wonder at my recovery--wond that the veri eager
of my desir to live to have time for aton to my god
and to you all did not kill me at onc had i died--
in what peculiar miseri should i have left you my nurs
my friend my sister!--y who had seen all the fret
selfish of my latter days; who had known all the
murmur of my heart!--how should i have live in your
remembrance!--mi mother too! how could you have consol
her!--i cannot express my own abhorr of myself
whenev i look toward the past i saw some duti neglect
or some fail indulg everi bodi seem injur by me
the kind the unceas kind of mr jen
i had repaid with ungrat contempt to the middleton
to the palmer the steel to everi common acquaint even
i had been insol and unjust; with a heart harden
against their merit and a temper irrit by their
veri attention--to john to fanny--y even to them
littl as they deserv i had given less than their due
but you--you abov all abov my mother had been wrong
by me i and onli i knew your heart and it sorrows;
yet to what did it influenc me?--not to ani compass
that could benefit you or myself--your exampl wa
befor me; but to what avail?--wa i more consider
of you and your comfort? did i imit your forbear
or lessen your restraint by take ani part in those
offic of gener complais or particular gratitud
which you had hitherto been left to discharg alone?--no;--
not less when i knew you to be unhappi than when i
had believ you at eas did i turn away from everi
exert of duti or friendship; scarc allow sorrow
to exist but with me regret onli that heart
which had desert and wrong me and leav you
for or i profess an unbound affect to be miser
for my sake

here ceas the rapid flow of her self-reprov spirit;
and elinor impati to sooth though too honest
to flatter gave her instantli that prais and support
which her frank and her contrit so well deserv
mariann press her hand and repli

you are veri good--th futur must be my proof
i have laid down my plan and if i am capabl of adher
to it--mi feel shall be govern and my temper improv
they shall no longer worri other nor tortur myself
i shall now live sole for my famili you my mother
and margaret must henceforth be all the world to me;
you will share my affect entir between you
>from you from my home i shall never again have the smallest
incit to move; and if i do mix in other societi
it will be onli to shew that my spirit is humbl
my heart amend and that i can practis the civil
the lesser duti of life with gentl and forbear
as for willoughby--to say that i shall soon or that i shall
ever forget him would be idl hi remembr can be overcom
by no chang of circumst or opinion but it shall
be regul it shall be check by religion by reason
by constant employ

she paused--and ad in a low voic if i could
but know hi heart everyth would becom easi

elinor who had now been for some time reflect
on the proprieti or improprieti of speedili hazard
her narrat without feel at all nearer decis than
at first heard this; and perceiv that as reflect
did noth resolut must do all soon found herself
lead to the fact

she manag the recit as she hope with address;
prepar her anxiou listen with caution; relat simpli
and honestli the chief point on which willoughbi
ground hi apology; did justic to hi repent
and soften onli hi protest of present regard
mariann said not a word--sh trembl her eye
were fix on the ground and her lip becam whiter
than even sick had left them a thousand inquiri
sprung up from her heart but she dare not urg one
she caught everi syllabl with pant eagerness; her hand
unknowingli to herself close press her sister and
tear cover her cheek

elinor dread her be tire led her toward home;
and till they reach the door of the cottag
easili conjectur what her curios must be
though no question wa suffer to speak it talk of
noth but willoughbi and their convers together;
and wa care minut in everi particular of speech
and look where minut could be safe indulg
as soon as they enter the hous mariann with a kiss
of gratitud and these two word just articul through
her tear tell mama withdrew from her sister and
walk slowli up stair elinor would not attempt
to disturb a solitud so reason as what she now sought;
and with a mind anxious pre-arrang it result
and a resolut of reviv the subject again
should mariann fail to do it she turn into the parlour
to fulfil her part injunct



chapter 47


mr dashwood did not hear unmov the vindic
of her former favourit she rejoic in hi be
clear from some part of hi imput guilt;--sh wa
sorri for him;--sh wish him happi but the feel
of the past could not be recalled--noth could restor
him with a faith unbroken--a charact unblemish
to mariann noth could do away the knowledg
of what the latter had suffer through hi mean
nor remov the guilt of hi conduct toward eliza
noth could replac him therefor in her former esteem
nor injur the interest of colonel brandon

had mr dashwood like her daughter heard willoughbi
stori from himself--had she wit hi distress
and been under the influenc of hi counten and hi
manner it is probabl that her compass would have
been greater but it wa neither in elinor power
nor in her wish to rous such feel in anoth by her
retail explan as had at first been call forth
in herself reflect had given calm to her judgment
and sober her own opinion of willoughbi deserts;--
she wish therefor to declar onli the simpl truth
and lay open such fact as were realli due to hi charact
without ani embellish of tender to lead the
fanci astray

in the even when they were all three togeth
mariann began voluntarili to speak of him again;--
but that it wa not without an effort the restless
unquiet thought in which she had been for some time
previous sitting--h rise colour as she spoke--
and her unsteadi voic plainli shew

i wish to assur you both said she that i see
everi thing--a you can desir me to do

mr dashwood would have interrupt her instantli
with sooth tender had not elinor who realli wish
to hear her sister unbias opinion by an eager sign
engag her silenc mariann slowli continued--

it is a great relief to me--what elinor told
me thi morning--i have now heard exactli what i
wish to hear--for some moment her voic wa lost;
but recov herself she ad and with greater
calm than before--i am now perfectli satisfi
i wish for no chang i never could have been happi
with him after know as sooner or later i must
have known all this--i should have had no confid
no esteem noth could have done it away to my feel

i know it--i know it cri her mother
happi with a man of libertin practices!--with one
who so injur the peac of the dearest of our friend
and the best of men!--no--mi mariann ha not a heart
to be made happi with such a man!--her conscienc her
sensit conscienc would have felt all that the
conscienc of her husband ought to have felt

mariann sigh and repeat i wish for no chang

you consid the matter said elinor exactli as
a good mind and a sound understand must consid it;
and i dare say you perceiv as well as myself not onli
in thi but in mani other circumst reason enough
to be convinc that your marriag must have involv you
in mani certain troubl and disappoint in which
you would have been poorli support by an affect
on hi side much less certain had you marri
you must have been alway poor hi expens is
acknowledg even by himself and hi whole conduct declar
that self-deni is a word hardli understood by him
hi demand and your inexperi togeth on a small
veri small incom must have brought on distress which
would not be the less grievou to you from have been
entir unknown and unthought of befor your sens
of honour and honesti would have led you i know
when awar of your situat to attempt all the economi
that would appear to you possible: and perhap as long
as your frugal retrench onli on your own comfort
you might have been suffer to practic it but beyond that--
and how littl could the utmost of your singl manag
do to stop the ruin which had begun befor your marriage?--
beyond that had you endeavour howev reason
to abridg hi enjoy is it not to be fear that instead
of prevail on feel so selfish to consent to it
you would have lessen your own influenc on hi heart
and made him regret the connect which had involv him
in such difficulties?

mariann lip quiver and she repeat the word
selfish? in a tone that implied--do you realli think
him selfish?

the whole of hi behaviour repli elinor
from the begin to the end of the affair ha been
ground on selfish it wa selfish which first
made him sport with your affections; which afterward
when hi own were engag made him delay the confess
of it and which final carri him from barton
hi own enjoy or hi own eas wa in everi particular
hi rule principl

it is veri true my happi never wa hi object

at present continu elinor he regret what he
ha done and whi doe he regret it?--becaus he find
it ha not answer toward himself it ha not made
him happi hi circumst are now unembarrassed--h
suffer from no evil of that kind; and he think onli
that he ha marri a woman of a less amiabl temper
than yourself but doe it follow that had he marri you
he would have been happy?--th inconveni would have
been differ he would then have suffer under the
pecuniari distress which becaus they are remov
he now reckon as noth he would have had a wife
of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would
have been alway necessitous--alway poor; and probabl
would soon have learn to rank the innumer comfort
of a clear estat and good incom as of far more import
even to domest happi than the mere temper of a wife

i have not a doubt of it said marianne; and i
have noth to regret--noth but my own folli

rather say your mother imprud my child
said mr dashwood; she must be answer

mariann would not let her proceed;--and elinor
satisfi that each felt their own error wish to avoid
ani survey of the past that might weaken her sister
spirits; she therefor pursu the first subject
immedi continu

one observ may i think be fairli drawn from
the whole of the story--that all willoughbi difficulti
have arisen from the first offenc against virtu in hi
behaviour to eliza william that crime ha been the origin
of everi lesser one and of all hi present discont

mariann assent most feelingli to the remark;
and her mother wa led by it to an enumer of colonel
brandon injuri and merit warm as friendship
and design could unitedli dictat her daughter did
not look howev as if much of it were heard by her

elinor accord to her expect saw on the two
or three follow day that mariann did not continu
to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolut
wa unsubdu and she still tri to appear cheer
and easi her sister could safe trust to the effect
of time upon her health

margaret return and the famili were again all
restor to each other again quietli settl at the cottage;
and if not pursu their usual studi with quit
so much vigour as when they first came to barton
at least plan a vigor prosecut of them in futur

elinor grew impati for some tide of edward
she had heard noth of him sinc her leav london
noth new of hi plan noth certain even of hi
present abod some letter had pass between her
and her brother in consequ of mariann illness;
and in the first of john there had been thi sentence:--
we know noth of our unfortun edward and can make no
enquiri on so prohibit a subject but conclud him
to be still at oxford; which wa all the intellig
of edward afford her by the correspond for hi name
wa not even mention in ani of the succeed letter
she wa not doom howev to be long in ignor of
hi measur

their man-serv had been sent one morn to exet
on business; and when as he wait at tabl he had
satisfi the inquiri of hi mistress as to the event
of hi errand thi wa hi voluntari communication--

i suppos you know maam that mr ferrar is marri

mariann gave a violent start fix her eye
upon elinor saw her turn pale and fell back in her
chair in hyster mr dashwood whose eye as she
answer the servant inquiri had intuit taken
the same direct wa shock to perceiv by elinor
counten how much she realli suffer and a moment
afterward alik distress by mariann situat
knew not on which child to bestow her princip attent

the servant who saw onli that miss mariann wa
taken ill had sens enough to call one of the maid
who with mr dashwood assist support her into
the other room by that time mariann wa rather better
and her mother leav her to the care of margaret
and the maid return to elinor who though still
much disord had so far recov the use of her reason
and voic as to be just begin an inquiri of thoma
as to the sourc of hi intellig mr dashwood
immedi took all that troubl on herself; and elinor
had the benefit of the inform without the exert
of seek it

who told you that mr ferrar wa marri thomas?

i see mr ferrar myself maam thi morn
in exet and hi ladi too miss steel as wa they wa
stop in a chais at the door of the new london inn
as i went there with a messag from salli at the park
to her brother who is one of the post-boy i happen
to look up as i went by the chais and so i see directli
it wa the youngest miss steele; so i took off my hat
and she knew me and call to me and inquir after you
maam and the young ladi especi miss mariann
and bid me i should give her compliment and mr ferrarss
their best compliment and servic and how sorri they
wa they had not time to come on and see you but they wa
in a great hurri to go forward for they wa go further
down for a littl while but howsev when they come back
theyd make sure to come and see you

but did she tell you she wa marri thomas?

ye maam she smile and said how she
had chang her name sinc she wa in these part
she wa alway a veri affabl and free-spoken young ladi
and veri civil behav so i made free to wish her joy

wa mr ferrar in the carriag with her?

ye maam i just see him lean back in it
but he did not look up;--h never wa a gentleman much
for talk

elinor heart could easili account for hi not
put himself forward; and mr dashwood probabl
found the same explan

wa there no one els in the carriage?

no maam onli they two

do you know where they came from?

they come straight from town as miss lucy--
mr ferrar told me

and are they go farther westward?

ye maam--but not to bide long they will soon
be back again and then theyd be sure and call here

mr dashwood now look at her daughter;
but elinor knew better than to expect them
she recognis the whole of luci in the messag and wa
veri confid that edward would never come near them
she observ in a low voic to her mother that they
were probabl go down to mr pratt near plymouth

thomass intellig seem over elinor look
as if she wish to hear more

did you see them off befor you came away?

no maam--th hors were just come out but i
could not bide ani longer; i wa afraid of be late

did mr ferrar look well?

ye maam she said how she wa veri well;
and to my mind she wa alway a veri handsom young
lady--and she seem vastli content

mr dashwood could think of no other question
and thoma and the tablecloth now alik needless
were soon afterward dismiss mariann had alreadi sent
to say that she should eat noth more mr dashwood
and elinor appetit were equal lost and margaret
might think herself veri well off that with so much
uneasi as both her sister had late experienc
so much reason as they had often had to be careless
of their meal she had never been oblig to go without
her dinner befor

when the dessert and the wine were arrang
and mr dashwood and elinor were left by themselv
they remain long togeth in a similar of thought
and silenc mr dashwood fear to hazard ani remark
and ventur not to offer consol she now found
that she had er in reli on elinor represent
of herself; and justli conclud that everi thing
had been expressli soften at the time to spare her
from an increas of unhappi suffer as she then
had suffer for mariann she found that she had been
misl by the care the consider attent of
her daughter to think the attach which onc she
had so well understood much slighter in realiti than
she had been wont to believ or than it wa now prove
to be she fear that under thi persuas she had
been unjust inattent nay almost unkind to her elinor;--
that mariann afflict becaus more acknowledg
more immedi befor her had too much engross
her tender and led her away to forget that in elinor
she might have a daughter suffer almost as much
certainli with less self-provoc and greater fortitud



chapter 48


elinor now found the differ between the expect
of an unpleas event howev certain the mind may be told
to consid it and certainti itself she now found that
in spite of herself she had alway admit a hope
while edward remain singl that someth would occur
to prevent hi marri lucy; that some resolut of
hi own some mediat of friend or some more elig
opportun of establish for the ladi would aris
to assist the happi of all but he wa now married;
and she condemn her heart for the lurk flatteri
which so much heighten the pain of the intellig

that he should be marri soon befor (a she imagined)
he could be in order and consequ befor he could
be in possess of the live surpris her a littl
at first but she soon saw how like it wa that luci
in her self-provid care in her hast to secur him
should overlook everi thing but the risk of delay
they were marri marri in town and now hasten
down to her uncl what had edward felt on be within
four mile from barton on see her mother servant
on hear luci message!

they would soon she suppos be settl at
delaford--delaford--that place in which so much
conspir to give her an interest; which she wish
to be acquaint with and yet desir to avoid
she saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw
in luci the activ contriv manag unit at onc
a desir of smart appear with the utmost frugal
and asham to be suspect of half her econom practices;--
pursu her own interest in everi thought court the
favour of colonel brandon of mr jen and of everi
wealthi friend in edward--sh knew not what she saw
nor what she wish to see;--happi or unhappy--noth
pleas her; she turn away her head from everi sketch of him

elinor flatter herself that some one of their
connect in london would write to them to announc
the event and give farther particulars--but day after
day pass off and brought no letter no tide
though uncertain that ani one were to blame she found
fault with everi absent friend they were all thoughtless
or indol

when do you write to colonel brandon maam?
wa an inquiri which sprung from the impati
of her mind to have someth go on

i wrote to him my love last week and rather
expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestli
press hi come to us and should not be surpris
to see him walk in today or tomorrow or ani day

thi wa gain someth someth to look forward to
colonel brandon must have some inform to give

scarc had she so determin it when the figur
of a man on horseback drew her eye to the window
he stopt at their gate it wa a gentleman it
wa colonel brandon himself now she could hear more;
and she trembl in expect of it but--it wa
not colonel brandon--neith hi air--nor hi height
were it possibl she must say it must be edward
she look again he had just dismounted;--sh could not be
mistaken--it wa edward she move away and sat down
he come from mr pratt purpos to see us i will be
calm; i will be mistress of myself

in a moment she perceiv that the other were likewis
awar of the mistak she saw her mother and mariann
chang colour; saw them look at herself and whisper
a few sentenc to each other she would have given
the world to be abl to speak--and to make them understand
that she hope no cool no slight would appear
in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utter
and wa oblig to leav all to their own discret

not a syllabl pass aloud they all wait
in silenc for the appear of their visitor
hi footstep were heard along the gravel path; in a moment
he wa in the passag and in anoth he wa befor them

hi counten as he enter the room wa not
too happi even for elinor hi complexion wa white
with agit and he look as if fear of hi
recept and consciou that he merit no kind one
mr dashwood howev conform as she trust
to the wish of that daughter by whom she then meant
in the warmth of her heart to be guid in everi thing
met with a look of forc complac gave him her hand
and wish him joy

he colour and stammer out an unintellig repli
elinor lip had move with her mother and when the
moment of action wa over she wish that she had shaken
hand with him too but it wa then too late and with a
counten mean to be open she sat down again
and talk of the weather

mariann had retreat as much as possibl
out of sight to conceal her distress; and margaret
understand some part but not the whole of the case
thought it incumb on her to be dignifi and therefor
took a seat as far from him as she could and maintain
a strict silenc

when elinor had ceas to rejoic in the dryness
of the season a veri aw paus took place it wa put
an end to by mr dashwood who felt oblig to hope that he
had left mr ferrar veri well in a hurri manner
he repli in the affirm

anoth paus

elinor resolv to exert herself though fear
the sound of her own voic now said

is mr ferrar at longstaple?

at longstaple! he repli with an air of surprise--
no my mother is in town

i meant said elinor take up some work from
the tabl to inquir for mr edward ferrar

she dare not look up;--but her mother and mariann both
turn their eye on him he colour seem perplex
look doubtingli and after some hesit said--

perhap you mean--mi brother--y mean mrs--mr
robert ferrar

mr robert ferrars!--wa repeat by mariann and her
mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though
elinor could not speak even her eye were fix on him
with the same impati wonder he rose from hi seat
and walk to the window appar from not know
what to do; took up a pair of scissor that lay there
and while spoil both them and their sheath by cut
the latter to piec as he spoke said in a hurri voic

perhap you do not know--you may not have heard
that my brother is late marri to--to the youngest--to
miss luci steel

hi word were echo with unspeak astonish
by all but elinor who sat with her head lean over
her work in a state of such agit as made her hardli
know where she wa

ye said he they were marri last week
and are now at dawlish

elinor could sit it no longer she almost ran
out of the room and as soon as the door wa close
burst into tear of joy which at first she thought would
never ceas edward who had till then look ani where
rather than at her saw her hurri away and perhap saw--
or even heard her emotion; for immedi afterward
he fell into a reveri which no remark no inquiri
no affection address of mr dashwood could penetr
and at last without say a word quit the room
and walk out toward the village--leav the other
in the greatest astonish and perplex on a chang
in hi situat so wonder and so sudden;--a perplex
which they had no mean of lessen but by their
own conjectur



chapter 49


unaccount howev as the circumst of hi
releas might appear to the whole famili it wa certain
that edward wa free; and to what purpos that freedom would
be employ wa easili pre-determin by all;--for after
experienc the bless of one imprud engag
contract without hi mother consent as he had alreadi
done for more than four year noth less could be expect
of him in the failur of that than the immedi contract
of anoth

hi errand at barton in fact wa a simpl one
it wa onli to ask elinor to marri him;--and consid
that he wa not altogeth inexperienc in such a question
it might be strang that he should feel so uncomfort
in the present case as he realli did so much in need of
encourag and fresh air

how soon he had walk himself into the proper
resolut howev how soon an opportun of exercis
it occur in what manner he express himself
and how he wa receiv need not be particularli told
thi onli need be said;--that when they all sat down to
tabl at four oclock about three hour after hi arriv
he had secur hi ladi engag her mother consent
and wa not onli in the raptur profess of
the lover but in the realiti of reason and truth
one of the happiest of men hi situat inde wa
more than commonli joy he had more than the ordinari
triumph of accept love to swell hi heart and rais
hi spirit he wa releas without ani reproach
to himself from an entangl which had long form
hi miseri from a woman whom he had long ceas to love;--
and elev at onc to that secur with anoth
which he must have thought of almost with despair
as soon as he had learnt to consid it with desir
he wa brought not from doubt or suspens but from
miseri to happiness;--and the chang wa openli spoken
in such a genuin flow grate cheer
as hi friend had never wit in him befor

hi heart wa now open to elinor all it weak
all it error confess and hi first boyish attach
to luci treat with all the philosoph digniti of twenty-four

it wa a foolish idl inclin on my side
said he the consequ of ignor of the world--
and want of employ had my brother given me
some activ profess when i wa remov at eighteen
from the care of mr pratt i think--nay i am sure
it would never have happened; for though i left longstapl
with what i thought at the time a most unconquer
prefer for hi niec yet had i then had ani pursuit
ani object to engag my time and keep me at a distanc
from her for a few month i should veri soon have
outgrown the fanci attach especi by mix
more with the world as in such case i must have done
but instead of have ani thing to do instead of have ani
profess chosen for me or be allow to chuse ani myself
i return home to be complet idle; and for the first
twelvemonth afterward i had not even the nomin employ
which belong to the univers would have given me;
for i wa not enter at oxford till i wa nineteen
i had therefor noth in the world to do but to fanci
myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home
in everi respect comfort as i had no friend
no companion in my brother and dislik new acquaint
it wa not unnatur for me to be veri often at longstapl
where i alway felt myself at home and wa alway sure
of a welcome; and accordingli i spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: luci appear
everyth that wa amiabl and oblig she wa pretti
too--at least i thought so then; and i had seen so littl
of other women that i could make no comparison and see
no defect consid everyth therefor i hope
foolish as our engag wa foolish as it ha sinc
in everi way been prove it wa not at the time an unnatur
or an inexcus piec of folli

the chang which a few hour had wrought in the mind
and the happi of the dashwood wa such--so great--a
promis them all the satisfact of a sleepless night
mr dashwood too happi to be comfort knew not how
to love edward nor prais elinor enough how to be enough
thank for hi releas without wound hi delicaci
nor how at onc to give them leisur for unrestrain
convers togeth and yet enjoy as she wish
the sight and societi of both

mariann could speak her happi onli by tear
comparison would occur--regret would arise;--and her joy
though sincer as her love for her sister wa of a kind to
give her neither spirit nor languag

but elinor--how are her feel to be described?--from
the moment of learn that luci wa marri to anoth
that edward wa free to the moment of hi justifi
the hope which had so instantli follow she wa everi
thing by turn but tranquil but when the second moment
had pass when she found everi doubt everi solicitud
remov compar her situat with what so late it
had been--saw him honour releas from hi former
engag saw him instantli profit by the releas
to address herself and declar an affect as tender
as constant as she had ever suppos it to be--sh
wa oppress she wa overcom by her own felicity;--
and happili dispos as is the human mind to be easili
familiar with ani chang for the better it requir
sever hour to give sedat to her spirit or ani
degre of tranquil to her heart

edward wa now fix at the cottag at least for
a week;--for whatev other claim might be made on him
it wa imposs that less than a week should be given
up to the enjoy of elinor compani or suffic
to say half that wa to be said of the past the present
and the future;--for though a veri few hour spent in
the hard labor of incess talk will despatch more
subject than can realli be in common between ani two
ration creatur yet with lover it is differ
between them no subject is finish no commun
is even made till it ha been made at least twenti
time over

luci marriag the unceas and reason wonder
among them all form of cours one of the earliest
discuss of the lovers;--and elinor particular knowledg
of each parti made it appear to her in everi view as one
of the most extraordinari and unaccount circumst
she had ever heard how they could be thrown togeth
and by what attract robert could be drawn on to marri
a girl of whose beauti she had herself heard him speak
without ani admiration--a girl too alreadi engag
to hi brother and on whose account that brother had been
thrown off by hi family--it wa beyond her comprehens
to make out to her own heart it wa a delight affair
to her imagin it wa even a ridicul one but
to her reason her judgment it wa complet a puzzl

edward could onli attempt an explan by suppos
that perhap at first accident meet the vaniti
of the one had been so work on by the flatteri
of the other as to lead by degre to all the rest
elinor rememb what robert had told her in harley street
of hi opinion of what hi own mediat in hi brother
affair might have done if appli to in time
she repeat it to edward

that wa exactli like robert--wa hi immedi
observation--and that he present ad might
perhap be in hi head when the acquaint between
them first began and luci perhap at first might
think onli of procur hi good offic in my favour
other design might afterward aris

how long it had been carri on between them
howev he wa equal at a loss with herself to make out;
for at oxford where he had remain for choic ever sinc
hi quit london he had had no mean of hear of her
but from herself and her letter to the veri last were
neither less frequent nor less affection than usual
not the smallest suspicion therefor had ever occur
to prepar him for what followed;--and when at last it
burst on him in a letter from luci herself he had been
for some time he believ half stupifi between
the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliver
he put the letter into elinor hand

dear sir

be veri sure i have long lost your affect
i have thought myself at liberti to bestow my own
on anoth and have no doubt of be as happi with
him as i onc use to think i might be with you;
but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart wa
anoth sincer wish you happi in your choic
and it shall not be my fault if we are not alway
good friend as our near relationship now make
proper i can safe say i owe you no ill-wil
and am sure you will be too gener to do us ani
ill offic your brother ha gain my affect
entir and as we could not live without one
anoth we are just return from the altar and
are now on our way to dawlish for a few week which
place your dear brother ha great curios to see
but thought i would first troubl you with these
few line and shall alway remain

your sincer well-wish friend and sister
luci ferrar

i have burnt all your letter and will return
your pictur the first opportun pleas to destroy
my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are veri
welcom to keep

elinor read and return it without ani comment

i will not ask your opinion of it as a composit
said edward--for world would not i have had a letter
of her seen by you in former days--in a sister it
is bad enough but in a wife!--how i have blush over
the page of her writing!--and i believ i may say that
sinc the first half year of our foolish--business--thi
is the onli letter i ever receiv from her of which
the substanc made me ani amend for the defect of the style

howev it may have come about said elinor
after a pause--they are certainli marri and your mother
ha brought on herself a most appropri punish
the independ she settl on robert through resent
against you ha put it in hi power to make hi own choice;
and she ha actual been bribe one son with a thousand
a-year to do the veri deed which she disinherit the
other for intend to do she will hardli be less hurt
i suppos by robert marri luci than she would have
been by your marri her

she will be more hurt by it for robert alway
wa her favourite--sh will be more hurt by it
and on the same principl will forgiv him much sooner

in what state the affair stood at present between them
edward knew not for no commun with ani of hi famili
had yet been attempt by him he had quit oxford
within four and twenti hour after luci letter arriv
and with onli one object befor him the nearest road
to barton had had no leisur to form ani scheme of conduct
with which that road did not hold the most intim connect
he could do noth till he were assur of hi fate with
miss dashwood; and by hi rapid in seek that fate
it is to be suppos in spite of the jealousi with
which he had onc thought of colonel brandon in spite
of the modesti with which he rate hi own desert
and the polit with which he talk of hi doubt
he did not upon the whole expect a veri cruel recept
it wa hi busi howev to say that he did and he
said it veri prettili what he might say on the subject
a twelvemonth after must be refer to the imagin
of husband and wive

that luci had certainli meant to deceiv to go off
with a flourish of malic against him in her messag
by thoma wa perfectli clear to elinor; and edward himself
now thoroughli enlighten on her charact had no
scrupl in believ her capabl of the utmost mean
of wanton ill-natur though hi eye had been long open
even befor hi acquaint with elinor began to her
ignor and a want of liber in some of her opinions--
they had been equal imput by him to her want
of education; and till her last letter reach him
he had alway believ her to be a well-dispos
good-heart girl and thoroughli attach to himself
noth but such a persuas could have prevent
hi put an end to an engag which long befor
the discoveri of it laid him open to hi mother anger
had been a continu sourc of disquiet and regret to him

i thought it my duti said he independ of my feel
to give her the option of continu the engag or not
when i wa renounc by my mother and stood to all
appear without a friend in the world to assist me
in such a situat as that where there seem noth
to tempt the avaric or the vaniti of ani live creatur
how could i suppos when she so earnestli so warmli insist
on share my fate whatev it might be that ani thing
but the most disinterest affect wa her inducement?
and even now i cannot comprehend on what motiv she act
or what fanci advantag it could be to her to be
fetter to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard
and who had onli two thousand pound in the world
she could not forese that colonel brandon would give me a
live

no; but she might suppos that someth would occur
in your favour; that your own famili might in time relent
and at ani rate she lost noth by continu the engag
for she ha prove that it fetter neither her inclin
nor her action the connect wa certainli a
respect one and probabl gain her consider among
her friends; and if noth more advantag occur
it would be better for her to marri you than be singl

edward wa of cours immedi convinc that
noth could have been more natur than luci conduct
nor more self-evid than the motiv of it

elinor scold him harshli as ladi alway scold
the imprud which compliment themselv for have
spent so much time with them at norland when he must
have felt hi own inconst

your behaviour wa certainli veri wrong said she;
because--to say noth of my own convict our relat
were all led away by it to fanci and expect what as you
were then situat could never be

he could onli plead an ignor of hi own heart
and a mistaken confid in the forc of hi engag

i wa simpl enough to think that becaus my faith
wa plight to anoth there could be no danger in my be
with you; and that the conscious of my engag wa
to keep my heart as safe and sacr as my honour i felt
that i admir you but i told myself it wa onli friendship;
and till i began to make comparison between yourself
and luci i did not know how far i wa got after that
i suppos i wa wrong in remain so much in sussex
and the argument with which i reconcil myself to the
expedi of it were no better than these:--th danger
is my own; i am do no injuri to anybodi but myself

elinor smile and shook her head

edward heard with pleasur of colonel brandon
be expect at the cottag as he realli wish
not onli to be better acquaint with him but to have an
opportun of convinc him that he no longer resent
hi give him the live of delaford--which at present
said he after thank so ungraci deliv as mine
were on the occas he must think i have never forgiven
him for offer

now he felt astonish himself that he had never yet
been to the place but so littl interest had be taken
in the matter that he owe all hi knowledg of the hous
garden and glebe extent of the parish condit of
the land and rate of the tith to elinor herself
who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon
and heard it with so much attent as to be entir
mistress of the subject

one question after thi onli remain undecid
between them one difficulti onli wa to be overcom
they were brought togeth by mutual affect
with the warmest approb of their real friends;
their intim knowledg of each other seem to make
their happi certain--and they onli want someth
to live upon edward had two thousand pound and elinor
one which with delaford live wa all that they could
call their own; for it wa imposs that mr dashwood
should advanc anything; and they were neither of them
quit enough in love to think that three hundr and fifti
pound a-year would suppli them with the comfort of life

edward wa not entir without hope of some
favour chang in hi mother toward him; and on that
he rest for the residu of their incom but elinor
had no such dependence; for sinc edward would still
be unabl to marri miss morton and hi chuse herself
had been spoken of in mr ferrarss flatter languag
as onli a lesser evil than hi chuse luci steel
she fear that robert offenc would serv no other
purpos than to enrich fanni

about four day after edward arriv colonel
brandon appear to complet mr dashwood satisfact
and to give her the digniti of have for the first time
sinc her live at barton more compani with her than
her hous would hold edward wa allow to retain the
privileg of first comer and colonel brandon therefor
walk everi night to hi old quarter at the park;
from whenc he usual return in the morn earli enough
to interrupt the lover first tete-a-tet befor breakfast

a three week resid at delaford where
in hi even hour at least he had littl to do
but to calcul the disproport between thirty-six
and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind
which need all the improv in mariann look
all the kind of her welcom and all the encourag
of her mother languag to make it cheer
among such friend howev and such flatteri he did reviv
no rumour of luci marriag had yet reach him:--h knew
noth of what had passed; and the first hour of hi
visit were consequ spent in hear and in wonder
everi thing wa explain to him by mr dashwood
and he found fresh reason to rejoic in what he had done
for mr ferrar sinc eventu it promot the interest
of elinor

it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanc
in the good opinion of each other as they advanc in each
other acquaint for it could not be otherwis
their resembl in good principl and good sens
in disposit and manner of think would probabl
have been suffici to unit them in friendship
without ani other attraction; but their be in love
with two sister and two sister fond of each other
made that mutual regard inevit and immedi
which might otherwis have wait the effect of time
and judgment

the letter from town which a few day befor would
have made everi nerv in elinor bodi thrill with transport
now arriv to be read with less emot that mirth
mr jen wrote to tell the wonder tale to vent her
honest indign against the jilt girl and pour forth
her compass toward poor mr edward who she wa sure
had quit dote upon the worthless hussi and wa now
by all account almost broken-heart at oxford--
i do think she continu noth wa ever carri
on so sly; for it wa but two day befor luci call
and sat a coupl of hour with me not a soul suspect
anyth of the matter not even nanci who poor soul!
came cri to me the day after in a great fright
for fear of mr ferrar as well as not know how to
get to plymouth; for luci it seem borrow all her
money befor she went off to be marri on purpos
we suppos to make a show with and poor nanci had not
seven shill in the world;--so i wa veri glad to give
her five guinea to take her down to exet where she
think of stay three or four week with mr burgess
in hope as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again
and i must say that luci cross not to take them
along with them in the chais is wors than all
poor mr edward! i cannot get him out of my head but you
must send for him to barton and miss mariann must tri to
comfort him

mr dashwood strain were more solemn
mr ferrar wa the most unfortun of women--poor
fanni had suffer agoni of sensibility--and he
consid the exist of each under such a blow
with grate wonder robert offenc wa unpardon
but luci wa infinit wors neither of them were
ever again to be mention to mr ferrars; and even
if she might hereaft be induc to forgiv her son
hi wife should never be acknowledg as her daughter
nor be permit to appear in her presenc the secreci
with which everyth had been carri on between them
wa ration treat as enorm heighten
the crime becaus had ani suspicion of it occur
to the other proper measur would have been taken
to prevent the marriage; and he call on elinor to join
with him in regret that luci engag with edward
had not rather been fulfil than that she should thu
be the mean of spread miseri farther in the family--
he thu continued:

mr ferrar ha never yet mention edward name
which doe not surpris us; but to our great astonish
not a line ha been receiv from him on the occas
perhap howev he is kept silent by hi fear of offend
and i shall therefor give him a hint by a line
to oxford that hi sister and i both think a letter
of proper submiss from him address perhap to fanni
and by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss;
for we all know the tender of mr ferrarss heart
and that she wish for noth so much as to be on good term
with her children

thi paragraph wa of some import to the
prospect and conduct of edward it determin him
to attempt a reconcili though not exactli
in the manner point out by their brother and sister

a letter of proper submission! repeat he;
would they have me beg my mother pardon for robert
ingratitud to her and breach of honour to me?--i can
make no submission--i am grown neither humbl nor
penit by what ha passed--i am grown veri happy;
but that would not interest--i know of no submiss
that is proper for me to make

you may certainli ask to be forgiven said elinor
becaus you have offended;--and i should think you
might now ventur so far as to profess some concern
for have ever form the engag which drew on you
your mother anger

he agre that he might

and when she ha forgiven you perhap a littl humil
may be conveni while acknowledg a second engag
almost as imprud in her eye as the first

he had noth to urg against it but still
resist the idea of a letter of proper submission;
and therefor to make it easier to him as he declar
a much greater willing to make mean concess
by word of mouth than on paper it wa resolv that
instead of write to fanni he should go to london
and person intreat her good offic in hi favour--
and if they realli do interest themselv said mariann
in her new charact of candour in bring about
a reconcili i shall think that even john and fanni
are not entir without merit

after a visit on colonel brandon side of onli three
or four day the two gentlemen quit barton together--
they were to go immedi to delaford that edward
might have some person knowledg of hi futur home
and assist hi patron and friend in decid on what
improv were need to it; and from thenc
after stay there a coupl of night he wa to proceed
on hi journey to town



chapter 50


after a proper resist on the part of mr ferrar
just so violent and so steadi as to preserv her from that
reproach which she alway seem fear of incur
the reproach of be too amiabl edward wa admit
to her presenc and pronounc to be again her son

her famili had of late been exceedingli fluctuat
for mani year of her life she had had two sons;
but the crime and annihil of edward a few week ago
had rob her of one; the similar annihil of robert
had left her for a fortnight without any; and now
by the resuscit of edward she had one again

in spite of hi be allow onc more to live
howev he did not feel the continu of hi exist
secur till he had reveal hi present engagement;
for the public of that circumst he fear
might give a sudden turn to hi constitut and carri
him off as rapidli as befor with apprehens caution
therefor it wa reveal and he wa listen to with
unexpect calm mr ferrar at first reason
endeavour to dissuad him from marri miss dashwood
by everi argument in her power;--told him that in miss morton
he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--
and enforc the assert by observ that miss morton
wa the daughter of a nobleman with thirti thousand pound
while miss dashwood wa onli the daughter of a privat
gentleman with no more than three; but when she found that
though perfectli admit the truth of her represent
he wa by no mean inclin to be guid by it
she judg it wisest from the experi of the past
to submit--and therefor after such an ungraci delay
as she owe to her own digniti and as serv to prevent
everi suspicion of good-wil she issu her decre
of consent to the marriag of edward and elinor

what she would engag to do toward augment
their incom wa next to be considered; and here it
plainli appear that though edward wa now her onli son
he wa by no mean her eldest; for while robert wa
inevit endow with a thousand pound a-year
not the smallest object wa made against edward take
order for the sake of two hundr and fifti at the utmost;
nor wa anyth promis either for the present or in futur
beyond the ten thousand pound which had been given with fanni

it wa as much howev as wa desir
and more than wa expect by edward and elinor;
and mr ferrar herself by her shuffl excus
seem the onli person surpris at her not give more

with an incom quit suffici to their want
thu secur to them they had noth to wait for
after edward wa in possess of the live but the
readi of the hous to which colonel brandon
with an eager desir for the accommod of elinor
wa make consider improvements; and after wait
some time for their complet after experienc
as usual a thousand disappoint and delay
from the unaccount dilatori of the workmen elinor
as usual broke through the first posit resolut
of not marri till everi thing wa readi and the
ceremoni took place in barton church earli in the autumn

the first month after their marriag wa spent
with their friend at the mansion-house; from whenc
they could superintend the progress of the parsonag
and direct everi thing as they like on the spot;--
could chuse paper project shrubberi and invent a sweep
mr jenningss propheci though rather jumbl togeth
were chiefli fulfilled; for she wa abl to visit edward
and hi wife in their parsonag by michaelma and she
found in elinor and her husband as she realli believ
one of the happiest coupl in the world they had
in fact noth to wish for but the marriag of colonel
brandon and mariann and rather better pasturag for
their cow

they were visit on their first settl by almost
all their relat and friend mr ferrar came
to inspect the happi which she wa almost asham
of have authorised; and even the dashwood were at
the expens of a journey from sussex to do them honour

i will not say that i am disappoint my dear sister
said john as they were walk togeth one morn befor
the gate of delaford hous that would be say too much
for certainli you have been one of the most fortun young
women in the world as it is but i confess it would
give me great pleasur to call colonel brandon brother
hi properti here hi place hi hous everi thing is in
such respect and excel condition!--and hi woods!--i
have not seen such timber ani where in dorsetshir as there
is now stand in delaford hanger!--and though perhap
mariann may not seem exactli the person to attract him--
yet i think it would altogeth be advis for you to
have them now frequent stay with you for as colonel
brandon seem a great deal at home nobodi can tell what
may happen--for when peopl are much thrown togeth
and see littl of anybodi else--and it will alway be
in your power to set her off to advantag and so forth;--
in short you may as well give her a chance--y understand
me--

but though mr ferrar did come to see them and alway
treat them with the make-believ of decent affect
they were never insult by her real favour and prefer
that wa due to the folli of robert and the cun
of hi wife; and it wa earn by them befor mani month
had pass away the selfish sagac of the latter
which had at first drawn robert into the scrape
wa the princip instrument of hi deliver from it;
for her respect humil assidu attent
and endless flatteri as soon as the smallest open
wa given for their exercis reconcil mr ferrar
to hi choic and re-establish him complet in
her favour

the whole of luci behaviour in the affair
and the prosper which crown it therefor may be held
forth as a most encourag instanc of what an earnest
an unceas attent to self-interest howev it progress
may be appar obstruct will do in secur everi
advantag of fortun with no other sacrific than that of time
and conscienc when robert first sought her acquaint
and privat visit her in bartlett build
it wa onli with the view imput to him by hi brother
he mere meant to persuad her to give up the engagement;
and as there could be noth to overcom but the affect
of both he natur expect that one or two interview
would settl the matter in that point howev
and that onli he erred;--for though luci soon gave him
hope that hi eloqu would convinc her in time
anoth visit anoth convers wa alway want
to produc thi convict some doubt alway linger
in her mind when they part which could onli be
remov by anoth half hour discours with himself
hi attend wa by thi mean secur and the rest
follow in cours instead of talk of edward
they came gradual to talk onli of robert--a subject
on which he had alway more to say than on ani other
and in which she soon betray an interest even equal
to hi own; and in short it becam speedili evid
to both that he had entir supplant hi brother
he wa proud of hi conquest proud of trick edward
and veri proud of marri privat without hi
mother consent what immedi follow is known
they pass some month in great happi at dawlish;
for she had mani relat and old acquaint to
cut--and he drew sever plan for magnific cottages;--
and from thenc return to town procur the forgiv
of mr ferrar by the simpl expedi of ask it
which at luci instig wa adopt the forgiv
at first inde as wa reason comprehend onli robert;
and luci who had owe hi mother no duti and therefor
could have transgress none still remain some week
longer unpardon but persever in humil of conduct
and messag in self-condemn for robert offenc
and gratitud for the unkind she wa treat with
procur her in time the haughti notic which overcam
her by it gracious and led soon afterward by rapid
degre to the highest state of affect and influenc
luci becam as necessari to mr ferrar as either robert
or fanny; and while edward wa never cordial forgiven
for have onc intend to marri her and elinor
though superior to her in fortun and birth wa spoken
of as an intrud she wa in everi thing consid
and alway openli acknowledg to be a favourit child
they settl in town receiv veri liber assist
from mr ferrar were on the best term imagin
with the dashwoods; and set asid the jealousi
and ill-wil continu subsist between fanni and luci
in which their husband of cours took a part as well
as the frequent domest disagr between robert and
luci themselv noth could exceed the harmoni in which
they all live togeth

what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest
son might have puzzl mani peopl to find out; and what
robert had done to succeed to it might have puzzl them
still more it wa an arrang howev justifi in
it effect if not in it cause; for noth ever
appear in robert style of live or of talk to give
a suspicion of hi regret the extent of hi incom
as either leav hi brother too littl or bring
himself too much;--and if edward might be judg from
the readi discharg of hi duti in everi particular
from an increas attach to hi wife and hi home
and from the regular cheer of hi spirit
he might be suppos no less content with hi lot
no less free from everi wish of an exchang

elinor marriag divid her as littl from her
famili as could well be contriv without render
the cottag at barton entir useless for her mother
and sister spent much more than half their time with her
mr dashwood wa act on motiv of polici as well
as pleasur in the frequenc of her visit at delaford;
for her wish of bring mariann and colonel brandon togeth
wa hardli less earnest though rather more liber than
what john had express it wa now her darl object
preciou as wa the compani of her daughter to her
she desir noth so much as to give up it constant
enjoy to her valu friend; and to see mariann settl at
the mansion-hous wa equal the wish of edward and elinor
they each felt hi sorrow and their own oblig
and mariann by gener consent wa to be the reward
of all

with such a confederaci against her--with a knowledg
so intim of hi goodness--with a convict of hi fond
attach to herself which at last though long after it
wa observ to everybodi else--burst on her--what could she
do?

mariann dashwood wa born to an extraordinari fate
she wa born to discov the falsehood of her own opinion
and to counteract by her conduct her most favourit maxim
she wa born to overcom an affect form so late
in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and live friendship
voluntarili to give her hand to another!--and that other
a man who had suffer no less than herself under the
event of a former attach whom two year befor
she had consid too old to be married--and who still
sought the constitut safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!

but so it wa instead of fall a sacrific
to an irresist passion as onc she had fondli
flatter herself with expecting--instead of remain
even for ever with her mother and find her onli
pleasur in retir and studi as afterward in her
more calm and sober judgment she had determin on--
she found herself at nineteen submit to new attach
enter on new duti place in a new home a wife
the mistress of a famili and the patro of a villag

colonel brandon wa now as happi as all those who best
love him believ he deserv to be;--in mariann he
wa consol for everi past affliction;--h regard and her
societi restor hi mind to anim and hi spirit
to cheerfulness; and that mariann found her own happi
in form hi wa equal the persuas and delight
of each observ friend mariann could never love
by halves; and her whole heart becam in time as much
devot to her husband as it had onc been to willoughbi

willoughbi could not hear of her marriag without
a pang; and hi punish wa soon afterward complet
in the voluntari forgiv of mr smith who by state
hi marriag with a woman of charact as the sourc
of her clemenc gave him reason for believ that had he
behav with honour toward mariann he might at onc have
been happi and rich that hi repent of misconduct
which thu brought it own punish wa sincer
need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of colonel
brandon with envi and of mariann with regret but that
he wa for ever inconsol that he fled from societi
or contract an habitu gloom of temper or die of a
broken heart must not be depend on--for he did neither
he live to exert and frequent to enjoy himself
hi wife wa not alway out of humour nor hi home
alway uncomfortable; and in hi breed of hors and dog
and in sport of everi kind he found no inconsider
degre of domest felic

for mariann however--in spite of hi incivil
in surviv her loss--h alway retain that decid
regard which interest him in everi thing that befel her
and made her hi secret standard of perfect in woman;--
and mani a rise beauti would be slight by him in
after-day as bear no comparison with mr brandon

mr dashwood wa prudent enough to remain at the cottag
without attempt a remov to delaford; and fortun for
sir john and mr jen when mariann wa taken from them
margaret had reach an age highli suitabl for danc
and not veri inelig for be suppos to have a lover

between barton and delaford there wa that constant
commun which strong famili affect would
natur dictate;--and among the merit and the happi
of elinor and mariann let it not be rank as the least
consider that though sister and live almost within
sight of each other they could live without disagr
between themselv or produc cool between their husband

the end
