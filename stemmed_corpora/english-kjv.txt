and the chief butler told hi dream to joseph and said to
him in my dream behold a vine wa befor me;
and in the vine were three branches: and it wa as though it
bud and her blossom shot forth; and the cluster thereof
brought forth ripe grap
and pharaoh cup wa in my hand: and i took the grape and
press them into pharaoh cup and i gave the cup into
pharaoh hand
and joseph said unto him thi is the interpret of it:
the three branch are three da
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thine head and
restor thee unto thi pla and thou shalt deliv pharaoh
cup into hi hand after the former manner when thou wast hi
butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew
kind i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto
pharaoh and bring me out of thi hou
for inde i wa stolen away out of the land of the hebrews:
and here also have i done noth that they should put me into

when the chief baker saw that the interpret wa good he
said unto joseph i also wa in my dream and behold i had
three white basket on my he

bakemeat for pharaoh; and the bird did eat them out of the
basket upon my head
and joseph answer and said thi is the interpret
there the three basket are three days:
yet within three day shall pharaoh lift up thi head from off
thee and shall hang thee on a tree; and the bird shall eat
thi flesh from off thee

and he restor the chief butler unto hi butlership again;
and he gave the cup into pharaoh ha
but he hang the chief baker: as joseph had interpret to

yet did not the chief butler rememb joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full year that pharaoh
dream and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well
favour kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the
river ill favour and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
kine upon the brink of the river
and the ill favour and leanflesh kine did eat up the seven
well favour and fat kine so pharaoh awok
and he slept and dream the second time: and behold seven
ear of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ear and blast with the east wind
sprung up after them
and the seven thin ear devour the seven rank and full ear
and pharaoh awok and behold it wa a dream
and it came to pass in the morn that hi spirit wa
troubled; and he sent and call for all the magician of
egypt and all the wise men there and pharaoh told them hi
dream; but there wa none that could interpret them unto
pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh say i do
rememb my fault thi d
pharaoh wa wroth with hi servant and put me in ward in the
captain of the guard hous both me and the chief bak
and we dream a dream in one night i and he; we dream each
man accord to the interpret of hi dream
and there wa there with us a young man an hebrew servant to
the captain of the guard; and we told him and he interpret
to us our dreams; to each man accord to hi dream he did
interpret
and it came to pass as he interpret to us so it was; me he
restor unto mine offic and him he hang
then pharaoh sent and call joseph and they brought him
hastili out of the dung and he shave himself and chang
hi raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dream a dream and
there is none that can interpret and i have heard say of
thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answer pharaoh say it is not in me: god
shall give pharaoh an answer of peac
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood
upon the bank of the riv
and behold there came up out of the river seven kine
fatflesh and well favoured; and they fed in a mead
and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and
veri ill favour and leanflesh such as i never saw in all
the land of egypt for badn
and the lean and the ill favour kine did eat up the first
seven fat ki
and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that
they had eaten them; but they were still ill favour as at
the begin so i awok
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ear came up in one
stalk full and go
and behold seven ear wither thin and blast with the
east wind sprung up after th
and the thin ear devour the seven good ears: and i told
thi unto the magicians; but there wa none that could declar
it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one: god
hath shew pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ear
are seven yea the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favour kine that came up after
them are seven years; and the seven empti ear blast with
the east wind shall be seven year of famin
thi is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh: what god
is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven year of great plenti throughout all
the land of egi
and there shall aris after them seven year of famine; and
all the plenti shall be forgotten in the land of egypt; and
the famin shall consum the land;
and the plenti shall not be known in the land by reason of
that famin following; for it shall be veri grievou
and for that the dream wa doubl unto pharaoh twice; it is
becaus the thing is establish by god and god will shortli
bring it to pass
now therefor let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise
and set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do thi and let him appoint offic over the
land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the
seven plenteou year
and let them gather all the food of those good year that
come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them
keep food in the citi
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
year of famin which shall be in the land of egypt; that the
land perish not through the famin

and he said god forbid that i should do so: but the man in
