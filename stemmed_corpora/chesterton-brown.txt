[the wisdom of father brown by g k chesterton 1914]


i the absenc of mr glass


the consulting-room of dr orion hood the emin criminologist
and specialist in certain moral disord lay along the sea-front
at scarborough in a seri of veri larg and well-light french window
which show the north sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marbl
in such a place the sea had someth of the monotoni of a blue-green dado:
for the chamber themselv were rule throughout by a terribl tidi
not unlik the terribl tidi of the sea it must not be suppos
that dr hood apart exclud luxuri or even poetri
these thing were there in their place; but one felt that
they were never allow out of their place luxuri wa there:
there stood upon a special tabl eight or ten box of the best cigars;
but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were alway
nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window a tantalu
contain three kind of spirit all of a liqueur excel
stood alway on thi tabl of luxury; but the fanci have assert
that the whiski brandi and rum seem alway to stand at the same level
poetri wa there: the left-hand corner of the room wa line with
as complet a set of english classic as the right hand could show
of english and foreign physiologist but if one took a volum
of chaucer or shelley from that rank it absenc irrit the mind
like a gap in a man front teeth one could not say the book
were never read; probabl they were but there wa a sens of their
be chain to their place like the bibl in the old church
dr hood treat hi privat book-shelf as if it were a public librari
and if thi strict scientif intang steep even the shelv
laden with lyric and ballad and the tabl laden with drink and tobacco
it goe without say that yet more of such heathen holi
protect the other shelv that held the specialist librari
and the other tabl that sustain the frail and even fairylik
instrument of chemistri or mechan

dr hood pace the length of hi string of apart bounded--
as the boy geographi say--on the east by the north sea and on the west
by the serri rank of hi sociolog and criminologist librari
he wa clad in an artist velvet but with none of an artist negligence;
hi hair wa heavili shot with grey but grow thick and healthy;
hi face wa lean but sanguin and expect everyth about him
and hi room indic someth at onc rigid and restless
like that great northern sea by which (on pure principl of hygiene)
he had built hi home

fate be in a funni mood push the door open and
introduc into those long strict sea-flank apart
one who wa perhap the most startl opposit of them and their master
in answer to a curt but civil summon the door open inward
and there shambl into the room a shapeless littl figur
which seem to find it own hat and umbrella as unmanag as
a mass of luggag the umbrella wa a black and prosaic bundl
long past repair; the hat wa a broad-curv black hat cleric
but not common in england; the man wa the veri embodi of all
that is home and helpless

the doctor regard the new-com with a restrain astonish
not unlik that he would have shown if some huge but obvious
harmless sea-beast had crawl into hi room the new-com
regard the doctor with that beam but breathless genial
which character a corpul charwoman who ha just manag
to stuff herself into an omnibu it is a rich confus of
social self-congratul and bodili disarray hi hat tumbl
to the carpet hi heavi umbrella slip between hi knee with a thud;
he reach after the one and duck after the other but with
an unimpair smile on hi round face spoke simultan as follows:

my name is brown pray excus me ive come about
that busi of the macnab i have heard you often help peopl
out of such troubl pray excus me if i am wrong

by thi time he had sprawlingli recov the hat and made
an odd littl bob bow over it as if set everyth quit right

i hardli understand you repli the scientist with
a cold intens of manner i fear you have mistaken the chamber
i am dr hood and my work is almost entir literari and educ
it is true that i have sometim been consult by the polic
in case of peculiar difficulti and import but--

oh thi is of the greatest import broke in the littl man
call brown whi her mother wont let them get engag
and he lean back in hi chair in radiant ration

the brow of dr hood were drawn down darkli but the eye
under them were bright with someth that might be anger or
might be amus and still he said i do not quit understand

you see they want to get marri said the man with the
cleric hat maggi macnab and young todhunt want to get marri
now what can be more import than that?

the great orion hood scientif triumph had depriv him
of mani things--som said of hi health other of hi god;
but they had not wholli despoil him of hi sens of the absurd
at the last plea of the ingenu priest a chuckl broke out of him
from insid and he threw himself into an arm-chair in an iron attitud
of the consult physician

mr brown he said grave it is quit fourteen and a half year
sinc i wa person ask to test a person problem: then it wa
the case of an attempt to poison the french presid at
a lord mayor banquet it is now i understand a question of whether
some friend of your call maggi is a suitabl fiance for some friend
of her call todhunt well mr brown i am a sportsman
i will take it on i will give the macnab famili my best advic
as good as i gave the french republ and the king of england--no better:
fourteen year better i have noth els to do thi afternoon
tell me your stori

the littl clergyman call brown thank him with
unquestion warmth but still with a queer kind of simplic
it wa rather as if he were thank a stranger in a smoking-room
for some troubl in pass the match than as if he were (a he was)
practic thank the curat of kew garden for come with him
into a field to find a four-leav clover with scarc a semi-colon
after hi hearti thank the littl man began hi recital:

i told you my name wa brown; well that the fact
and im the priest of the littl cathol church i dare say youv seen
beyond those straggli street where the town end toward the north
in the last and straggliest of those street which run along the sea
like a sea-wal there is a veri honest but rather sharp-temp
member of my flock a widow call macnab she ha one daughter
and she let lodg and between her and the daughter
and between her and the lodgers--wel i dare say there is a great deal
to be said on both side at present she ha onli one lodger
the young man call todhunter; but he ha given more troubl
than all the rest for he want to marri the young woman of the hous

and the young woman of the hous ask dr hood with huge and
silent amus what doe she want?

whi she want to marri him cri father brown sit up eagerli
that is just the aw complic

it is inde a hideou enigma said dr hood

thi young jame todhunt continu the cleric
is a veri decent man so far as i know; but then nobodi know veri much
he is a bright brownish littl fellow agil like a monkey
clean-shaven like an actor and oblig like a born courtier
he seem to have quit a pocket of money but nobodi know what
hi trade is mr macnab therefor (be of a pessimist turn)
is quit sure it is someth dread and probabl connect with dynamit
the dynamit must be of a shi and noiseless sort for the poor fellow
onli shut himself up for sever hour of the day and studi someth
behind a lock door he declar hi privaci is temporari and justifi
and promis to explain befor the wed that is all that anyon know
for certain but mr macnab will tell you a great deal more than
even she is certain of you know how the tale grow like grass on
such a patch of ignor as that there are tale of two voic
heard talk in the room; though when the door is open
todhunt is alway found alon there are tale of a mysteri
tall man in a silk hat who onc came out of the sea-mist and
appar out of the sea step softli across the sandi field and
through the small back garden at twilight till he wa heard
talk to the lodger at hi open window the colloquy seem to end
in a quarrel todhunt dash down hi window with violenc
and the man in the high hat melt into the sea-fog again
thi stori is told by the famili with the fiercest mystification;
but i realli think mr macnab prefer her own origin tale:
that the other man (or whatev it is) crawl out everi night from the
big box in the corner which is kept lock all day you see
therefor how thi seal door of todhunt is treat as the gate
of all the fanci and monstros of the `thousand and one night
and yet there is the littl fellow in hi respect black jacket
as punctual and innoc as a parlour clock he pay hi rent to the tick;
he is practic a teetotaller; he is tirelessli kind with
the younger children and can keep them amus for a day on end; and
last and most urgent of all he ha made himself equal popular with
the eldest daughter who is readi to go to church with him tomorrow

a man warmli concern with ani larg theori ha alway
a relish for appli them to ani trivial the great specialist
have condescend to the priest simplic condescend expans
he settl himself with comfort in hi arm-chair and began to talk in
the tone of a somewhat absent-mind lecturer:

even in a minut instanc it is best to look first to
the main tendenc of natur a particular flower may not be dead
in earli winter but the flower are dying; a particular pebbl
may never be wet with the tide but the tide is come in
to the scientif eye all human histori is a seri of collect movement
destruct or migrat like the massacr of fli in winter
or the return of bird in spring now the root fact in all histori is race
race produc religion; race produc legal and ethic war
there is no stronger case than that of the wild unworldli and
perish stock which we commonli call the celt of whom your friend
the macnab are specimen small swarthi and of thi dreami and
drift blood they accept easili the superstiti explan of
ani incid just as they still accept (you will excus me for saying)
that superstiti explan of all incid which you
and your church repres it is not remark that such peopl
with the sea moan behind them and the church (excus me again)
drone in front of them should put fantast featur into what are
probabl plain event you with your small parochi respons
see onli thi particular mr macnab terrifi with thi particular tale
of two voic and a tall man out of the sea but the man with
the scientif imagin see as it were the whole clan of macnab
scatter over the whole world in it ultim averag as uniform
as a tribe of bird he see thousand of mr macnab
in thousand of hous drop their littl drop of morbid
in the tea-cup of their friends; he sees--

befor the scientist could conclud hi sentenc anoth and
more impati summon sound from without; someon with swish skirt
wa marshal hurriedli down the corridor and the door open on
a young girl decent dress but disord and red-hot with hast
she had sea-blown blond hair and would have been entir beauti
if her cheek-bon had not been in the scotch manner a littl
high in relief as well as in colour her apolog wa almost as abrupt
as a command

im sorri to interrupt you sir she said but i had to follow
father brown at once; it noth less than life or death

father brown began to get to hi feet in some disord
whi what ha happen maggie? he said

jame ha been murder for all i can make out
answer the girl still breath hard from her rush that man glass
ha been with him again; i heard them talk through the door quit plain
two separ voices: for jame speak low with a burr
and the other voic wa high and quaveri

that man glass? repeat the priest in some perplex

i know hi name is glass answer the girl in great impati
i heard it through the door they were quarrelling--about money
i think--for i heard jame say again and again `that right mr glass
or `no mr glass and then `two or three mr glass but were talk
too much; you must come at onc and there may be time yet

but time for what? ask dr hood who had been studi
the young ladi with mark interest what is there about mr glass
and hi money troubl that should impel such urgency?

i tri to break down the door and couldnt answer the girl shortli
then i ran to the back-yard and manag to climb on to the window-sil
that look into the room it wa an dim and seem to be empti
but i swear i saw jame lie huddl up in a corner as if he were
drug or strangl

thi is veri seriou said father brown gather hi errant hat
and umbrella and stand up; in point of fact i wa just put
your case befor thi gentleman and hi view--

ha been larg alter said the scientist grave
i do not think thi young ladi is so celtic as i had suppos
as i have noth els to do i will put on my hat and stroll
down town with you

in a few minut all three were approach the dreari tail of
the macnab street: the girl with the stern and breathless stride
of the mountain the criminologist with a loung grace (which wa
not without a certain leopard-lik swiftness) and the priest at an
energet trot entir devoid of distinct the aspect of thi
edg of the town wa not entir without justif for
the doctor hint about desol mood and environ
the scatter hous stood farther and farther apart in a broken string
along the seashore; the afternoon wa close with a prematur and
partli lurid twilight; the sea wa of an inki purpl and murmur omin
in the scrappi back garden of the macnab which ran down toward the sand
two black barren-look tree stood up like demon hand held up
in astonish and as mr macnab ran down the street to meet them
with lean hand similarli spread and her fierc face in shadow
she wa a littl like a demon herself the doctor and the priest
made scant repli to her shrill reiter of her daughter stori
with more disturb detail of her own to the divid vow of vengeanc
against mr glass for murder and against mr todhunt for be murder
or against the latter for have dare to want to marri her daughter
and for not have live to do it they pass through the narrow passag
in the front of the hous until they came to the lodger door at the back
and there dr hood with the trick of an old detect put hi shoulder
sharpli to the panel and burst in the door

it open on a scene of silent catastroph no one see it
even for a flash could doubt that the room had been the theatr
of some thrill collis between two or perhap more person
playing-card lay litter across the tabl or flutter about
the floor as if a game had been interrupt two wine glass stood
readi for wine on a side-t but a third lay smash
in a star of crystal upon the carpet a few feet from it lay
what look like a long knife or short sword straight
but with an ornament and pictur handl it dull blade just caught
a grey glint from the dreari window behind which show the black tree
against the leaden level of the sea toward the opposit corner
of the room wa roll a gentleman silk top hat as if it had
just been knock off hi head; so much so inde that one almost look
to see it still roll and in the corner behind it thrown like a sack
of potato but cord like a railway trunk lay mr jame todhunt
with a scarf across hi mouth and six or seven rope knot round
hi elbow and ankl hi brown eye were aliv and shift alertli

dr orion hood paus for one instant on the doormat and drank in
the whole scene of voiceless violenc then he step swiftli
across the carpet pick up the tall silk hat and grave put it
upon the head of the yet pinion todhunt it wa so much too larg
for him that it almost slip down on to hi shoulder

mr glasss hat said the doctor return with it and peer
into the insid with a pocket len how to explain the absenc
of mr glass and the presenc of mr glasss hat? for mr glass is not a
careless man with hi cloth that hat is of a stylish shape and
systemat brush and burnish though not veri new
an old dandi i should think

but good heavens! call out miss macnab arent you go to
unti the man first?

i say `old with intent though not with certainti
continu the expositor; my reason for it might seem a littl far-fetch
the hair of human be fall out in veri vari degre
but almost alway fall out slightli and with the len i should see
the tini hair in a hat recent worn it ha none which lead me
to guess that mr glass is bald now when thi is taken with
the high-pitch and querul voic which miss macnab describ
so vividli (patienc my dear ladi patience) when we take
the hairless head togeth with the tone common in senil anger
i should think we may deduc some advanc in year nevertheless
he wa probabl vigor and he wa almost certainli tall
i might reli in some degre on the stori of hi previou appear
at the window as a tall man in a silk hat but i think i have
more exact indic thi wineglass ha been smash all over the place
but one of it splinter lie on the high bracket besid the mantelpiec
no such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smash
in the hand of a compar short man like mr todhunt

by the way said father brown might it not be as well
to unti mr todhunter?

our lesson from the drinking-vessel doe not end here
proceed the specialist i may say at onc that it is possibl
that the man glass wa bald or nervou through dissip rather than age
mr todhunt as ha been remark is a quiet thrifti gentleman
essenti an abstain these card and wine-cup are no part
of hi normal habit; they have been produc for a particular companion
but as it happen we may go farther mr todhunt may or may not
possess thi wine-servic but there is no appear of hi
possess ani wine what then were these vessel to contain?
i would at onc suggest some brandi or whiski perhap of a luxuri sort
from a flask in the pocket of mr glass we have thu someth like
a pictur of the man or at least of the type: tall elderli fashion
but somewhat fray certainli fond of play and strong water
perhap rather too fond of them mr glass is a gentleman not unknown
on the fring of societi

look here cri the young woman if you dont let me pass to
unti him ill run outsid and scream for the polic

i should not advis you miss macnab said dr hood grave
to be in ani hurri to fetch the polic father brown
i serious ask you to compos your flock for their sake not for mine
well we have seen someth of the figur and qualiti of mr glass;
what are the chief fact known of mr todhunter? they are substanti three:
that he is econom that he is more or less wealthi and that
he ha a secret now sure it is obviou that there are
the three chief mark of the kind of man who is blackmail
and sure it is equal obviou that the fade fineri
the proflig habit and the shrill irrit of mr glass
are the unmistak mark of the kind of man who blackmail him
we have the two typic figur of a tragedi of hush money:
on the one hand the respect man with a mystery; on the other
the west-end vultur with a scent for a mysteri these two men
have met here today and have quarrel use blow and a bare weapon

are you go to take those rope off? ask the girl stubbornli

dr hood replac the silk hat care on the side tabl
and went across to the captiv he studi him intent
even move him a littl and half-turn him round by the shoulder
but he onli answered:

no; i think these rope will do veri well till your friend
the polic bring the handcuff

father brown who had been look dulli at the carpet
lift hi round face and said: what do you mean?

the man of scienc had pick up the peculiar dagger-sword
from the carpet and wa examin it intent as he answered:

becaus you find mr todhunt tie up he said you all jump
to the conclus that mr glass had tie him up; and then i suppos
escap there are four object to this: first whi should a gentleman
so dressi as our friend glass leav hi hat behind him if he left
of hi own free will? second he continu move toward the window
thi is the onli exit and it is lock on the insid third thi
blade here ha a tini touch of blood at the point but there is
no wound on mr todhunt mr glass took that wound away with him
dead or aliv add to all thi primari probabl
it is much more like that the blackmail person would tri to kill
hi incubu rather than that the blackmail would tri to kill
the goos that lay hi golden egg there i think we have
a pretti complet stori

but the ropes? inquir the priest whose eye had remain
open with a rather vacant admir

ah the rope said the expert with a singular inton
miss macnab veri much want to know whi i did not set mr todhunt
free from hi rope well i will tell her i did not do it becaus
mr todhunt can set himself free from them at ani minut he choos

what? cri the audienc on quit differ note of astonish

i have look at all the knot on mr todhunt reiter hood
quietli i happen to know someth about knots; they are quit
a branch of crimin scienc everi one of those knot he ha
made himself and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made
by an enemi realli tri to pinion him the whole of thi affair
of the rope is a clever fake to make us think him the victim of
the struggl instead of the wretch glass whose corps may be hidden
in the garden or stuf up the chimney

there wa a rather depress silence; the room wa darken
the sea-blight bough of the garden tree look leaner and
blacker than ever yet they seem to have come nearer to the window
one could almost fanci they were sea-monst like kraken or cuttlefish
writh polypi who had crawl up from the sea to see the end
of thi tragedi even as he the villain and victim of it
the terribl man in the tall hat had onc crawl up from the sea
for the whole air wa dens with the morbid of blackmail which is
the most morbid of human thing becaus it is a crime conceal a crime;
a black plaster on a blacker wound

the face of the littl cathol priest which wa commonli complac
and even comic had suddenli becom knot with a curiou frown
it wa not the blank curios of hi first innoc it wa rather
that creativ curios which come when a man ha the begin of
an idea say it again pleas he said in a simpl bother manner;
do you mean that todhunt can tie himself up all alon and
unti himself all alone?

that is what i mean said the doctor

jerusalem! ejacul brown suddenli i wonder if it could
possibl be that!

he scuttl across the room rather like a rabbit and peer with
quit a new impuls into the partially-cov face of the captiv
then he turn hi own rather fatuou face to the compani
ye that it! he cri in a certain excit cant you see it
in the man face? whi look at hi eyes!

both the professor and the girl follow the direct of hi glanc
and though the broad black scarf complet mask the lower half
of todhunt visag they did grow consciou of someth struggl
and intens about the upper part of it

hi eye do look queer cri the young woman strongli move
you brutes; i believ it hurt him!

not that i think said dr hood; the eye have certainli
a singular express but i should interpret those transvers
wrinkl as express rather such slight psycholog abnormality--

oh bosh! cri father brown: cant you see he laughing?

laughing! repeat the doctor with a start; but what on earth
can he be laugh at?

well repli the reverend brown apologet
not to put too fine a point on it i think he is laugh at you
and inde im a littl inclin to laugh at myself now i know about it

now you know about what? ask hood in some exasper

now i know repli the priest the profess of mr todhunt

he shuffl about the room look at one object after anoth
with what seem to be a vacant stare and then invari burst
into an equal vacant laugh a highli irrit process for those
who had to watch it he laugh veri much over the hat
still more uproari over the broken glass but the blood on
the sword point sent him into mortal convuls of amus
then he turn to the fume specialist

dr hood he cri enthusiast you are a great poet!
you have call an uncreat be out of the void how much more godlik
that is than if you had onli ferret out the mere facts!
inde the mere fact are rather commonplac and comic by comparison

i have no notion what you are talk about said dr hood
rather haughtily; my fact are all inevit though necessarili incomplet
a place may be permit to intuit perhap (or poetri if you
prefer the term) but onli becaus the correspond detail cannot
as yet be ascertain in the absenc of mr glass--

that it that it said the littl priest nod quit eagerli
that the first idea to get fixed; the absenc of mr glass
he is so extrem absent i suppos he ad reflect
that there wa never anybodi so absent as mr glass

do you mean he is absent from the town? demand the doctor

i mean he is absent from everywher answer father brown;
he is absent from the natur of thing so to speak

do you serious mean said the specialist with a smile
that there is no such person?

the priest made a sign of assent it doe seem a piti he said

orion hood broke into a contemptu laugh well he said
befor we go on to the hundr and one other evid let us take
the first proof we found; the first fact we fell over when we fell
into thi room if there is no mr glass whose hat is this?

it is mr todhunt repli father brown

but it doesnt fit him cri hood impati he couldnt
possibl wear it!

father brown shook hi head with ineff mild
i never said he could wear it he answer i said it wa hi hat
or if you insist on a shade of differ a hat that is hi

and what is the shade of difference? ask the criminologist
with a slight sneer

my good sir cri the mild littl man with hi first movement
akin to impati if you will walk down the street to the nearest
hatter shop you will see that there is in common speech
a differ between a man hat and the hat that are hi

but a hatter protest hood can get money out of hi
stock of new hat what could todhunt get out of thi one old hat?

rabbit repli father brown promptli

what? cri dr hood

rabbit ribbon sweetmeat goldfish roll of colour paper
said the reverend gentleman with rapid didnt you see it all
when you found out the fake ropes? it just the same with the sword
mr todhunt hasnt got a scratch on him as you say; but he got
a scratch in him if you follow me

do you mean insid mr todhunt clothes? inquir
mr macnab sternli

i do not mean insid mr todhunt cloth said father brown
i mean insid mr todhunt

well what in the name of bedlam do you mean?

mr todhunt explain father brown placidli is learn
to be a profession conjur as well as juggler ventriloquist
and expert in the rope trick the conjur explain the hat
it is without trace of hair not becaus it is worn by
the prematur bald mr glass but becaus it ha never been worn
by anybodi the juggl explain the three glass which todhunt
wa teach himself to throw up and catch in rotat
but be onli at the stage of practic he smash one glass
against the ceil and the juggl also explain the sword
which it wa mr todhunt profession pride and duti to swallow
but again be at the stage of practic he veri slightli graze
the insid of hi throat with the weapon henc he ha a wound
insid him which i am sure (from the express on hi face)
is not a seriou one he wa also practis the trick of
a releas from rope like the davenport brother and he wa just about
to free himself when we all burst into the room the card of cours
are for card trick and they are scatter on the floor becaus
he had just been practis one of those dodg of send them
fli through the air he mere kept hi trade secret
becaus he had to keep hi trick secret like ani other conjur
but the mere fact of an idler in a top hat have onc look in
at hi back window and been driven away by him with great indign
wa enough to set us all on a wrong track of romanc and make us imagin
hi whole life overshadow by the silk-hat spectr of mr glass

but what about the two voices? ask maggi stare

have you never heard a ventriloquist? ask father brown
dont you know they speak first in their natur voic and then
answer themselv in just that shrill squeaki unnatur voic
that you heard?

there wa a long silenc and dr hood regard the littl man
who had spoken with a dark and attent smile you are certainli
a veri ingeni person he said; it could not have been done better
in a book but there is just one part of mr glass you have not succeed
in explain away and that is hi name miss macnab distinctli
heard him so address by mr todhunt

the rev mr brown broke into a rather childish giggl
well that he said that the silliest part of the whole silli stori
when our juggl friend here threw up the three glass in turn
he count them aloud as he caught them and also comment aloud
when he fail to catch them what he realli said was: `one two
and three--miss a glass one two--miss a glass and so on

there wa a second of still in the room and then everyon
with one accord burst out laugh as they did so the figur
in the corner complac uncoil all the rope and let them fall
with a flourish then advanc into the middl of the room with a bow
he produc from hi pocket a big bill print in blue and red
which announc that zaladin the world greatest conjur
contortionist ventriloquist and human kangaroo would be readi
with an entir new seri of trick at the empir pavilion
scarborough on monday next at eight oclock precis



ii the paradis of thiev


the great muscari most origin of the young tuscan poet
walk swiftli into hi favourit restaur which overlook
the mediterranean wa cover by an awn and fenc by littl lemon
and orang tree waiter in white apron were alreadi lay out
on white tabl the insignia of an earli and eleg lunch;
and thi seem to increas a satisfact that alreadi touch
the top of swagger muscari had an eagl nose like dante;
hi hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing; he carri a black cloak
and might almost have carri a black mask so much did he bear with him
a sort of venetian melodrama he act as if a troubadour had still
a definit social offic like a bishop he went as near as
hi centuri permit to walk the world liter like don juan
with rapier and guitar

for he never travel without a case of sword with which
he had fought mani brilliant duel or without a correspond case
for hi mandolin with which he had actual serenad miss ethel harrog
the highli convent daughter of a yorkshir banker on a holiday
yet he wa neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot logic latin
who like a certain thing and wa it hi poetri wa as straightforward
as anyon els prose he desir fame or wine or the beauti of women
with a torrid direct inconceiv among the cloudi ideal
or cloudi compromis of the north; to vaguer race hi intens
smelt of danger or even crime like fire or the sea he wa too simpl
to be trust

the banker and hi beauti english daughter were stay
at the hotel attach to muscari restaurant; that wa whi it wa
hi favourit restaur a glanc flash around the room
told him at onc howev that the english parti had not descend
the restaur wa glitter but still compar empti
two priest were talk at a tabl in a corner but muscari
(an ardent catholic) took no more notic of them than of a coupl of crow
but from a yet farther seat partli conceal behind a dwarf tree
golden with orang there rose and advanc toward the poet a person
whose costum wa the most aggress opposit to hi own

thi figur wa clad in tweed of a piebald check with a pink tie
a sharp collar and protuber yellow boot he contriv
in the true tradit of arri at margat to look at onc startl
and commonplac but as the cockney apparit drew nearer
muscari wa astound to observ that the head wa distinctli
differ from the bodi it wa an italian head: fuzzi swarthi and
veri vivaci that rose abruptli out of the stand collar
like cardboard and the comic pink tie in fact it wa a head he knew
he recogn it abov all the dire erect of english holiday array
as the face of an old but forgotten friend name ezza thi youth
had been a prodigi at colleg and european fame wa promis him
when he wa bare fifteen; but when he appear in the world he fail
first publicli as a dramatist and a demagogu and then privat
for year on end as an actor a travel a commiss agent
or a journalist muscari had known him last behind the footlights;
he wa but too well attun to the excit of that profess
and it wa believ that some moral calam had swallow him up

ezza! cri the poet rise and shake hand in
a pleasant astonish well ive seen you in mani costum
in the green room; but i never expect to see you dress up
as an englishman

thi answer ezza grave is not the costum of an englishman
but of the italian of the futur

in that case remark muscari i confess i prefer
the italian of the past

that is your old mistak muscari said the man in tweed
shake hi head; and the mistak of itali in the sixteenth centuri
we tuscan made the morning: we had the newest steel the newest carv
the newest chemistri whi should we not now have the newest factori
the newest motor the newest finance--th newest clothes?

becaus they are not worth have answer muscari
you cannot make italian realli progressive; they are too intellig
men who see the short cut to good live will never go by
the new elabor road

well to me marconi or dannunzio is the star of itali
said the other that is whi i have becom a futurist--and a courier

a courier! cri muscari laugh is that the last of your
list of trades? and whom are you conducting?

oh a man of the name of harrog and hi famili i believ

not the banker in thi hotel? inquir the poet
with some eager

that the man answer the courier

doe it pay well? ask the troubadour innoc

it will pay me said ezza with a veri enigmat smile
but i am a rather curiou sort of courier then as if
chang the subject he said abruptly: he ha a daughter--and a son

the daughter is divin affirm muscari the father and son are
i suppos human but grant hi harmless qualiti doesnt that banker
strike you as a splendid instanc of my argument? harrog ha million
in hi safe and i have--th hole in my pocket but you darent say--
you cant say--that he clever than i or bolder than i or even
more energet he not clever he got eye like blue buttons;
he not energet he move from chair to chair like a paralyt
he a conscienti kindli old blockhead; but he got money simpli
becaus he collect money as a boy collect stamp
your too strong-mind for busi ezza you wont get on
to be clever enough to get all that money one must be stupid enough
to want it

im stupid enough for that said ezza gloomili but i should
suggest a suspens of your critiqu of the banker for here he come

mr harrog the great financi did inde enter the room
but nobodi look at him he wa a massiv elderli man with
a boil blue eye and fade grey-sandi moustaches; but for
hi heavi stoop he might have been a colonel he carri sever
unopen letter in hi hand hi son frank wa a realli fine lad
curly-hair sun-burnt and strenuous; but nobodi look at him either
all eye as usual were rivet for the moment at least
upon ethel harrog whose golden greek head and colour of the dawn
seem set purpos abov that sapphir sea like a goddesss
the poet muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drink someth
as inde he wa he wa drink the classic; which hi father made
ezza studi her with a gaze equal intens and far more baffl

miss harrog wa special radiant and readi for convers
on thi occasion; and her famili had fallen into the easier
continent habit allow the stranger muscari and even
the courier ezza to share their tabl and their talk in ethel harrog
convention crown itself with a perfect and splendour of it own
proud of her father prosper fond of fashion pleasur
a fond daughter but an arrant flirt she wa all these thing with
a sort of golden good-natur that made her veri pride pleas
and her worldli respect a fresh and hearti thing

they were in an eddi of excit about some alleg peril
in the mountain path they were to attempt that week the danger wa
not from rock and avalanch but from someth yet more romant
ethel had been earnestli assur that brigand the true cut-throat
of the modern legend still haunt that ridg and held that pass
of the apennin

they say she cri with the aw relish of a schoolgirl
that all that countri isnt rule by the king of itali but by
the king of thiev who is the king of thieves?

a great man repli muscari worthi to rank with
your own robin hood signorina montano the king of thiev
wa first heard of in the mountain some ten year ago when peopl
said brigand were extinct but hi wild author spread with
the swift of a silent revolut men found hi fierc proclam
nail in everi mountain village; hi sentinel gun in hand
in everi mountain ravin six time the italian govern
tri to dislodg him and wa defeat in six pitch battl
as if by napoleon

now that sort of thing observ the banker weightili
would never be allow in england; perhap after all we had better
choos anoth rout but the courier thought it perfectli safe

it is perfectli safe said the courier contemptu
i have been over it twenti time there may have been some old
jailbird call a king in the time of our grandmothers;
but he belong to histori if not to fabl brigandag is utterli
stamp out

it can never be utterli stamp out muscari answered;
becaus arm revolt is a recreat natur to southern
our peasant are like their mountain rich in grace and green gaieti
but with the fire beneath there is a point of human despair where
the northern poor take to drink--and our own poor take to dagger

a poet is privileg repli ezza with a sneer
if signor muscari were english be would still be look
for highwaymen in wandsworth believ me there is no more danger
of be captur in itali than of be scalp in boston

then you propos to attempt it? ask mr harrog frown

oh it sound rather dread cri the girl turn her
gloriou eye on muscari do you realli think the pass is dangerous?

muscari threw back hi black mane i know it is dangerous:
he said i am cross it tomorrow

the young harrog wa left behind for a moment empti a glass of
white wine and light a cigarett as the beauti retir with the banker
the courier and the poet distribut peal of silveri satir
at about the same instant the two priest in the corner rose;
the taller a white-hair italian take hi leav the shorter priest
turn and walk toward the banker son and the latter wa astonish
to realiz that though a roman priest the man wa an englishman
he vagu rememb meet him at the social crush of some of
hi cathol friend but the man spoke befor hi memori could
collect themselv

mr frank harrog i think he said i have had an introduct
but i do not mean to presum on it the odd thing i have to say
will come far better from a stranger mr harrog i say one word and go:
take care of your sister in her great sorrow

even for frank truli fratern indiffer the radianc
and deris of hi sister still seem to sparkl and ring;
he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel
and he stare at hi sombr advis in puzzledom

do you mean the brigands? he asked; and then rememb
a vagu fear of hi own or can you be think of muscari?

one is never think of the real sorrow said the strang priest
one can onli be kind when it come

and he pass promptli from the room leav the other almost
with hi mouth open

a day or two afterward a coach contain the compani wa
realli crawl and stagger up the spur of the menac mountain rang
between ezza cheeri denial of the danger and muscari boister
defianc of it the financi famili were firm in their origin purpose;
and muscari made hi mountain journey coincid with their
a more surpris featur wa the appear at the coast-town station
of the littl priest of the restaurant; he alleg mere
that busi led him also to cross the mountain of the midland
but young harrog could not but connect hi presenc with
the mystic fear and warn of yesterday

the coach wa a kind of commodi wagonett invent by
the modernist talent of the courier who domin the expedit
with hi scientif activ and breezi wit the theori of danger from
thiev wa banish from thought and speech; though so far conced
in formal act that some slight protect wa employ the courier
and the young banker carri load revolv and muscari
(with much boyish gratification) buckl on a kind of cutlass
under hi black cloak

he had plant hi person at a fli leap next to
the love englishwoman; on the other side of her sat the priest
whose name wa brown and who wa fortun a silent individual;
the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind
muscari wa in tower spirit serious believ in the peril
and hi talk to ethel might well have made her think him a maniac
but there wa someth in the crazi and gorgeou ascent
amid crag like peak load with wood like orchard that drag
her spirit up alon with hi into purpl preposter heaven
with wheel sun the white road climb like a white cat;
it span sunless chasm like a tight-rope; it wa flung round
far-off headland like a lasso

and yet howev high they went the desert still blossom
like the rose the field were burnish in sun and wind
with the colour of kingfish and parrot and humming-bird
the hue of a hundr flower flower there are no loveli meadow
and woodland than the english no nobler crest or chasm than
those of snowdon and glenco but ethel harrog had never befor
seen the southern park tilt on the splinter northern peaks;
the gorg of glenco laden with the fruit of kent there wa noth here
of that chill and desol that in britain one associ with
high and wild sceneri it wa rather like a mosaic palac
rent with earthquakes; or like a dutch tulip garden blown to the star
with dynamit

it like kew garden on beachi head said ethel

it is our secret answer he the secret of the volcano;
that is also the secret of the revolution--that a thing can be violent
and yet fruit

you are rather violent yourself and she smile at him

and yet rather fruitless he admitted; if i die tonight
i die unmarri and a fool

it is not my fault if you have come she said after
a difficult silenc

it is never your fault answer muscari; it wa not your fault
that troy fell

as they spoke they came under overwhelm cliff that spread
almost like wing abov a corner of peculiar peril shock by the
big shadow on the narrow ledg the hors stir doubt
the driver leapt to the earth to hold their head and they
becam ungovern one hors rear up to hi full height--
the titan and terrifi height of a hors when he becom a bipe
it wa just enough to alter the equilibrium; the whole coach
heel over like a ship and crash through the fring of bush
over the cliff muscari threw an arm round ethel who clung to him
and shout aloud it wa for such moment that he live

at the moment when the gorgeou mountain wall went round
the poet head like a purpl windmil a thing happen which wa
superfici even more startl the elderli and letharg banker
sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipic befor
the tilt vehicl could take him there in the first flash
it look as wild as suicide; but in the second it wa as sensibl as
a safe invest the yorkshireman had evid more promptitud
as well as more sagac than muscari had given him credit for;
for he land in a lap of land which might have been special pad
with turf and clover to receiv him as it happen inde
the whole compani were equal lucki if less dignifi in their
form of eject immedi under thi abrupt turn of the road
wa a grassi and floweri hollow like a sunken meadow; a sort of
green velvet pocket in the long green trail garment of the hill
into thi they were all tip or tumbl with littl damag
save that their smallest baggag and even the content of their pocket
were scatter in the grass around them the wreck coach still
hung abov entangl in the tough hedg and the hors plung
pain down the slope the first to sit up wa the littl priest
who scratch hi head with a face of foolish wonder frank harrog
heard him say to himself: now whi on earth have we fallen just here?

he blink at the litter around him and recov hi own
veri clumsi umbrella beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from
the head of muscari and besid it a seal busi letter which
after a glanc at the address he return to the elder harrog
on the other side of him the grass partli hid miss ethel sunshad
and just beyond it lay a curiou littl glass bottl hardli two inch long
the priest pick it up; in a quick unobtrus manner he uncork
and snif it and hi heavi face turn the colour of clay

heaven deliv us! he muttered; it cant be hers!
ha her sorrow come on her already? he slip it into hi own
waistcoat pocket i think im justifi he said till i know
a littl more

he gaze pain at the girl at that moment be rais out of
the flower by muscari who wa saying: we have fallen into heaven;
it is a sign mortal climb up and they fall down; but it is onli
god and goddess who can fall upward

and inde she rose out of the sea of colour so beauti and
happi a vision that the priest felt hi suspicion shaken and shift
after all he thought perhap the poison isnt hers; perhap it
one of muscari melodramat trick

muscari set the ladi lightli on her feet made her an absurdli
theatric bow and then draw hi cutlass hack hard at
the taut rein of the hors so that they scrambl to their feet
and stood in the grass trembl when he had done so
a most remark thing occur a veri quiet man veri poorli dress
and extrem sunburnt came out of the bush and took hold of
the hors head he had a queer-shap knife veri broad and crook
buckl on hi belt; there wa noth els remark about him
except hi sudden and silent appear the poet ask him who he wa
and he did not answer

look around him at the confus and startl group in the hollow
muscari then perceiv that anoth tan and tatter man
with a short gun under hi arm wa look at them from
the ledg just below lean hi elbow on the edg of the turf
then he look up at the road from which they had fallen and saw
look down on them the muzzl of four other carbin and
four other brown face with bright but quit motionless eye

the brigands! cri muscari with a kind of monstrou gaieti
thi wa a trap ezza if you will oblig me by shoot the
coachman first we can cut our way out yet there are onli six of them

the coachman said ezza who wa stand grimli with hi hand
in hi pocket happen to be a servant of mr harrog

then shoot him all the more cri the poet impatiently;
he wa bribe to upset hi master then put the ladi in the middl
and we will break the line up there--with a rush

and wade in wild grass and flower he advanc fearlessli
on the four carbines; but find that no one follow except
young harrog he turn brandish hi cutlass to wave the other on
he beheld the courier still stand slightli astrid in the centr of
the grassi ring hi hand in hi pockets; and hi lean iron
italian face seem to grow longer and longer in the even light

you thought muscari i wa the failur among our schoolfellow
he said and you thought you were the success but i have succeed
more than you and fill a bigger place in histori i have been
act epic while you have been write them

come on i tell you! thunder muscari from abov
will you stand there talk nonsens about yourself with a woman
to save and three strong men to help you? what do you call yourself?

i call myself montano cri the strang courier in a voic
equal loud and full i am the king of thiev and i welcom you all
to my summer palac

and even as he spoke five more silent men with weapon readi
came out of the bush and look toward him for their order
one of them held a larg paper in hi hand

thi pretti littl nest where we are all picnick
went on the courier-brigand with the same easi yet sinist smile
is togeth with some cave underneath it known by the name of
the paradis of thiev it is my princip stronghold on these hills;
for (a you have doubtless noticed) the eyri is invis both from
the road abov and from the valley below it is someth better
than impregnable; it is unnotic here i mostli live and here
i shall certainli die if the gendarm ever track me here
i am not the kind of crimin that `reserv hi defenc
but the better kind that reserv hi last bullet

all were stare at him thunderstruck and still except father brown
who heav a huge sigh as of relief and finger the littl phial
in hi pocket thank god! he muttered; that much more probabl
the poison belong to thi robber-chief of cours he carri it
so that he may never be captur like cato

the king of thiev wa howev continu hi address with
the same kind of danger polit it onli remain for me
he said to explain to my guest the social condit upon which
i have the pleasur of entertain them i need not expound
the quaint old ritual of ransom which it is incumb upon me
to keep up; and even thi onli appli to a part of the compani
the reverend father brown and the celebr signor muscari
i shall releas tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outpost
poet and priest if you will pardon my simplic of speech
never have ani money and so (sinc it is imposs to get anyth
out of them) let us seiz the opportun to show our admir for
classic literatur and our rever for holi church

he paus with an unpleas smile; and father brown
blink repeatedli at him and seem suddenli to be listen
with great attent the brigand captain took the larg paper from
the attend brigand and glanc over it continued:
my other intent are clearli set forth in thi public document
which i will hand round in a moment; and which after that will be
post on a tree by everi villag in the valley and everi cross-road
in the hill i will not weari you with the verbal sinc you
will be abl to check it; the substanc of my proclam is this:
i announc first that i have captur the english millionair
the colossu of financ mr samuel harrog i next announc
that i have found on hi person note and bond for two thousand pound
which he ha given up to me now sinc it would be realli immor
to announc such a thing to a credul public if it had not occur
i suggest it should occur without further delay i suggest that
mr harrog senior should now give me the two thousand pound
in hi pocket

the banker look at him under lower brow red-fac and sulki
but seemingli cow that leap from the fail carriag seem
to have use up hi last viril he had held back in a hang-dog style
when hi son and muscari had made a bold movement to break out of
the brigand trap and now hi red and trembl hand went reluctantli
to hi breast-pocket and pass a bundl of paper and envelop
to the brigand

excellent! cri that outlaw gaily; so far we are all cosi
i resum the point of my proclam so soon to be publish
to all itali the third item is that of ransom i am ask
from the friend of the harrog famili a ransom of three thousand pound
which i am sure is almost insult to that famili in it moder estim
of their import who would not pay tripl thi sum for anoth day
associ with such a domest circle? i will not conceal from you
that the document end with certain legal phrase about
the unpleas thing that may happen if the money is not paid;
but meanwhil ladi and gentlemen let me assur you that
i am comfort off here for accommod wine and cigar
and bid you for the present a sportsman-lik welcom to the luxuri
of the paradis of thiev

all the time that he had been speak the dubious-look men
with carbin and dirti slouch hat had been gather silent
in such preponder number that even muscari wa compel
to recogn hi salli with the sword as hopeless he glanc around him;
but the girl had alreadi gone over to sooth and comfort her father
for her natur affect for hi person wa as strong or stronger than
her somewhat snobbish pride in hi success muscari with the illog
of a lover admir thi filial devot and yet wa irrit by it
he slap hi sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself
somewhat sulkili on one of the green bank the priest sat down
within a yard or two and muscari turn hi aquilin nose on him
in an instantan irrit

well said the poet tartli do peopl still think me too romantic?
are there i wonder ani brigand left in the mountains?

there may be said father brown agnost

what do you mean? ask the other sharpli

i mean i am puzzl repli the priest i am puzzl about
ezza or montano or whatev hi name is he seem to me much more
inexplic as a brigand even than he wa as a courier

but in what way? persist hi companion santa maria!
i should have thought the brigand wa plain enough

i find three curiou difficulti said the priest in a quiet voic
i should like to have your opinion on them first of all
i must tell you i wa lunch in that restaur at the seasid
as four of you left the room you and miss harrog went ahead
talk and laughing; the banker and the courier came behind
speak spare and rather low but i could not help hear ezza
say these words--`wel let her have a littl fun; you know the blow
may smash her ani minut mr harrog answer nothing;
so the word must have had some mean on the impuls of the moment
i warn her brother that she might be in peril; i said noth
of it natur for i did not know but if it meant thi captur
in the hill the thing is nonsens whi should the brigand-couri
warn hi patron even by a hint when it wa hi whole purpos to lure him
into the mountain-mousetrap? it could not have meant that
but if not what is thi disast known both to courier and banker
which hang over miss harrog head?

disast to miss harrogate! ejacul the poet sit up
with some feroc explain yourself; go on

all my riddl howev revolv round our bandit chief
resum the priest reflect and here is the second of them
whi did he put so promin in hi demand for ransom the fact that
he had taken two thousand pound from hi victim on the spot?
it had no faintest tendenc to evok the ransom quit the other way
in fact harrog friend would be far likeli to fear for hi fate
if they thought the thiev were poor and desper yet the spoliat
on the spot wa emphas and even put first in the demand
whi should ezza montano want so special to tell all europ that
he had pick the pocket befor he levi the blackmail?

i cannot imagin said muscari rub up hi black hair
for onc with an unaffect gestur you may think you enlighten me
but you are lead me deeper in the dark what may be the third
object to the king of the thieves? the third object
said father brown still in medit is thi bank we are sit on
whi doe our brigand-couri call thi hi chief fortress and
the paradis of thieves? it is certainli a soft spot to fall on
and a sweet spot to look at it is also quit true as he say
that it is invis from valley and peak and is therefor a hiding-plac
but it is not a fortress it never could be a fortress
i think it would be the worst fortress in the world for it is actual
command from abov by the common high-road across the mountains--
the veri place where the polic would most probabl pass
whi five shabbi short gun held us helpless here about half an hour ago
the quarter of a compani of ani kind of soldier could have blown us
over the precipic whatev is the mean of thi odd littl nook
of grass and flower it is not an entrench posit
it is someth else; it ha some other strang sort of importance;
some valu that i do not understand it is more like an accident theatr
or a natur green-room; it is like the scene for some romant comedy;
it is like

as the littl priest word lengthen and lost themselv
in a dull and dreami sincer muscari whose anim sens were alert
and impati heard a new nois in the mountain even for him
the sound wa as yet veri small and faint; but he could have sworn
the even breez bore with it someth like the pulsat of
hors hoof and a distant halloo

at the same moment and long befor the vibrat had touch
the less-experienc english ear montano the brigand ran up
the bank abov them and stood in the broken hedg steadi himself
against a tree and peer down the road he wa a strang figur
as he stood there for he had assum a flap fantast hat and
swing baldric and cutlass in hi capac of bandit king
but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier show through in patch
all over him

the next moment he turn hi oliv sneer face and made
a movement with hi hand the brigand scatter at the signal
not in confus but in what wa evid a kind of guerrilla disciplin
instead of occupi the road along the ridg they sprinkl themselv
along the side of it behind the tree and the hedg as if watch unseen
for an enemi the nois beyond grew stronger begin to shake
the mountain road and a voic could be clearli heard call out order
the brigand sway and huddl curs and whisper
and the even air wa full of littl metal nois as they
cock their pistol or loosen their knive or trail their scabbard
over the stone then the nois from both quarter seem to meet
on the road above; branch broke hors neigh men cri out

a rescue! cri muscari spring to hi feet and wave hi hat;
the gendarm are on them! now for freedom and a blow for it!
now to be rebel against robbers! come dont let us leav everyth
to the police; that is so dread modern fall on the rear
of these ruffian the gendarm are rescu us; come friend
let us rescu the gendarmes!

and throw hi hat over the tree he drew hi cutlass onc more
and began to escalad the slope up to the road frank harrog
jump up and ran across to help him revolv in hand but wa astound
to hear himself imper recal by the raucou voic of hi father
who seem to be in great agit

i wont have it said the banker in a choke voice;
i command you not to interfer

but father said frank veri warmli an italian gentleman ha
led the way you wouldnt have it said that the english hung back

it is useless said the older man who wa trembl violent
it is useless we must submit to our lot

father brown look at the banker; then he put hi hand instinct
as if on hi heart but realli on the littl bottl of poison;
and a great light came into hi face like the light of the revel
of death

muscari meanwhil without wait for support had crest the bank
up to the road and struck the brigand king heavili on the shoulder
caus him to stagger and swing round montano also had
hi cutlass unsheath and muscari without further speech
sent a slash at hi head which he wa compel to catch and parri
but even as the two short blade cross and clash the king of thiev
deliber drop hi point and laugh

what the good old man? he said in spirit italian slang;
thi damn farc will soon be over

what do you mean you shuffler? pant the fire- poet
is your courag a sham as well as your honesty?

everyth about me is a sham respond the ex-couri
in complet good humour i am an actor; and if i ever had
a privat charact i have forgotten it i am no more a genuin brigand
than i am a genuin courier i am onli a bundl of mask
and you cant fight a duel with that and he laugh with boyish pleasur
and fell into hi old straddl attitud with hi back to the skirmish
up the road

dark wa deepen under the mountain wall and it wa not easi
to discern much of the progress of the struggl save that tall men
were push their hors muzzl through a cling crowd of brigand
who seem more inclin to harass and hustl the invad
than to kill them it wa more like a town crowd prevent
the passag of the polic than anyth the poet had ever pictur
as the last stand of doom and outlaw men of blood just as he wa
roll hi eye in bewilder he felt a touch on hi elbow
and found the odd littl priest stand there like a small noah
with a larg hat and request the favour of a word or two

signor muscari said the cleric in thi queer crisi
person may be pardon i may tell you without offenc
of a way in which you will do more good than by help the gendarm
who are bound to break through in ani case you will permit me
the impertin intimaci but do you care about that girl?
care enough to marri her and make her a good husband i mean?

ye said the poet quit simpli

doe she care about you?

i think so wa the equal grave repli

then go over there and offer yourself said the priest:
offer her everyth you can; offer her heaven and earth
if youv got them the time is short

why? ask the astonish man of letter

becaus said father brown her doom is come up the road

noth is come up the road argu muscari except the rescu

well you go over there said hi advis and be readi
to rescu her from the rescu

almost as he spoke the hedg were broken all along the ridg
by a rush of the escap brigand they dive into bush
and thick grass like defeat men pursued; and the great cock hat
of the mount gendarmeri were seen pass along abov the broken hedg
anoth order wa given; there wa a nois of dismount
and a tall offic with cock hat a grey imperi and a paper in hi hand
appear in the gap that wa the gate of the paradis of thiev
there wa a momentari silenc broken in an extraordinari way by the banker
who cri out in a hoars and strangl voice: robbed! ive been robbed!

whi that wa hour ago cri hi son in astonishment:
when you were rob of two thousand pound

not of two thousand pound said the financi with an abrupt
and terribl composur onli of a small bottl

the policeman with the grey imperi wa stride across
the green hollow encount the king of the thiev in hi path
he clap him on the shoulder with someth between a caress
and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him stagger away
youll get into troubl too he said if you play these trick

again to muscari artist eye it seem scarc like
the captur of a great outlaw at bay pass on the policeman halt
befor the harrog group and said: samuel harrog i arrest you
in the name of the law for embezzl of the fund of the hull and
huddersfield bank

the great banker nod with an odd air of busi assent
seem to reflect a moment and befor they could interpos took
a half turn and a step that brought him to the edg of the outer
mountain wall then fling up hi hand he leapt exactli as he leapt
out of the coach but thi time he did not fall into a littl meadow
just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below to becom a wreck of bone
in the valley

the anger of the italian policeman which he express volubl
to father brown wa larg mix with admir it wa like him
to escap us at last he said he wa a great brigand if you like
thi last trick of hi i believ to be absolut unpreced
he fled with the compani money to itali and actual got himself
captur by sham brigand in hi own pay so as to explain both the
disappear of the money and the disappear of himself
that demand for ransom wa realli taken serious by most of the polic
but for year he been do thing as good as that quit as good
as that he will be a seriou loss to hi famili

iii the duel of dr hirsch


m mauric brun and m armand armagnac were cross the sunlit
champ elyse with a kind of vivaci respect
they were both short brisk and bold they both had black beard
that did not seem to belong to their face after the strang french fashion
which make real hair look like artifici m brun had
a dark wedg of beard appar affix under hi lower lip
m armagnac by way of a chang had two beards; one stick out
from each corner of hi emphat chin they were both young
they were both atheist with a depress fixiti of outlook
but great mobil of exposit they were both pupil of
the great dr hirsch scientist publicist and moralist

m brun had becom promin by hi propos that the common
express adieu should be obliter from all the french classic
and a slight fine impos for it use in privat life then he said
the veri name of your imagin god will have echo for the last time
in the ear of man m armagnac special rather in a resist
to militar and wish the choru of the marseillais alter from
aux arm citoyen to aux greve citoyen but hi antimilitar
wa of a peculiar and gallic sort an emin and veri wealthi
english quaker who had come to see him to arrang for the disarma
of the whole planet wa rather distress by armagnac propos
that (bi way of beginning) the soldier should shoot their offic

and inde it wa in thi regard that the two men differ most
from their leader and father in philosophi dr hirsch
though born in franc and cover with the most triumphant favour
of french educ wa temperament of anoth type--mild dreami
humane; and despit hi sceptic system not devoid of transcendent
he wa in short more like a german than a frenchman; and much as they
admir him someth in the subconsci of these gaul wa
irrit at hi plead for peac in so peac a manner
to their parti throughout europ howev paul hirsch wa
a saint of scienc hi larg and dare cosmic theori
advertis hi auster life and innoc if somewhat frigid morality;
he held someth of the posit of darwin doubl with the posit
of tolstoy but he wa neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot;
hi view on disarma were moder and evolutionary--
the republican govern put consider confid in him
as to variou chemic improv he had late even discov
a noiseless explos the secret of which the govern wa
care guard

hi hous stood in a handsom street near the elysee--
a street which in that strong summer seem almost as full of foliag
as the park itself; a row of chestnut shatter the sunshin
interrupt onli in one place where a larg cafe ran out into the street
almost opposit to thi were the white and green blind of
the great scientist hous an iron balconi also paint green
run along in front of the first-floor window beneath thi wa
the entranc into a kind of court gay with shrub and tile
into which the two frenchmen pass in anim talk

the door wa open to them by the doctor old servant simon
who might veri well have pass for a doctor himself have a strict
suit of black spectacl grey hair and a confidenti manner
in fact he wa a far more present man of scienc than hi master
dr hirsch who wa a fork radish of a fellow with just enough
bulb of a head to make hi bodi insignific with all the graviti
of a great physician handl a prescript simon hand a letter
to m armagnac that gentleman rip it up with a racial impati
and rapidli read the following:

i cannot come down to speak to you there is a man in thi hous
whom i refus to meet he is a chauvinist offic dubosc
he is sit on the stair he ha been kick the furnitur about
in all the other rooms; i have lock myself in my studi
opposit that cafe if you love me go over to the cafe and wait
at one of the tabl outsid i will tri to send him over to you
i want you to answer him and deal with him i cannot meet him myself
i cannot: i will not

there is go to be anoth dreyfu case

p hirsch



m armagnac look at m brun m brun borrow the letter
read it and look at m armagnac then both betook themselv briskli
to one of the littl tabl under the chestnut opposit
where they procur two tall glass of horribl green absinth
which they could drink appar in ani weather and at ani time
otherwis the cafe seem empti except for one soldier drink coffe
at one tabl and at anoth a larg man drink a small syrup and
a priest drink noth

mauric brun clear hi throat and said: of cours we must help
the master in everi way but--

there wa an abrupt silenc and armagnac said: he may have
excel reason for not meet the man himself but--

befor either could complet a sentenc it wa evid that
the invad had been expel from the hous opposit the shrub under
the archway sway and burst apart as that unwelcom guest wa
shot out of them like a cannon-bal

he wa a sturdi figur in a small and tilt tyrolean felt hat
a figur that had inde someth gener tyrolean about it
the man shoulder were big and broad but hi leg were neat and activ
in knee-breech and knit stock hi face wa brown like a nut;
he had veri bright and restless brown eyes; hi dark hair wa brush back
stiffli in front and crop close behind outlin a squar and
power skull; and he had a huge black moustach like the horn of a bison
such a substanti head is gener base on a bull neck; but thi wa
hidden by a big colour scarf swath round up the man ear
and fall in front insid hi jacket like a sort of fanci waistcoat
it wa a scarf of strong dead colour dark red and old gold and purpl
probabl of orient fabric altogeth the man had someth
a shade barbar about him; more like a hungarian squir than
an ordinari french offic hi french howev wa obvious
that of a native; and hi french patriot wa so impuls
as to be slightli absurd hi first act when he burst out of the archway
wa to call in a clarion voic down the street: are there ani
frenchmen here? as if he were call for christian in mecca

armagnac and brun instantli stood up; but they were too late
men were alreadi run from the street corners; there wa a small
but ever-clust crowd with the prompt french instinct for
the polit of the street the man with the black moustach had alreadi
run across to a corner of the cafe sprung on one of the tabl
and seiz a branch of chestnut to steadi himself shout
as camil desmoulin onc shout when he scatter the oak-leav
among the populac

frenchmen! he volleyed; i cannot speak! god help me that is whi
i am speaking! the fellow in their filthi parliament who learn
to speak also learn to be silent--sil as that spi cower
in the hous opposite! silent as he is when i beat on hi bedroom door!
silent as he is now though he hear my voic across thi street
and shake where he sits! oh they can be silent eloquently--
the politicians! but the time ha come when we that cannot speak
must speak you are betray to the prussian betray at thi moment
betray by that man i am jule dubosc colonel of artilleri belfort
we caught a german spi in the vosg yesterday and a paper wa found
on him--a paper i hold in my hand oh they tri to hush it up;
but i took it direct to the man who wrote it--th man in that house!
it is in hi hand it is sign with hi initi it is a direct
for find the secret of thi new noiseless powder hirsch invent it;
hirsch wrote thi note about it thi note is in german and wa found
in a german pocket `tell the man the formula for powder is in
grey envelop in first drawer to the left of secretari desk
war offic in red ink he must be care ph

he rattl short sentenc like a quick-fir gun but he wa plainli
the sort of man who is either mad or right the mass of the crowd
wa nationalist and alreadi in threaten uproar; and a minor
of equal angri intellectu led by armagnac and brun onli made
the major more milit

if thi is a militari secret shout brun whi do you yell
about it in the street?

i will tell you whi i do! roar dubosc abov the roar crowd
i went to thi man in straight and civil style if he had ani explan
it could have been given in complet confid he refus to explain
he refer me to two stranger in a cafe as to two flunkey
he ha thrown me out of the hous but i am go back into it
with the peopl of pari behind me!

a shout seem to shake the veri facad of mansion and
two stone flew one break a window abov the balconi
the indign colonel plung onc more under the archway and wa heard
cri and thunder insid everi instant the human sea grew wider
and wider; it surg up against the rail and step of the traitor house;
it wa alreadi certain that the place would be burst into like
the bastil when the broken french window open and dr hirsch came out
on the balconi for an instant the furi half turn to laughter;
for he wa an absurd figur in such a scene hi long bare neck and
slope shoulder were the shape of a champagn bottl but that wa
the onli festiv thing about him hi coat hung on him as on a peg;
he wore hi carrot-colour hair long and weedy; hi cheek and chin
were fulli fring with one of those irrit beard that begin
far from the mouth he wa veri pale and he wore blue spectacl

livid as he wa he spoke with a sort of prim decis
so that the mob fell silent in the middl of hi third sentenc

onli two thing to say to you now the first is to my foe
the second to my friend to my foe i say: it is true i will not
meet m dubosc though he is storm outsid thi veri room
it is true i have ask two other men to confront him for me
and i will tell you why! becaus i will not and must not see him--
becaus it would be against all rule of digniti and honour to see him
befor i am triumphantli clear befor a court there is
anoth arbitr thi gentleman owe me as a gentleman
and in refer him to my second i am strictly--

armagnac and brun were wave their hat wildli and even
the doctor enemi roar applaus at thi unexpect defianc
onc more a few sentenc were inaud but they could hear him say:
to my friends--i myself should alway prefer weapon pure intellectu
and to these an evolv human will certainli confin itself
but our own most preciou truth is the fundament forc of matter
and hered my book are successful; my theori are unrefuted;
but i suffer in polit from a prejudic almost physic in the french
i cannot speak like clemenceau and derouled for their word are like
echo of their pistol the french ask for a duellist as the english
ask for a sportsman well i give my proofs: i will pay
thi barbar bribe and then go back to reason for the rest of my life

two men were instantli found in the crowd itself to offer
their servic to colonel dubosc who came out present satisfi
one wa the common soldier with the coffe who said simply:
i will act for you sir i am the duc de valogn the other wa
the big man whom hi friend the priest sought at first to dissuade;
and then walk away alon

in the earli even a light dinner wa spread at the back of
the cafe charlemagn though unroof by ani glass or gilt plaster
the guest were nearli all under a delic and irregular roof of leaves;
for the ornament tree stood so thick around and among the tabl
as to give someth of the dim and the dazzl of a small orchard
at one of the central tabl a veri stumpi littl priest sat
in complet solitud and appli himself to a pile of whitebait
with the gravest sort of enjoy hi daili live be veri plain
he had a peculiar tast for sudden and isol luxuries; he wa
an abstemi epicur he did not lift hi eye from hi plate
round which red pepper lemon brown bread and butter etc
were rigidli rank until a tall shadow fell across the tabl
and hi friend flambeau sat down opposit flambeau wa gloomi

im afraid i must chuck thi busi said he heavili
im all on the side of the french soldier like dubosc
and im all against the french atheist like hirsch; but it seem to me
in thi case weve made a mistak the duke and i thought it as well
to investig the charg and i must say im glad we did

is the paper a forgeri then? ask the priest

that just the odd thing repli flambeau it exactli like
hirsch write and nobodi can point out ani mistak in it
but it wasnt written by hirsch if he a french patriot
he didnt write it becaus it give inform to germani
and if he a german spi he didnt write it well--becaus it doesnt
give inform to germani

you mean the inform is wrong? ask father brown

wrong repli the other and wrong exactli where dr hirsch
would have been right--about the hiding-plac of hi own secret formula
in hi own offici depart by favour of hirsch and the author
the duke and i have actual been allow to inspect the secret drawer
at the war offic where the hirsch formula is kept we are the onli peopl
who have ever known it except the inventor himself and the minist
for war; but the minist permit it to save hirsch from fight
after that we realli cant support dubosc if hi revel
is a mare nest

and it is? ask father brown

it is said hi friend gloomili it is a clumsi forgeri
by somebodi who knew noth of the real hiding-plac it say the paper
is in the cupboard on the right of the secretari desk as a fact
the cupboard with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk
it say the grey envelop contain a long document written in red ink
it isnt written in red ink but in ordinari black ink
it manifestli absurd to say that hirsch can have made a mistak
about a paper that nobodi knew of but himself; or can have tri
to help a foreign thief by tell him to fumbl in the wrong drawer
i think we must chuck it up and apolog to old carrot

father brown seem to cogitate; he lift a littl whitebait
on hi fork you are sure the grey envelop wa in the left cupboard?
he ask

posit repli flambeau the grey envelope--
it wa a white envelop really--was--

father brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and
stare across at hi companion what? he ask in an alter voic

well what? repeat flambeau eat heartili

it wa not grey said the priest flambeau you frighten me

what the deuc are you frighten of?

im frighten of a white envelop said the other serious
if it had onli just been grey! hang it all it might as well
have been grey but if it wa white the whole busi is black
the doctor ha been dabbl in some of the old brimston after all

but i tell you he couldnt have written such a note!
cri flambeau the note is utterli wrong about the fact
and innoc or guilti dr hirsch knew all about the fact

the man who wrote that note knew all about the fact
said hi cleric companion soberli he could never have
got em so wrong without know about em you have to know
an aw lot to be wrong on everi subject--lik the devil

do you mean--?

i mean a man tell lie on chanc would have told some of the truth
said hi friend firmli suppos someon sent you to find a hous
with a green door and a blue blind with a front garden but no back garden
with a dog but no cat and where they drank coffe but not tea
you would say if you found no such hous that it wa all made up
but i say no i say if you found a hous where the door wa blue and
the blind green where there wa a back garden and no front garden
where cat were common and dog instantli shot where tea wa drunk
in quart and coffe forbidden--then you would know you had
found the hous the man must have known that particular hous
to be so accur inaccur

but what could it mean? demand the diner opposit

i cant conceiv said brown; i dont understand thi hirsch
affair at all as long as it wa onli the left drawer instead of
the right and red ink instead of black i thought it must be the
chanc blunder of a forger as you say but three is a mystic number;
it finish thing it finish thi that the direct about
the drawer the colour of ink the colour of envelop should none of
them be right by accid that cant be a coincid it wasnt

what wa it then? treason? ask flambeau resum hi dinner

i dont know that either answer brown with a face
of blank bewilder the onli thing i can think of
well i never understood that dreyfu case i can alway grasp
moral evid easier than the other sort i go by a man eye and voic
dont you know and whether hi famili seem happi and by what
subject he chooses--and avoid well i wa puzzl in the dreyfu case
not by the horribl thing imput both ways; i know (though it not
modern to say so) that human natur in the highest place is still capabl
of be cenci or borgia no-- what puzzl me wa the sincer
of both parti i dont mean the polit parties; the rank and file
are alway roughli honest and often dupe i mean the person
of the play i mean the conspir if they were conspir
i mean the traitor if he wa a traitor i mean the men who must have
known the truth now dreyfu went on like a man who knew he wa
a wrong man and yet the french statesmen and soldier went on
as if they knew he wasnt a wrong man but simpli a wrong un
i dont mean they behav well; i mean they behav as if they were sure
i cant describ these things; i know what i mean

i wish i did said hi friend and what ha it to do
with old hirsch?

suppos a person in a posit of trust went on the priest
began to give the enemi inform becaus it wa fals inform
suppos he even thought he wa save hi countri by mislead the foreign
suppos thi brought him into spi circl and littl loan were made to him
and littl tie tie on to him suppos he kept up hi contradictori
posit in a confus way by never tell the foreign spi the truth
but let it more and more be guess the better part of him
(what wa left of it) would still say: `i have not help the enemy;
i said it wa the left drawer the meaner part of him would alreadi
be saying: `but they may have the sens to see that mean the right
i think it is psycholog possible--in an enlighten age you know

it may be psycholog possibl answer flambeau
and it certainli would explain dreyfu be certain he wa wrong
and hi judg be sure he wa guilti but it wont wash histor
becaus dreyfuss document (if it wa hi document) wa liter correct

i wasnt think of dreyfu said father brown

silenc had sunk around them with the empti of the tables;
it wa alreadi late though the sunlight still clung to everyth
as if accident entangl in the tree in the still flambeau
shift hi seat sharply--mak an isol and echo noise--
and threw hi elbow over the angl of it well he said rather harshli
if hirsch is not better than a timid treason-mong

you mustnt be too hard on them said father brown gentli
it not entir their fault; but they have no instinct
i mean those thing that make a woman refus to danc with a man
or a man to touch an invest theyv been taught that
it all a matter of degre

anyhow cri flambeau impati he not a patch
on my principal; and i shall go through with it old dubosc may be
a bit mad but he a sort of patriot after all

father brown continu to consum whitebait

someth in the stolid way he did so caus flambeau
fierc black eye to rambl over hi companion afresh what the matter
with you? flambeau demand dubosc all right in that way
you dont doubt him?

my friend said the small priest lay down hi knife and fork
in a kind of cold despair i doubt everyth everyth i mean
that ha happen today i doubt the whole stori though it ha been
act befor my face i doubt everi sight that my eye have seen
sinc morn there is someth in thi busi quit differ
from the ordinari polic mysteri where one man is more or less lie
and the other man more or less tell the truth here both men
well! ive told you the onli theori i can think of that could
satisfi anybodi it doesnt satisfi me

nor me either repli flambeau frown while the other
went on eat fish with an air of entir resign if all you
can suggest is that notion of a messag convey by contrari
i call it uncommonli clever butwel what would you call it?

i should call it thin said the priest promptli
i should call it uncommonli thin but that the queer thing
about the whole busi the lie is like a schoolboy
there are onli three version dubosc and hirsch and that fanci of mine
either that note wa written by a french offic to ruin a french official;
or it wa written by the french offici to help german officers;
or it wa written by the french offici to mislead german offic
veri well youd expect a secret paper pass between such peopl
offici or offic to look quit differ from that
youd expect probabl a cipher certainli abbreviations;
most certainli scientif and strictli profession term
but thi thing elabor simpl like a penni dreadful:
`in the purpl grotto you will find the golden casket it look as if
as if it were meant to be seen through at onc

almost befor they could take it in a short figur in french uniform
had walk up to their tabl like the wind and sat down
with a sort of thump

i have extraordinari news said the duc de valogn
i have just come from thi colonel of our he is pack up
to leav the countri and he ask us to make hi excus sur le terrain

what? cri flambeau with an incredul quit frightful--
apologize?

ye said the duke gruffly; then and there--befor everybody--
when the sword are drawn and you and i have to do it while
he is leav the countri

but what can thi mean? cri flambeau he cant be afraid of
that littl hirsch! confound it! he cri in a kind of ration rage;
nobodi could be afraid of hirsch!

i believ it some plot! snap valognes--som plot of
the jew and freemason it meant to work up glori for hirsch

the face of father brown wa commonplac but curious contented;
it could shine with ignor as well as with knowledg
but there wa alway one flash when the foolish mask fell
and the wise mask fit itself in it place; and flambeau
who knew hi friend knew that hi friend had suddenli understood
brown said noth but finish hi plate of fish

where did you last see our preciou colonel? ask flambeau
irrit

he round at the hotel saint loui by the elyse
where we drove with him he pack up i tell you

will he be there still do you think? ask flambeau
frown at the tabl

i dont think he can get away yet repli the duke;
he pack to go a long journey

no said father brown quit simpli but suddenli stand up
for a veri short journey for one of the shortest in fact
but we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor-cab

noth more could be got out of him until the cab swept
round the corner by the hotel saint loui where they got out
and he led the parti up a side lane alreadi in deep shadow with
the grow dusk onc when the duke impati ask whether
hirsch wa guilti of treason or not he answer rather absently:
no; onli of ambition--lik caesar then he somewhat inconsequ added:
he live a veri lone life; he ha had to do everyth for himself

well if he ambiti he ought to be satisfi now
said flambeau rather bitterli all pari will cheer him
now our curs colonel ha turn tail

dont talk so loud said father brown lower hi voic
your curs colonel is just in front

the other two start and shrank farther back into the shadow
of the wall for the sturdi figur of their runaway princip
could inde be seen shuffl along in the twilight in front
a bag in each hand he look much the same as when they first saw him
except that he had chang hi picturesqu mountain knicker
for a convent pair of trouser it wa clear he wa alreadi
escap from the hotel

the lane down which they follow him wa one of those that
seem to be at the back of thing and look like the wrong side
of the stage sceneri a colourless continu wall ran down
one flank of it interrupt at interv by dull-hu and
dirt-stain door all shut fast and featureless save for
the chalk scribbl of some pass gamin the top of tree
mostli rather depress evergreen show at interv over
the top of the wall and beyond them in the grey and purpl gloam
could be seen the back of some long terrac of tall parisian hous
realli compar close but somehow look as inaccess
as a rang of marbl mountain on the other side of the lane ran
the high gilt rail of a gloomi park

flambeau wa look round him in rather a weird way
do you know he said there is someth about thi place that--

hullo! call out the duke sharply; that fellow disappear
vanish like a blast fairy!

he ha a key explain their cleric friend he onli gone
into one of these garden door and as he spoke they heard one of
the dull wooden door close again with a click in front of them

flambeau strode up to the door thu shut almost in hi face
and stood in front of it for a moment bite hi black moustach
in a furi of curios then he threw up hi long arm and
swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall
hi enorm figur dark against the purpl sky like the dark tree-top

the duke look at the priest dubosc escap is
more elabor than we thought he said; but i suppos he is
escap from franc

he is escap from everywher answer father brown

valog eye brighten but hi voic sank do you mean
suicide? he ask

you will not find hi bodi repli the other

a kind of cri came from flambeau on the wall abov
my god he exclaim in french i know what thi place is now!
whi it the back of the street where old hirsch live i thought
i could recogn the back of a hous as well as the back of a man

and dubosc gone in there! cri the duke smite hi hip
whi theyll meet after all! and with sudden gallic vivac
he hop up on the wall besid flambeau and sat there posit
kick hi leg with excit the priest alon remain below
lean against the wall with hi back to the whole theatr of event
and look wist across to the park pale and the twinkl
twilit tree

the duke howev stimul had the instinct of an aristocrat
and desir rather to stare at the hous than to spi on it;
but flambeau who had the instinct of a burglar (and a detective)
had alreadi swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggl tree
from which he could crawl quit close to the onli illumin window
in the back of the high dark hous a red blind had been pull down
over the light but pull crookedli so that it gape on one side
and by risk hi neck along a branch that look as treacher
as a twig flambeau could just see colonel dubosc walk about
in a brilliantly-light and luxuri bedroom but close as flambeau wa
to the hous he heard the word of hi colleagu by the wall
and repeat them in a low voic

ye they will meet now after all!

they will never meet said father brown hirsch wa right
when he said that in such an affair the princip must not meet
have you read a queer psycholog stori by henri jame
of two person who so perpetu miss meet each other by accid
that they began to feel quit frighten of each other and to think
it wa fate? thi is someth of the kind but more curiou

there are peopl in pari who will cure them of such morbid fanci
said valogn vindict they will jolli well have to meet
if we captur them and forc them to fight

they will not meet on the day of judgement said the priest
if god almighti held the truncheon of the list if st michael
blew the trumpet for the sword to cross--even then if one of them
stood readi the other would not come

oh what doe all thi mystic mean? cri the duc de valogn
impatiently; whi on earth shouldnt they meet like other people?

they are the opposit of each other said father brown
with a queer kind of smile they contradict each other
they cancel out so to speak

he continu to gaze at the darken tree opposit but valogn
turn hi head sharpli at a suppress exclam from flambeau
that investig peer into the light room had just seen
the colonel after a pace or two proceed to take hi coat off
flambeau first thought wa that thi realli look like a fight;
but he soon drop the thought for anoth the solid and
squar of dubosc chest and shoulder wa all a power piec
of pad and came off with hi coat in hi shirt and trouser
he wa a compar slim gentleman who walk across the bedroom to
the bathroom with no more pugnaci purpos than that of wash himself
he bent over a basin dri hi drip hand and face on a towel
and turn again so that the strong light fell on hi face
hi brown complexion had gone hi big black moustach had gone;
he--wa clean-shaven and veri pate noth remain of the colonel
but hi bright hawk-lik brown eye under the wall father brown
wa go on in heavi medit as if to himself

it is all just like what i wa say to flambeau
these opposit wont do they dont work they dont fight
if it white instead of black and solid instead of liquid
and so on all along the line--then there someth wrong monsieur
there someth wrong one of these men is fair and the other dark
one stout and the other slim one strong and the other weak
one ha a moustach and no beard so you cant see hi mouth;
the other ha a beard and no moustach so you cant see hi chin
one ha hair crop to hi skull but a scarf to hide hi neck;
the other ha low shirt-collar but long hair to bide hi skull
it all too neat and correct monsieur and there someth wrong
thing made so opposit are thing that cannot quarrel
wherev the one stick out the other sink in like a face and a mask
like a lock and a key

flambeau wa peer into the hous with a visag as white as a sheet
the occup of the room wa stand with hi back to him
but in front of a looking-glass and had alreadi fit round hi face
a sort of framework of rank red hair hang disord from the head and
cling round the jaw and chin while leav the mock mouth uncov
seen thu in the glass the white face look like the face of juda
laugh horribl and surround by caper flame of hell
for a spasm flambeau saw the fierc red-brown eye danc
then they were cover with a pair of blue spectacl slip on
a loos black coat the figur vanish toward the front of the hous
a few moment later a roar of popular applaus from the street beyond
announc that dr hirsch had onc more appear upon the balconi




iv the man in the passag


two men appear simultan at the two end of a sort of passag
run along the side of the apollo theatr in the adelphi
the even daylight in the street wa larg and lumin
opalesc and empti the passag wa compar long and dark
so each man could see the other as a mere black silhouett at the other end
nevertheless each man knew the other even in that inki outline;
for they were both men of strike appear and they hate each other

the cover passag open at one end on one of the steep street
of the adelphi and at the other on a terrac overlook
the sunset-colour river one side of the passag wa a blank wall
for the build it support wa an old unsuccess theatr restaur
now shut up the other side of the passag contain two door
one at each end neither wa what wa commonli call the stage door;
they were a sort of special and privat stage door use by
veri special perform and in thi case by the star actor
and actress in the shakespearean perform of the day
person of that emin often like to have such privat exit
and entranc for meet friend or avoid them

the two men in question were certainli two such friend
men who evid knew the door and count on their open
for each approach the door at the upper end with equal cool
and confid not howev with equal speed; but the man
who walk fast wa the man from the other end of the tunnel
so they both arriv befor the secret stage door almost at
the same instant they salut each other with civil
and wait a moment befor one of them the sharper walker
who seem to have the shorter patienc knock at the door

in thi and everyth els each man wa opposit and neither
could be call inferior as privat person both were handsom
capabl and popular as public person both were in the first public rank
but everyth about them from their glori to their good look
wa of a divers and incompar kind sir wilson seymour wa
the kind of man whose import is known to everybodi who know
the more you mix with the innermost ring in everi politi or profess
the more often you met sir wilson seymour he wa the one intellig man
on twenti unintellig committees--on everi sort of subject
from the reform of the royal academi to the project of bimetal
for greater britain in the art especi he wa omnipot
he wa so uniqu that nobodi could quit decid whether he wa
a great aristocrat who had taken up art or a great artist whom
the aristocrat had taken up but you could not meet him for five minut
without realiz that you had realli been rule by him all your life

hi appear wa distinguish in exactli the same sense;
it wa at onc convent and uniqu fashion could have found no fault
with hi high silk hat-- yet it wa unlik anyon els hat--
a littl higher perhap and ad someth to hi natur height
hi tall slender figur had a slight stoop yet it look
the revers of feebl hi hair wa silver-grey but he did not look old;
it wa worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate;
it wa curli but it did not look curl hi care point beard
made him look more manli and milit than otherwis as it doe in those
old admir of velazquez with whose dark portrait hi hous wa hung
hi grey glove were a shade bluer hi silver-knob cane a shade longer
than score of such glove and cane flap and flourish about
the theatr and the restaur

the other man wa not so tall yet would have struck nobodi as short
but mere as strong and handsom hi hair also wa curli
but fair and crop close to a strong massiv head--th sort of head
you break a door with as chaucer said of the miller
hi militari moustach and the carriag of hi shoulder
show him a soldier but he had a pair of those peculiar frank
and pierc blue eye which are more common in sailor
hi face wa somewhat squar hi jaw wa squar hi shoulder
were squar even hi jacket wa squar inde in the wild school
of caricatur then current mr max beerbohm had repres him as
a proposit in the fourth book of euclid

for he also wa a public man though with quit anoth
sort of success you did not have to be in the best societi
to have heard of captain cutler of the sieg of hong-kong
and the great march across china you could not get away from
hear of him wherev you were; hi portrait wa on everi other postcard;
hi map and battl in everi other illustr paper; song in hi honour
in everi other music-hal turn or on everi other barrel-organ
hi fame though probabl more temporari wa ten time more wide
popular and spontan than the other man in thousand of
english home he appear enorm abov england like nelson
yet he had infinit less power in england than sir wilson seymour

the door wa open to them by an age servant or dresser
whose broken-down face and figur and black shabbi coat and trouser
contrast queerli with the glitter interior of the great actresss
dressing-room it wa fit and fill with looking-glass
at everi angl of refract so that they look like the hundr facet
of one huge diamond--if one could get insid a diamond
the other featur of luxuri a few flower a few colour cushion
a few scrap of stage costum were multipli by all the mirror into
the mad of the arabian night and danc and chang place
perpetu as the shuffl attend shift a mirror outward
or shot one back against the wall

they both spoke to the dingi dresser by name call him parkinson
and ask for the ladi as miss aurora rome parkinson said she wa
in the other room but he would go and tell her a shade cross the brow
of both visitors; for the other room wa the privat room of
the great actor with whom miss aurora wa perform and she wa
of the kind that doe not inflam admir without inflam jealousi
in about half a minut howev the inner door open and she enter
as she alway did even in privat life so that the veri silenc
seem to be a roar of applaus and one well-deserv
she wa clad in a somewhat strang garb of peacock green and
peacock blue satin that gleam like blue and green metal
such as delight children and aesthet and her heavi hot brown hair
frame one of those magic face which are danger to all men
but especi to boy and to men grow grey in compani with
her male colleagu the great american actor isidor bruno
she wa produc a particularli poetic and fantast interpret
of midsumm night dream: in which the artist promin wa given
to oberon and titania or in other word to bruno and herself
set in dreami and exquisit sceneri and move in mystic danc
the green costum like burnish beetle-w express all the
elus individu of an elfin queen but when person confront
in what wa still broad daylight a man look onli at the woman face

she greet both men with the beam and baffl smile
which kept so mani male at the same just danger distanc from her
she accept some flower from cutler which were as tropic and expens
as hi victories; and anoth sort of present from sir wilson seymour
offer later on and more nonchalantli by that gentleman
for it wa against hi breed to show eager and against hi
convent unconvention to give anyth so obviou as flower
he had pick up a trifl he said which wa rather a curios
it wa an ancient greek dagger of the mycenaean epoch and might well
have been worn in the time of theseu and hippolyta it wa made of brass
like all the heroic weapon but oddli enough sharp enough
to prick anyon still he had realli been attract to it by
the leaf-lik shape; it wa as perfect as a greek vase
if it wa of ani interest to miss rome or could come in anywher
in the play he hope she would--

the inner door burst open and a big figur appear who wa
more of a contrast to the explanatori seymour than even captain cutler
nearli six-foot-six and of more than theatric thew and muscl
isidor bruno in the gorgeou leopard skin and golden-brown garment
of oberon look like a barbar god he lean on a sort of
hunting-spear which across a theatr look a slight silveri wand
but which in the small and compar crowd room look as plain as
a pike-staff--and as menac hi vivid black eye roll volcan
hi bronz face handsom as it wa show at that moment
a combin of high cheekbon with set white teeth which recal
certain american conjectur about hi origin in the southern plantat

aurora he began in that deep voic like a drum of passion
that had move so mani audienc will you--

he stop indecis becaus a sixth figur had suddenli
present itself just insid the doorway--a figur so incongru
in the scene as to be almost comic it wa a veri short man in
the black uniform of the roman secular clergi and look
(especi in such a presenc as bruno and auroras) rather like
the wooden noah out of an ark he did not howev seem consciou
of ani contrast but said with dull civility: i believ miss rome
sent for me

a shrewd observ might have remark that the emot temperatur
rather rose at so unemot an interrupt the detach of
a profession celib seem to reveal to the other that they
stood round the woman as a ring of amor rivals; just as a stranger
come in with frost on hi coat will reveal that a room is like a furnac
the presenc of the one man who did not care about her
increas miss rome sens that everybodi els wa in love with her
and each in a somewhat danger way: the actor with all the appetit
of a savag and a spoilt child; the soldier with all the simpl selfish
of a man of will rather than mind; sir wilson with that daili harden
concentr with which old hedonist take to a hobby; nay
even the abject parkinson who had known her befor her triumph
and who follow her about the room with eye or feet
with the dumb fascin of a dog

a shrewd person might also have note a yet odder thing
the man like a black wooden noah (who wa not wholli without shrewdness)
note it with a consider but contain amus it wa evid
that the great aurora though by no mean indiffer to the admir
of the other sex want at thi moment to get rid of all the men
who admir her and be left alon with the man who did not--
did not admir her in that sens at least; for the littl priest
did admir and even enjoy the firm feminin diplomaci with which
she set about her task there wa perhap onli one thing
that aurora rome wa clever about and that wa one half of humanity--
the other half the littl priest watch like a napoleon campaign
the swift precis of her polici for expel all while banish none
bruno the big actor wa so babyish that it wa easi to send him off
in brute sulk bang the door cutler the british offic
wa pachydermat to idea but punctili about behaviour
he would ignor all hint but he would die rather than
ignor a definit commiss from a ladi as to old seymour
he had to be treat differently; he had to be left to the last
the onli way to move him wa to appeal to him in confid as an old
friend to let him into the secret of the clearanc the priest did
realli admir miss rome as she achiev all these three object
in one select action

she went across to captain cutler and said in her sweetest manner:
i shall valu all these flower becaus they must be your
favourit flower but they wont be complet you know
without my favourit flower do go over to that shop round the corner
and get me some lilies-of-the-valley and then it will be quit love

the first object of her diplomaci the exit of the enrag bruno
wa at onc achiev he had alreadi hand hi spear in a lordli style
like a sceptr to the piteou parkinson and wa about to assum
one of the cushion seat like a throne but at thi open appeal to
hi rival there glow in hi opal eyebal all the sensit insol
of the slave; he knot hi enorm brown fist for an instant
and then dash open the door disappear into hi own apart beyond
but meanwhil miss rome experi in mobil the british armi
had not succeed so simpli as seem probabl cutler had inde
risen stiffli and suddenli and walk toward the door hatless
as if at a word of command but perhap there wa someth
ostentati eleg about the languid figur of seymour lean against
one of the looking-glass that brought him up short at the entranc
turn hi head thi way and that like a bewild bulldog

i must show thi stupid man where to go said aurora
in a whisper to seymour and ran out to the threshold to speed
the part guest

seymour seem to be listen eleg and unconsci
as wa hi postur and he seem reliev when he heard the ladi call out
some last instruct to the captain and then turn sharpli
and run laugh down the passag toward the other end
the end on the terrac abov the thame yet a second or two after
seymour brow darken again a man in hi posit ha so mani rival
and he rememb that at the other end of the passag wa
the correspond entranc to bruno privat room he did not
lose hi dignity; he said some civil word to father brown
about the reviv of byzantin architectur in the westminst cathedr
and then quit natur stroll out himself into the upper end
of the passag father brown and parkinson were left alon
and they were neither of them men with a tast for superflu convers
the dresser went round the room pull out looking-glass
and push them in again hi dingi dark coat and trouser look
all the more dismal sinc he wa still hold the festiv fairi spear
of king oberon everi time he pull out the frame of a new glass
a new black figur of father brown appeared; the absurd glass chamber
wa full of father brown upsid down in the air like angel
turn somersault like acrobat turn their back to everybodi
like veri rude person

father brown seem quit unconsci of thi cloud of wit
but follow parkinson with an idli attent eye till he took himself
and hi absurd spear into the farther room of bruno then he abandon
himself to such abstract medit as alway amus him--
calcul the angl of the mirror the angl of each refract
the angl at which each must fit into the wallwhen he heard
a strong but strangl cri

he sprang to hi feet and stood rigidli listen
at the same instant sir wilson seymour burst back into the room
white as ivori who that man in the passage? he cri
where that dagger of mine?

befor father brown could turn in hi heavi boot seymour wa
plung about the room look for the weapon and befor he could
possibl find that weapon or ani other a brisk run of feet
broke upon the pavement outsid and the squar face of cutler
wa thrust into the same doorway he wa still grotesqu grasp
a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley what this? he cri
what that creatur down the passage? is thi some of your tricks?

my tricks! hiss hi pale rival and made a stride toward him

in the instant of time in which all thi happen father brown
step out into the top of the passag look down it
and at onc walk briskli toward what he saw

at thi the other two men drop their quarrel and dart after him
cutler call out: what are you doing? who are you?

my name is brown said the priest sadli as he bent over someth
and straighten himself again miss rome sent for me
and i came as quickli as i could i have come too late

the three men look down and in one of them at least
the life die in that late light of afternoon it ran along
the passag like a path of gold and in the midst of it aurora rome lay
lustrou in her robe of green and gold with her dead face
turn upward her dress wa torn away as in a struggl
leav the right shoulder bare but the wound from which
the blood wa well wa on the other side the brass dagger
lay flat and gleam a yard or so away

there wa a blank still for a measur time so that
they could hear far off a flower-girl laugh outsid chare cross
and someon whistl furious for a taxicab in one of the street
off the strand then the captain with a movement so sudden that it
might have been passion or play-act took sir wilson seymour by the
throat

seymour look at him steadili without either fight or fear
you need not kill me he said in a voic quit cold; i shall do
that on my own account

the captain hand hesit and dropped; and the other ad
with the same ici candour: if i find i havent the nerv
to do it with that dagger i can do it in a month with drink

drink isnt good enough for me repli cutler but ill have
blood for thi befor i die not yours--but i think i know whose

and befor the other could appreci hi intent
he snatch up the dagger sprang at the other door at the lower end
of the passag burst it open bolt and all and confront bruno
in hi dressing-room as he did so old parkinson totter
in hi waver way out of the door and caught sight of the corps
lie in the passag he move shakili toward it; look at it weakli
with a work face; then move shakili back into the dressing-room again
and sat down suddenli on one of the richli cushion chair
father brown instantli ran across to him take no notic of cutler
and the coloss actor though the room alreadi rang with their blow
and they began to struggl for the dagger seymour who retain some
practic sens wa whistl for the polic at the end of the passag

when the polic arriv it wa to tear the two men
from an almost ape-lik grapple; and after a few formal inquiri
to arrest isidor bruno upon a charg of murder brought against him
by hi furiou oppon the idea that the great nation hero of the hour
had arrest a wrongdoer with hi own hand doubtless had it weight
with the polic who are not without element of the journalist
they treat cutler with a certain solemn attent and point out
that he had got a slight slash on the hand even as cutler
bore him back across tilt chair and tabl bruno had twist
the dagger out of hi grasp and disabl him just below the wrist
the injuri wa realli slight but till he wa remov from the room
the half-savag prison stare at the run blood with a steadi smile

look a cannib sort of chap dont he? said the constabl
confidenti to cutler

cutler made no answer but said sharpli a moment after:
we must attend to theth death and hi voic escap
from articul

the two death came in the voic of the priest from
the farther side of the room thi poor fellow wa gone
when i got across to him and he stood look down at old parkinson
who sat in a black huddl on the gorgeou chair he also had
paid hi tribut not without eloqu to the woman who had die

the silenc wa first broken by cutler who seem not untouch
by a rough tender i wish i wa him he said huskili
i rememb he use to watch her wherev she walk more than--anybodi
she wa hi air and he dri up he just dead

we are all dead said seymour in a strang voic
look down the road

they took leav of father brown at the corner of the road
with some random apolog for ani rude they might have shown
both their face were tragic but also cryptic

the mind of the littl priest wa alway a rabbit-warren
of wild thought that jump too quickli for him to catch them
like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanish thought that
he wa certain of their grief but not so certain of their innoc

we had better all be go said seymour heavily; we have done
all we can to help

will you understand my motiv ask father brown quietli
if i say you have done all you can to hurt?

they both start as if guiltili and cutler said sharply:
to hurt whom?

to hurt yourselv answer the priest i would not
add to your troubl if it werent common justic to warn you
youv done nearli everyth you could do to hang yourselv
if thi actor should be acquit theyll be sure to subpoena me;
i shall be bound to say that after the cri wa heard each of you
rush into the room in a wild state and began quarrel about a dagger
as far as my word on oath can go you might either of you have done it
you hurt yourselv with that; and then captain cutler must have
hurt himself with the dagger

hurt myself! exclaim the captain with contempt
a silli littl scratch

which drew blood repli the priest nod we know there
blood on the brass now and so we shall never know whether there wa
blood on it befor

there wa a silence; and then seymour said with an emphasi
quit alien to hi daili accent: but i saw a man in the passag

i know you did answer the cleric brown with a face of wood
so did captain cutler that what seem so improb

befor either could make suffici sens of it even to answer
father brown had polit excus himself and gone stump
up the road with hi stumpi old umbrella

as modern newspap are conduct the most honest
and most import news is the polic news if it be true that
in the twentieth centuri more space is given to murder than to polit
it is for the excel reason that murder is a more seriou subject
but even thi would hardli explain the enorm omnipres and
wide distribut detail of the bruno case or the passag mysteri
in the press of london and the provinc so vast wa the excit
that for some week the press realli told the truth; and the report
of examin and cross-examin if intermin
even if intoler are at least reliabl the true reason
of cours wa the coincid of person the victim wa
a popular actress; the accus wa a popular actor; and the accus
had been caught red-hand as it were by the most popular soldier
of the patriot season in those extraordinari circumst
the press wa paralys into probiti and accuracy; and the rest of thi
somewhat singular busi can practic be record from report
of bruno trial

the trial wa presid over by mr justic monkhous
one of those who are jeer at as humor judg but who are gener
much more seriou than the seriou judg for their leviti come from
a live impati of profession solemnity; while the seriou judg
is realli fill with frivol becaus he is fill with vaniti
all the chief actor be of a worldli import the barrist
were well balanced; the prosecutor for the crown wa sir walter cowdray
a heavi but weighti advoc of the sort that know how to seem
english and trustworthi and how to be rhetor with reluct
the prison wa defend by mr patrick butler kc who wa mistaken
for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the irish character--
and those who had not been examin by him the medic evid
involv no contradict the doctor whom seymour had summon
on the spot agre with the emin surgeon who had later
examin the bodi aurora rome had been stab with some sharp instrument
such as a knife or dagger; some instrument at least of which
the blade wa short the wound wa just over the heart and she had
die instantli when the doctor first saw her she could hardli
have been dead for twenti minut therefor when father brown
found her she could hardli have been dead for three

some offici detect evid follow chiefli concern with
the presenc or absenc of ani proof of a struggle; the onli suggest
of thi wa the tear of the dress at the shoulder and thi did not seem
to fit in particularli well with the direct and final of the blow
when these detail had been suppli though not explain
the first of the import wit wa call

sir wilson seymour gave evid as he did everyth els
that he did at all--not onli well but perfectli though himself
much more of a public man than the judg he convey exactli
the fine shade of self-effac befor the king justice;
and though everyon look at him as they would at the prime minist
or the archbishop of canterburi they could have said noth
of hi part in it but that it wa that of a privat gentleman
with an accent on the noun he wa also refreshingli lucid
as he wa on the committe he had been call on miss rome
at the theatre; he had met captain cutler there; they had been join
for a short time by the accus who had then return to hi
own dressing-room; they had then been join by a roman cathol priest
who ask for the deceas ladi and said hi name wa brown
miss rome had then gone just outsid the theatr to the entranc
of the passag in order to point out to captain cutler a flower-shop
at which he wa to buy her some more flowers; and the wit
had remain in the room exchang a few word with the priest
he had then distinctli heard the deceas have sent the captain
on hi errand turn round laugh and run down the passag
toward it other end where wa the prison dressing-room
in idl curios as to the rapid movement of hi friend
he had stroll out to the head of the passag himself and look down it
toward the prison door did he see anyth in the passage?
yes; he saw someth in the passag

sir walter cowdray allow an impress interv
dure which the wit look down and for all hi usual composur
seem to have more than hi usual pallor then the barrist said
in a lower voic which seem at onc sympathet and creepy:
did you see it distinctly?

sir wilson seymour howev move had hi excel brain
in full working-ord veri distinctli as regard it outlin
but quit indistinctli inde not at all as regard the detail
insid the outlin the passag is of such length that anyon in
the middl of it appear quit black against the light at the other end
the wit lower hi steadi eye onc more and added:
i had notic the fact befor when captain cutler first enter it
there wa anoth silenc and the judg lean forward and made a note

well said sir walter patient what wa the outlin like?
wa it for instanc like the figur of the murder woman?

not in the least answer seymour quietli

what did it look like to you?

it look to me repli the wit like a tall man

everyon in court kept hi eye rivet on hi pen
or hi umbrella-handl or hi book or hi boot or whatev
he happen to be look at they seem to be hold their eye
away from the prison by main force; but they felt hi figur in the dock
and they felt it as gigant tall as bruno wa to the eye
he seem to swell taller and taller when an eye had been
torn away from him

cowdray wa resum hi seat with hi solemn face
smooth hi black silk robe and white silk whisker
sir wilson wa leav the witness-box after a few final particular
to which there were mani other wit when the counsel for the defenc
sprang up and stop him

i shall onli detain you a moment said mr butler
who wa a rustic-look person with red eyebrow and an express
of partial slumber will you tell hi lordship how you knew
it wa a man?

a faint refin smile seem to pass over seymour featur
im afraid it is the vulgar test of trouser he said
when i saw daylight between the long leg i wa sure it wa a man
after all

butler sleepi eye open as suddenli as some silent explos
after all! he repeat slowli so you did think at first
it wa a woman?

seymour look troubl for the first time it is hardli
a point of fact he said but if hi lordship would like me
to answer for my impress of cours i shall do so there wa someth
about the thing that wa not exactli a woman and yet wa not quit a man;
somehow the curv were differ and it had someth that look like
long hair

thank you said mr butler kc and sat down suddenli
as if he had got what he want

captain cutler wa a far less plausibl and compos wit
than sir wilson but hi account of the open incid wa
solidli the same he describ the return of bruno to hi dressing-room
the dispatch of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley
hi return to the upper end of the passag the thing he saw
in the passag hi suspicion of seymour and hi struggl with bruno
but he could give littl artist assist about the black figur
that he and seymour had seen ask about it outlin he said he
wa no art critic--with a somewhat too obviou sneer at seymour
ask if it wa a man or a woman he said it look more like a beast--
with a too obviou snarl at the prison but the man wa plainli shaken
with sorrow and sincer anger and cowdray quickli excus him
from confirm fact that were alreadi fairli clear

the defend counsel also wa again brief in hi cross-examination;
although (a wa hi custom) even in be brief he seem to take
a long time about it you use a rather remark express he said
look at cutler sleepili what do you mean by say that
it look more like a beast than a man or a woman?

cutler seem serious agit perhap i oughtnt to have
said that he said; but when the brute ha huge hump shoulder
like a chimpanze and bristl stick out of it head like a pig--

mr butler cut short hi curiou impati in the middl
never mind whether it hair wa like a pig he said
wa it like a womans?

a womans! cri the soldier great scott no!

the last wit said it wa comment the counsel
with unscrupul swift and did the figur have ani of those
serpentin and semi-feminin curv to which eloqu allus
ha been made? no? no feminin curves? the figur if i understand you
wa rather heavi and squar than otherwise?

he may have been bend forward said cutler in a hoars
and rather faint voic

or again he may not said mr butler and sat down suddenli
for the second time

the third wit call by sir walter cowdray wa
the littl cathol clergyman so littl compar with the other
that hi head seem hardli to come abov the box so that it wa like
cross-examin a child but unfortun sir walter had somehow
got it into hi head (mostli by some ramif of hi famili religion)
that father brown wa on the side of the prison becaus the prison
wa wick and foreign and even partli black therefor he
took father brown up sharpli whenev that proud pontiff tri
to explain anything; and told him to answer ye or no and tell
the plain fact without ani jesuitri when father brown began
in hi simplic to say who he thought the man in the passag wa
the barrist told him that he did not want hi theori

a black shape wa seen in the passag and you say you saw
the black shape well what shape wa it?

father brown blink as under rebuke; but he had long known
the liter natur of obedi the shape he said wa short
and thick but had two sharp black project curv upward
on each side of the head or top rather like horn and--

oh! the devil with horn no doubt ejacul cowdray
sit down in triumphant jocular it wa the devil come
to eat protest

no said the priest dispassionately; i know who it wa

those in court had been wrought up to an irrat
but real sens of some monstros they had forgotten the figur
in the dock and thought onli of the figur in the passag
and the figur in the passag describ by three capabl
and respect men who had all seen it wa a shift nightmare:
one call it a woman and the other a beast and the other a devil

the judg wa look at father brown with level and pierc eye
you are a most extraordinari wit he said; but there is someth
about you that make me think you are tri to tell the truth
well who wa the man you saw in the passage?

he wa myself said father brown

butler kc sprang to hi feet in an extraordinari still
and said quit calmly: your lordship will allow me to cross-examine?
and then without stop he shot at brown the appar
disconnect question: you have heard about thi dagger;
you know the expert say the crime wa commit with a short blade?

a short blade assent brown nod solemnli like an owl
but a veri long hilt

befor the audienc could quit dismiss the idea that the priest
had realli seen himself do murder with a short dagger with a long hilt
(which seem somehow to make it more horrible) he had himself
hurri on to explain

i mean dagger arent the onli thing with short blade
spear have short blade and spear catch at the end of the steel
just like dagger if theyr that sort of fanci spear they had
in theatres; like the spear poor old parkinson kill hi wife with
just when shed sent for me to settl their famili troubles--
and i came just too late god forgiv me! but he die penitent--
he just die of be penit he couldnt bear what hed done

the gener impress in court wa that the littl priest
who wa gobbl away had liter gone mad in the box
but the judg still look at him with bright and steadi eye of interest;
and the counsel for the defenc went on with hi question unperturb

if parkinson did it with that pantomim spear said butler
he must have thrust from four yard away how do you account for
sign of struggl like the dress drag off the shoulder? he had
slip into treat hi mere wit as an expert; but no one
notic it now

the poor ladi dress wa torn said the wit
becaus it wa caught in a panel that slid to just behind her
she struggl to free herself and as she did so parkinson came out
of the prison room and lung with the spear

a panel? repeat the barrist in a curiou voic

it wa a looking-glass on the other side explain father brown
when i wa in the dressing-room i notic that some of them
could probabl be slid out into the passag

there wa anoth vast and unnatur silenc and thi time
it wa the judg who spoke so you realli mean that when you
look down that passag the man you saw wa yourself--in a mirror?

ye my lord; that wa what i wa tri to say said brown
but they ask me for the shape; and our hat have corner
just like horn and so i--

the judg lean forward hi old eye yet more brilliant
and said in special distinct tones: do you realli mean to say that
when sir wilson seymour saw that wild what-you-call-him with curv
and a woman hair and a man trouser what he saw wa
sir wilson seymour?

ye my lord said father brown

and you mean to say that when captain cutler saw that chimpanze
with hump shoulder and hog bristl he simpli saw himself?

ye my lord

the judg lean back in hi chair with a luxuri in which
it wa hard to separ the cynic and the admir
and can you tell us whi he ask you should know your own figur
in a looking-glass when two such distinguish men dont?

father brown blink even more pain than before;
then he stammered: realli my lord i dont know unless it becaus
i dont look at it so often




v the mistak of the machin


flambeau and hi friend the priest were sit in the templ garden
about sunset; and their neighbourhood or some such accident influenc
had turn their talk to matter of legal process from the problem
of the licenc in cross-examin their talk stray to roman and
mediaev tortur to the examin magistr in franc and
the third degre in america

ive been read said flambeau of thi new psychometr method
they talk about so much especi in america you know what i mean;
they put a pulsomet on a man wrist and judg by how hi heart goe
at the pronunci of certain word what do you think of it?

i think it veri interest repli father brown;
it remind me of that interest idea in the dark age that blood
would flow from a corps if the murder touch it

do you realli mean demand hi friend that you think
the two method equal valuable?

i think them equal valueless repli brown blood flow
fast or slow in dead folk or live for so mani more million reason
than we can ever know blood will have to flow veri funnily;
blood will have to flow up the matterhorn befor i will take it
as a sign that i am to shed it

the method remark the other ha been guarante
by some of the greatest american men of scienc

what sentimentalist men of scienc are! exclaim father brown
and how much more sentiment must american men of scienc be!
who but a yanke would think of prove anyth from heart-throbs?
whi they must be as sentiment as a man who think a woman
is in love with him if she blush that a test from
the circul of the blood discov by the immort harvey;
and a jolli rotten test too

but sure insist flambeau it might point pretti straight
at someth or other

there a disadvantag in a stick point straight
answer the other what is it? whi the other end of the stick
alway point the opposit way it depend whether you
get hold of the stick by the right end i saw the thing done onc
and ive never believ in it sinc and he proceed to tell
the stori of hi disillusion

it happen nearli twenti year befor when he wa chaplain
to hi co-religionist in a prison in chicago--wher the irish popul
display a capac both for crime and penit which kept him
toler busi the offici second-in-command under the governor
wa an ex-detect name greywood usher a cadaver careful-spoken
yanke philosoph occasion vari a veri rigid visag
with an odd apologet grimac he like father brown in
a slightli patron way; and father brown like him
though he heartili dislik hi theori hi theori were
extrem complic and were held with extrem simplic

one even he had sent for the priest who accord to hi custom
took a seat in silenc at a tabl pile and litter with paper
and wait the offici select from the paper a scrap of
newspap cut which he hand across to the cleric
who read it grave it appear to be an extract from one of
the pinkest of american societi paper and ran as follows:

societi brightest widow is onc more on the freak dinner stunt
all our exclus citizen will recal the perambul parad dinner
in which last-trick todd at hi palati home at pilgrim pond
caus so mani of our promin debutant to look even younger
than their year equal eleg and more miscellan and
large-heart in social outlook wa last-trick show the year previou
the popular cannib crush lunch at which the confect hand round
were sarcast mould in the form of human arm and leg
and dure which more than one of our gayest mental gymnast wa heard
offer to eat hi partner the wittic which will inspir
thi even is as yet in mr todd pretti retic intellect
or lock in the jewel bosom of our citi gayest leaders;
but there is talk of a pretti parodi of the simpl manner and custom
at the other end of societi scale thi would be all the more tell
as hospit todd is entertain in lord falconroy the famou travel
a true-blood aristocrat fresh from england oak-grov
lord falconroy travel began befor hi ancient feudal titl
wa resurrect he wa in the republ in hi youth and fashion murmur
a sli reason for hi return miss etta todd is one of our
deep-soul new yorker and come into an incom of nearli
twelv hundr million dollar

well ask usher doe that interest you?

whi word rather fail me answer father brown
i cannot think at thi moment of anyth in thi world that would
interest me less and unless the just anger of the republ is
at last go to electrocut journalist for write like that
i dont quit see whi it should interest you either

ah! said mr usher dryli and hand across anoth
scrap of newspap well doe that interest you?

the paragraph wa head savag murder of a warder
convict escap and ran: just befor dawn thi morn
a shout for help wa heard in the convict settlement at sequah
in thi state the author hurri in the direct of the cri
found the corps of the warder who patrol the top of the north wall
of the prison the steepest and most difficult exit for which one man
ha alway been found suffici the unfortun offic had
howev been hurl from the high wall hi brain beaten out
as with a club and hi gun wa miss further inquiri show that
one of the cell wa empty; it had been occupi by a rather sullen ruffian
give hi name as oscar rian he wa onli temporarili detain
for some compar trivial assault; but he gave everyon the impress
of a man with a black past and a danger futur final
when daylight bad fulli reveal the scene of murder it wa found
that he had written on the wall abov the bodi a fragmentari sentenc
appar with a finger dip in blood: `thi wa self-def and
he had the gun i meant no harm to him or ani man but one
i am keep the bullet for pilgrim pond--or a man must have use
most fiendish treacheri or most savag and amaz bodili dare
to have storm such a wall in spite of an arm man

well the literari style is somewhat improv admit the priest
cheer but still i dont see what i can do for you
i should cut a poor figur with my short leg run about thi state
after an athlet assassin of that sort i doubt whether
anybodi could find him the convict settlement at sequah
is thirti mile from here; the countri between is wild and tangl enough
and the countri beyond where he will sure have the sens to go
is a perfect no-man land tumbl away to the prairi
he may be in ani hole or up ani tree

he isnt in ani hole said the governor; he isnt up ani tree

whi how do you know? ask father brown blink

would you like to speak to him? inquir usher

father brown open hi innoc eye wide he is here?
he exclaim whi how did your men get hold of him?

i got hold of him myself drawl the american rise and
lazili stretch hi lanki leg befor the fire i got hold of him
with the crook end of a walking-stick dont look so surpris
i realli did you know i sometim take a turn in the countri lane
outsid thi dismal place; well i wa walk earli thi even
up a steep lane with dark hedg and grey-look plough field
on both sides; and a young moon wa up and silver the road
by the light of it i saw a man run across the field toward the road;
run with hi bodi bent and at a good mile-rac trot
he appear to be much exhausted; but when he came to the thick black hedg
he went through it as if it were made of spider webs; --or rather
(for i heard the strong branch break and snap like bayonets)
as if he himself were made of stone in the instant in which
he appear up against the moon cross the road i slung my hook cane
at hi leg trip him and bring him down then i blew my whistl
long and loud and our fellow came run up to secur him

it would have been rather awkward remark brown
if you had found he wa a popular athlet practis a mile race

he wa not said usher grimli we soon found out who he was;
but i had guess it with the first glint of the moon on him

you thought it wa the runaway convict observ the priest simpli
becaus you had read in the newspap cut that morn that
a convict had run away

i had somewhat better ground repli the governor coolli
i pass over the first as too simpl to be emphasized--
i mean that fashion athlet do not run across plough field
or scratch their eye out in brambl hedg nor do they run
all doubl up like a crouch dog there were more decis detail
to a fairli well-train eye the man wa clad in coars
and rag cloth but they were someth more than mere
coars and rag they were so ill-fit as to be quit grotesque;
even as he appear in black outlin against the moonris
the coat-collar in which hi head wa buri made him look
like a hunchback and the long loos sleev look as if he had no hand
it at onc occur to me that he had somehow manag to chang
hi convict cloth for some confeder cloth which did not fit him
second there wa a pretti stiff wind against which he wa running;
so that i must have seen the streaki look of blow hair if the hair
had not been veri short then i rememb that beyond these
plough field he wa cross lay pilgrim pond for which
(you will remember) the convict wa keep hi bullet;
and i sent my walking-stick fli

a brilliant piec of rapid deduct said father brown;
but had he got a gun?

as usher stop abruptli in hi walk the priest ad apologetically:
ive been told a bullet is not half so use without it

he had no gun said the other gravely; but that wa doubtless
due to some veri natur mischanc or chang of plan probabl the
same polici that made him chang the cloth made him drop the gun;
he began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood
of hi victim

well that is possibl enough answer the priest

and it hardli worth specul on said usher
turn to some other paper for we know it the man by thi time

hi cleric friend ask faintly: but how? and greywood usher
threw down the newspap and took up the two press-cut again

well sinc you are so obstin he said let begin
at the begin you will notic that these two cut have onli
one thing in common which is the mention of pilgrim pond
the estat as you know of the millionair ireton todd
you also know that he is a remark character; one of those
that rose on stepping-stones--

of our dead selv to higher thing assent hi companion
yes; i know that petroleum i think

anyhow said usher last-trick todd count for a great deal
in thi rum affair

he stretch himself onc more befor the fire and continu talk
in hi expans radiantli explanatori style

to begin with on the face of it there is no mysteri here at all
it is not mysteri it is not even odd that a jailbird should
take hi gun to pilgrim pond our peopl arent like the english
who will forgiv a man for be rich if he throw away money
on hospit or hors last-trick todd ha made himself big
by hi own consider abilities; and there no doubt that
mani of those on whom he ha shown hi abil would like to
show their on him with a shot-gun todd might easili get drop
by some man hed never even heard of; some labour hed lock out
or some clerk in a busi hed bust last-trick is a man
of mental endow and a high public character; but in thi countri
the relat of employ and employ are consider strain

that how the whole thing look suppos thi rian
made for pilgrim pond to kill todd so it look to me
till anoth littl discoveri woke up what i have of the detect in me
when i had my prison safe i pick up my cane again and stroll down
the two or three turn of countri road that brought me to one of
the side entranc of todd ground the one nearest to the pool
or lake after which the place is name it wa some two hour ago
about seven by thi time; the moonlight wa more lumin
and i could see the long white streak of it lie on the mysteri mere
with it grey greasi half-liquid shore in which they say
our father use to make witch walk until they sank
id forgotten the exact tale; but you know the place i mean;
it lie north of todd hous toward the wilder and ha two queer
wrinkl tree so dismal that they look more like huge fungoid
than decent foliag as i stood peer at thi misti pool
i fanci i saw the faint figur of a man move from the hous toward it
but it wa all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact
and still less of the detail besid my attent wa veri sharpli
arrest by someth much closer i crouch behind the fenc
which ran not more than two hundr yard from one wing of
the great mansion and which wa fortun split in place
as if special for the applic of a cautiou eye a door had open
in the dark bulk of the left wing and a figur appear black against
the illumin interior--a muffl figur bend forward
evid peer out into the night it close the door behind it
and i saw it wa carri a lantern which threw a patch of imperfect light
on the dress and figur of the wearer it seem to be
the figur of a woman wrap up in a rag cloak and
evid disguis to avoid notice; there wa someth veri strang
both about the rag and the furtiv in a person come out of
those room line with gold she took cautious the curv garden path
which brought her within half a hundr yard of me-- then she stood up
for an instant on the terrac of turf that look toward the slimi lake
and hold her flame lantern abov her head she deliber swung it
three time to and fro as for a signal as she swung it the second time
a flicker of it light fell for a moment on her own face
a face that i knew she wa unnatur pale and her head wa bundl
in her borrow plebeian shawl; but i am certain it wa etta todd
the millionair daughter

she retrac her step in equal secreci and the door
close behind her again i wa about to climb the fenc and follow
when i realiz that the detect fever that had lure me
into the adventur wa rather undignified; and that in a more
authorit capac i alreadi held all the card in my hand
i wa just turn away when a new nois broke on the night
a window wa thrown up in one of the upper floor but just round
the corner of the hous so that i could not see it; and a voic
of terribl distinct wa heard shout across the dark garden
to know where lord falconroy wa for he wa miss from everi room
in the hous there wa no mistak that voic i have
heard it on mani a polit platform or meet of directors;
it wa ireton todd himself some of the other seem to have gone
to the lower window or on to the step and were call up to him
that falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the pilgrim pond
an hour befor and could not be trace sinc then todd cri
`mighti murder! and shut down the window violently; and i could hear him
plung down the stair insid repossess myself of my former
and wiser purpos i whip out of the way of the gener search
that must follow; and return here not later than eight oclock

i now ask you to recal that littl societi paragraph
which seem to you so pain lack in interest if the convict
wa not keep the shot for todd as he evid wasnt
it is most like that he wa keep it for lord falconroy;
and it look as if he had deliv the good no more handi place
to shoot a man than in the curiou geolog surround of that pool
where a bodi thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth
practic unknown let us suppos then that our friend
with the crop hair came to kill falconroy and not todd
but as i have point out there are mani reason whi peopl in america
might want to kill todd there is no reason whi anybodi in america
should want to kill an english lord newli land except for the one reason
mention in the pink paper--that the lord is pay hi attent
to the millionair daughter our crop-hair friend
despit hi ill-fit cloth must be an aspir lover

i know the notion will seem to you jar and even comic;
but that becaus you are english it sound to you like say
the archbishop of canterburi daughter will be marri in
st georg hanov squar to a crossing-sweep on ticket-of-leav
you dont do justic to the climb and aspir power of our
more remark citizen you see a good-look grey-hair man
in evening-dress with a sort of author about him you know he is
a pillar of the state and you fanci he had a father you are in error
you do not realiz that a compar few year ago he may have been
in a tenement or (quit likely) in a jail you dont allow for our
nation buoyanc and uplift mani of our most influenti citizen
have not onli risen recent but risen compar late in life
todd daughter wa fulli eighteen when her father first made hi pile;
so there isnt realli anyth imposs in her have a hanger-on
in low life; or even in her hang on to him as i think
she must be do to judg by the lantern busi if so
the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnect with the hand
that held the gun thi case sir will make a nois

well said the priest patient and what did you do next?

i reckon youll be shock repli greywood usher
as i know you dont cotton to the march of scienc in these matter
i am given a good deal of discret here and perhap take a littl more
than im given; and i thought it wa an excel opportun to test
that psychometr machin i told you about now in my opinion
that machin cant lie

no machin can lie said father brown; nor can it tell the truth

it did in thi case as ill show you went on usher posit
i sat the man in the ill-fit cloth in a comfort chair
and simpli wrote word on a blackboard; and the machin simpli
record the variat of hi pulse; and i simpli observ hi manner
the trick is to introduc some word connect with the suppos crime
in a list of word connect with someth quit differ
yet a list in which it occur quit natur thu i wrote `heron and
`eagl and `owl and when i wrote `falcon he wa tremend agitated;
and when i began to make an `r at the end of the word
that machin just bound who els in thi republ ha ani reason
to jump at the name of a newly-arriv englishman like falconroy
except the man who shot him? isnt that better evid than
a lot of gabbl from witnesses--if the evid of a reliabl machine?

you alway forget observ hi companion that the reliabl machin
alway ha to be work by an unreli machin

whi what do you mean? ask the detect

i mean man said father brown the most unreli machin
i know of i dont want to be rude; and i dont think you will consid
man to be an offens or inaccur descript of yourself
you say you observ hi manner; but how do you know you observ it right?
you say the word have to come in a natur way; but how do you know
that you did it naturally? how do you know if you come to that
that he did not observ your manner? who is to prove that you were not
tremend agitated? there wa no machin tie on to your puls

i tell you cri the american in the utmost excit
i wa as cool as a cucumb

crimin also can be as cool as cucumb said brown
with a smile and almost as cool as you

well thi one wasnt said usher throw the paper about
oh you make me tired!

im sorri said the other i onli point out what seem
a reason possibl if you could tell by hi manner when
the word that might hang him had come whi shouldnt he tell
from your manner that the word that might hang him wa coming?
i should ask for more than word myself befor i hang anybodi

usher smote the tabl and rose in a sort of angri triumph

and that he cri is just what im go to give you
i tri the machin first just in order to test the thing in other way
afterward and the machin sir is right

he paus a moment and resum with less excit
i rather want to insist if it come to that that so far
i had veri littl to go on except the scientif experi
there wa realli noth against the man at all hi cloth were
ill-fit as ive said but they were rather better if anyth
than those of the submerg class to which he evid belong
moreov under all the stain of hi plung through plough field
or burst through dusti hedg the man wa compar clean
thi might mean of cours that he had onli just broken prison;
but it remind me more of the desper decenc of the compar
respect poor hi demeanour wa i am bound to confess
quit in accord with their he wa silent and dignifi as they are;
he seem to have a big but buri grievanc as they do
he profess total ignor of the crime and the whole question;
and show noth but a sullen impati for someth sensibl
that might come to take him out of hi meaningless scrape
he ask me more than onc if he could telephon for a lawyer
who had help him a long time ago in a trade disput and in everi sens
act as you would expect an innoc man to act there wa noth
against him in the world except that littl finger on the dial
that point to the chang of hi puls

then sir the machin wa on it trial; and the machin wa right
by the time i came with him out of the privat room into the vestibul
where all sort of other peopl were await examin
i think he had alreadi more or less made up hi mind to clear thing up
by someth like a confess he turn to me and began to say
in a low voice: `oh i cant stick thi ani more if you must know
all about me--

at the same instant one of the poor women sit on the long bench
stood up scream aloud and point at him with her finger
i have never in my life heard anyth more demoniac distinct
her lean finger seem to pick him out as if it were a pea-shoot
though the word wa a mere howl everi syllabl wa as clear
as a separ stroke on the clock

`drugger davis! she shout `theyv got drugger davis!

among the wretch women mostli thiev and streetwalk
twenti face were turn gape with glee and hate if i had never
heard the word i should have known by the veri shock upon hi featur
that the so-cal oscar rian had heard hi real name but im not quit
so ignor you may be surpris to hear drugger davi wa
one of the most terribl and deprav crimin that ever
baffl our polic it is certain he had done murder more than onc
long befor hi last exploit with the warder but he wa never entir
fix for it curious enough becaus he did it in the same manner
as those milder--or meaner--crim for which he wa fix pretti often
he wa a handsom well-bred-look brute as he still is to some extent;
and he use mostli to go about with barmaid or shop-girl and do them
out of their money veri often though he went a good deal farther;
and they were found drug with cigarett or chocol and
their whole properti miss then came one case where the girl
wa found dead; but deliber could not quit be prove and
what wa more practic still the crimin could not be found
i heard a rumour of hi have reappear somewher in the opposit
charact thi time lend money instead of borrow it;
but still to such poor widow as he might person fascin
but still with the same bad result for them well there is
your innoc man and there is hi innoc record even sinc then
four crimin and three warder have identifi him and confirm the stori
now what have you got to say to my poor littl machin after that?
hasnt the machin done for him? or do you prefer to say that the woman
and i have done for him?

as to what youv done for him repli father brown
rise and shake himself in a floppi way youv save him from
the electr chair i dont think they can kill drugger davi
on that old vagu stori of the poison; and as for the convict
who kill the warder i suppos it obviou that you havent got him
mr davi is innoc of that crime at ani rate

what do you mean? demand the other whi should he be
innoc of that crime?

whi bless us all! cri the small man in one of hi rare
moment of anim whi becaus he guilti of the other crimes!
i dont know what you peopl are made of you seem to think that
all sin are kept togeth in a bag you talk as if a miser on monday
were alway a spendthrift on tuesday you tell me thi man you have here
spent week and month wheedl needi women out of small sum of money;
that he use a drug at the best and a poison at the worst;
that he turn up afterward as the lowest kind of moneylend
and cheat most poor peopl in the same patient and pacif style
let it be granted--let us admit for the sake of argument
that he did all thi if that is so i will tell you what he didnt do
he didnt storm a spike wall against a man with a load gun
he didnt write on the wall with hi own hand to say he had done it
he didnt stop to state that hi justif wa self-def
he didnt explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder
he didnt name the hous of the rich man to which he wa go with the gun
he didnt write hi own initi in a man blood saint alive!
cant you see the whole charact is differ in good and evil?
whi you dont seem to be like i am a bit one would think
youd never had ani vice of your own

the amaz american had alreadi part hi lip in protest
when the door of hi privat and offici room wa hammer
and rattl in an unceremoni way to which he wa total unaccustom

the door flew open the moment befor greywood usher had been
come to the conclus that father brown might possibl be mad
the moment after he began to think he wa mad himself
there burst and fell into hi privat room a man in the filthiest rag
with a greasi squash hat still askew on hi head and a shabbi green shade
shove up from one of hi eye both of which were glare like a tiger
the rest of hi face wa almost undiscover be mask with
a mat beard and whisker through which the nose could bare
thrust itself and further buri in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief
mr usher pride himself on have seen most of the roughest specimen
in the state but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dress
as a scarecrow as thi but abov all he had never in all hi
placid scientif exist heard a man like that speak to him first

see here old man usher shout the be in the red handkerchief
im get tire dont you tri ani of your hide-and-seek on me;
i dont get fool ani leav go of my guest and ill let up
on the fanci clockwork keep him here for a split instant and youll
feel pretti mean i reckon im not a man with no pull

the emin usher wa regard the bellow monster
with an amaz which had dri up all other sentiment
the mere shock to hi eye had render hi ear almost useless
at last he rang a bell with a hand of violenc while the bell wa
still strong and peal the voic of father brown fell soft but distinct

i have a suggest to make he said but it seem
a littl confus i dont know thi gentleman--but--
but i think i know him now you know him--you know him quit well--
but you dont know him--natur sound paradox i know

i reckon the cosmo is crack said usher and fell asprawl
in hi round offic chair

now see here vocifer the stranger strike the tabl
but speak in a voic that wa all the more mysteri
becaus it wa compar mild and ration though still resound
i wont let you in i want--

who in hell are you? yell usher suddenli sit up straight

i think the gentleman name is todd said the priest

then he pick up the pink slip of newspap

i fear you dont read the societi paper properli he said
and began to read out in a monoton voic `or lock in
the jewel bosom of our citi gayest leaders; but there is talk
of a pretti parodi of the manner and custom of the other end
of societi scale there been a big slum dinner up at
pilgrim pond tonight; and a man one of the guest disappear
mr ireton todd is a good host and ha track him here
without even wait to take off hi fancy-dress

what man do you mean?

i mean the man with comic ill-fit cloth you saw
run across the plough field hadnt you better go and
investig him? he will be rather impati to get back to hi champagn
from which he ran away in such a hurri when the convict with the gun
hove in sight

do you serious mean-- began the offici

whi look here mr usher said father brown quietli
you said the machin couldnt make a mistake; and in one sens it didnt
but the other machin did; the machin that work it
you assum that the man in rag jump at the name of lord falconroy
becaus he wa lord falconroy murder he jump at the name
of lord falconroy becaus he is lord falconroy

then whi the blaze didnt he say so? demand the stare usher

he felt hi plight and recent panic were hardli patrician
repli the priest so he tri to keep the name back at first
but he wa just go to tell it you when--and father brown look
down at hi boots--when a woman found anoth name for him

but you cant be so mad as to say said greywood usher
veri white that lord falconroy wa drugger davi

the priest look at him veri earnestli but with a baffl
and undecipher face

i am not say anyth about it he said i leav
all the rest to you your pink paper say that the titl
wa recent reviv for him; but those paper are veri unreli
it say he wa in the state in youth; but the whole stori seem
veri strang davi and falconroy are both pretti consider coward
but so are lot of other men i would not hang a dog on my own opinion
about thi but i think he went on softli and reflect
i think you american are too modest i think you ideal
the english aristocracy--even in assum it to be so aristocrat
you see a good-look englishman in evening-dress; you know
he in the hous of lords; and you fanci he ha a father
you dont allow for our nation buoyanc and uplift mani of our
most influenti noblemen have not onli risen recent but--

oh stop it! cri greywood usher wring one lean hand
in impati against a shade of ironi in the other face

dont stay talk to thi lunatic! cri todd brutal
take me to my friend

next morn father brown appear with the same demur express
carri yet anoth piec of pink newspap

im afraid you neglect the fashion press rather he said
but thi cut may interest you

usher read the headlin last-trick stray revellers:
mirth incid near pilgrim pond the paragraph went on:
a laughabl occurr took place outsid wilkinson motor garag
last night a policeman on duti had hi attent drawn by larrikin
to a man in prison dress who wa step with consider cool
into the steering-seat of a pretti high-ton panhard; he wa accompani
by a girl wrap in a rag shawl on the polic interf
the young woman threw back the shawl and all recogn
millionair todd daughter who had just come from the slum freak dinner
at the pond where all the choicest guest were in a similar deshabil
she and the gentleman who had don prison uniform were go for
the customari joy-rid

under the pink slip mr usher found a strip of a later paper
head astound escap of millionair daughter with convict
she had arrang freak dinner now safe in--

mr greenwood usher lift hi eye but father brown wa gone

there is somewher in brompton or kensington an intermin avenu

but hail by the pilgrim almost with a shout there is a sort of mew
between two of the tall mansion a mere slit like the crack of a door
by comparison with the street but just larg enough to permit
a pigmi ale-hous or eating-hous still allow by the rich to their
stable-serv to stand in the angl there is someth cheeri in it
veri dingi and someth free and elfin in it veri insignific
at the feet of those grey stone giant it look like a light hous
of dwarf

anyon pass the place dure a certain autumn even
itself almost fairylik might have seen a hand pull asid
the red half-blind which (along with some larg white lettering)
half hid the interior from the street and a face peer out not unlik
a rather innoc goblin it wa in fact the face of one with
the harmless human name of brown formerli priest of cobhol in essex
and now work in london hi friend flambeau a semi-offici
investig wa sit opposit him make hi last note of a case
he had clear up in the neighbourhood they were sit at a small tabl
close up to the window when the priest pull the curtain back
and look out he wait till a stranger in the street had
pass the window to let the curtain fall into it place again
then hi round eye roll to the larg white letter on the window
abov hi head and then stray to the next tabl at which sat onli
a navvi with beer and chees and a young girl with red hair and
a glass of milk then (see hi friend put away the pocket-book)
he said softly:

if youv got ten minut i wish youd follow that man with
the fals nose

flambeau look up in surprise; but the girl with the red hair
also look up and with someth that wa stronger than astonish
she wa simpli and even loos dress in light brown sack stuff;
but she wa a ladi and even on a second glanc a rather needlessli
haughti one the man with the fals nose! repeat flambeau
who he?

i havent a notion answer father brown i want you
to find out; i ask it as a favour he went down there--and he jerk
hi thumb over hi shoulder in one of hi undistinguish gestures--
and cant have pass three lamp-post yet i onli want to know
the direct

flambeau gaze at hi friend for some time with an express
between perplex and amusement; and then rise from the table;
squeez hi huge form out of the littl door of the dwarf tavern
and melt into the twilight

father brown took a small book out of hi pocket and began
to read steadily; he betray no conscious of the fact that
the red-hair ladi had left her own tabl and sat down opposit him
at last she lean over and said in a low strong voice:
whi do you say that? how do you know it false?

he lift hi rather heavi eyelid which flutter in
consider embarrass then hi dubiou eye roam again to
the white letter on the glass front of the public-hous
the young woman eye follow hi and rest there also
but in pure puzzledom

no said father brown answer her thought it doesnt say
`sela like the thing in the psalms; i read it like that myself when
i wa wool-gath just now; it say `ale

well? inquir the stare young ladi what doe it matter
what it says?

hi rumin eye rove to the girl light canva sleev
round the wrist of which ran a veri slight thread of artist pattern
just enough to distinguish it from a working-dress of a common woman
and make it more like the working-dress of a ladi art-stud
he seem to find much food for thought in this; but hi repli wa
veri slow and hesit you see madam he said from outsid
the place looks--wel it is a perfectli decent place--but ladi
like you dont--dont gener think so they never go into such place
from choic except--

well? she repeat

except an unfortun few who dont go in to drink milk

you are a most singular person said the young ladi
what is your object in all this?

not to troubl you about it he repli veri gentli
onli to arm myself with knowledg enough to help you if ever
you freeli ask my help

but whi should i need help?

he continu hi dreami monologu you couldnt have come in
to see protege humbl friend that sort of thing or youd have
gone through into the parlourand you couldnt have come in becaus
you were ill or youd have spoken to the woman of the place
who obvious respectablebesid you dont look ill in that way
but onli unhappi thi street is the onli origin long lane
that ha no turning; and the hous on both side are shut up
i could onli suppos that youd seen somebodi come whom you didnt want
to meet; and found the public-hous wa the onli shelter in thi
wilder of stone i dont think i went beyond the licenc of
a stranger in glanc at the onli man who pass immedi after
and as i thought he look like the wrong sortand you look like
the right sort i held myself readi to help if he annoy you;
that is all as for my friend hell be back soon; and he certainli
cant find out anyth by stump down a road like thi
i didnt think he could

then whi did you send him out? she cri lean forward with
yet warmer curios she had the proud impetu face that goe
with reddish colour and a roman nose as it did in mari antoinett

he look at her steadili for the first time and said:
becaus i hope you would speak to me

she look back at him for some time with a heat face
in which there hung a red shadow of anger; then despit her anxieti
humour broke out of her eye and the corner of her mouth
and she answer almost grimly: well if your so keen on
my convers perhap youll answer my question after a paus
she added: i had the honour to ask you whi you thought the man nose
wa fals

the wax alway spot like that just a littl in thi weather
answer father brown with entir simplic

but it such a crook nose remonstr the red-hair girl

the priest smile in hi turn i dont say it the sort of nose
one would wear out of mere fopperi he admit thi man i think
wear it becaus hi real nose is so much nicer

but why? she insist

what is the nursery-rhyme? observ brown absent-mindedli
there wa a crook man and he went a crook mile that man
i fanci ha gone a veri crook road--bi follow hi nose

whi what he done? she demand rather shakili

i dont want to forc your confid by a hair said father brown
veri quietli but i think you could tell me more about that than
i can tell you

the girl sprang to her feet and stood quit quietli but with
clench hand like one about to stride away; then her hand
loosen slowli and she sat down again you are more of a mysteri
than all the other she said desper but i feel there might be
a heart in your mysteri

what we all dread most said the priest in a low voic
is a maze with no centr that is whi atheism is onli a nightmar
i will tell you everyth said the red-hair girl doggedli
except whi i am tell you; and that i dont know

she pick at the darn table-cloth and went on: you look as if
you knew what isnt snobberi as well as what is; and when i say that
our is a good old famili youll understand it is a necessari part of
the story; inde my chief danger is in my brother high-and-dri notion
nobless oblig and all that well my name is christabel carstairs;
and my father wa that colonel carstair youv probabl heard of
who made the famou carstair collect of roman coin
i could never describ my father to you; the nearest i can say is
that he wa veri like a roman coin himself he wa as handsom and
as genuin and as valuabl and as metal and as out-of-d
he wa prouder of hi collect than of hi coat-of-arms--
nobodi could say more than that hi extraordinari charact
came out most in hi will he had two son and one daughter
he quarrel with one son my brother gile and sent him
to australia on a small allow he then made a will leav
the carstair collect actual with a yet smaller allow
to my brother arthur he meant it as a reward as the highest honour
he could offer in acknowledg of arthur loyalti and rectitud
and the distinct he had alreadi gain in mathemat and econom
at cambridg he left me practic all hi pretti larg fortune;
and i am sure he meant it in contempt

arthur you may say might well complain of this; but arthur
is my father over again though he had some differ with my
father in earli youth no sooner had he taken over the collect
than he becam like a pagan priest dedic to a templ
he mix up these roman halfpenc with the honour of the carstair
famili in the same stiff idolatr way as hi father befor him
he act as if roman money must be guard by all the roman virtu
he took no pleasures; he spent noth on himself; he live for
the collect often he would not troubl to dress for hi simpl meals;
but patter about among the cord brown-pap parcel (which no one els
wa allow to touch) in an old brown dressing-gown with it rope
and tassel and hi pale thin refin face it made him look like
an old ascet monk everi now and then though he would appear
dress like a decidedli fashion gentleman; but that wa onli when
he went up to the london sale or shop to make an addit to
the carstair collect

now if youv known ani young peopl you wont be shock
if i say that i got into rather a low frame of mind with all this;
the frame of mind in which one begin to say that the ancient roman
were all veri well in their way im not like my brother arthur;
i cant help enjoy enjoy i got a lot of romanc and rubbish
where i got my red hair from the other side of the famili
poor gile wa the same; and i think the atmospher of coin
might count in excus for him; though he realli did wrong and nearli
went to prison but he didnt behav ani wors than i did;
as you shall hear

i come now to the silli part of the stori i think a man
as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin
to reliev the monotoni for an unruli girl of seventeen place in such
a posit but i am so rattl with more dread thing that i can
hardli read my own feeling; and dont know whether i despis it now
as a flirtat or bear it as a broken heart we live then at
a littl seasid watering-plac in south wale and a retir sea-captain
live a few door off had a son about five year older than myself
who had been a friend of gile befor he went to the coloni
hi name doe not affect my tale; but i tell you it wa philip hawker
becaus i am tell you everyth we use to go shrimp togeth
and said and thought we were in love with each other; at least
he certainli said he wa and i certainli thought i wa
if i tell you he had bronz curli hair and a falconish sort of face
bronz by the sea also it not for hi sake i assur you
but for the story; for it wa the caus of a veri curiou coincid

one summer afternoon when i had promis to go shrimp
along the sand with philip i wa wait rather impati
in the front drawing-room watch arthur handl some packet of coin
he had just purchas and slowli shunt them one or two at a time
into hi own dark studi and museum which wa at the back of the hous
as soon as i heard the heavi door close on him final i made a bolt
for my shrimping-net and tam-o-shant and wa just go to slip out
when i saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay
gleam on the long bench by the window it wa a bronz coin
and the colour combin with the exact curv of the roman nose
and someth in the veri lift of the long wiri neck made the head
of caesar on it the almost precis portrait of philip hawker
then i suddenli rememb gile tell philip of a coin that wa
like him and philip wish he had it perhap you can fanci the wild
foolish thought with which my head went round; i felt as if i had
had a gift from the fairi it seem to me that if i could onli
run away with thi and give it to philip like a wild sort of wedding-r
it would be a bond between us for ever; i felt a thousand such thing
at onc then there yawn under me like the pit the enorm
aw notion of what i wa doing; abov all the unbear thought
which wa like touch hot iron of what arthur would think of it
a carstair a thief; and a thief of the carstair treasure!
i believ my brother could see me burn like a witch for such a thing
but then the veri thought of such fanat cruelti heighten
my old hatr of hi dingi old antiquarian fussi and my long
for the youth and liberti that call to me from the sea
outsid wa strong sunlight with a wind; and a yellow head of some
broom or gors in the garden rap against the glass of the window
i thought of that live and grow gold call to me from all
the heath of the world--and then of that dead dull gold and bronz
and brass of my brother grow dustier and dustier as life went by
natur and the carstair collect had come to grip at last

natur is older than the carstair collect as i ran
down the street to the sea the coin clench tight in my fist
i felt all the roman empir on my back as well as the carstair pedigre
it wa not onli the old lion argent that wa roar in my ear
but all the eagl of the caesar seem flap and scream
in pursuit of me and yet my heart rose higher and higher like
a child kite until i came over the loos dri sand-hil and to
the flat wet sand where philip stood alreadi up to hi ankl
in the shallow shine water some hundr yard out to sea
there wa a great red sunset; and the long stretch of low water
hardli rise over the ankl for half a mile wa like a lake
of rubi flame it wa not till i had torn off my shoe and stock
and wade to where he stood which wa well away from the dri land
that i turn and look round we were quit alon in a circl
of sea-wat and wet sand and i gave him the head of caesar

at the veri instant i had a shock of fancy: that a man far away
on the sand-hil wa look at me intent i must have felt
immedi after that it wa a mere leap of unreason nerves;
for the man wa onli a dark dot in the distanc and i could onli just see
that he wa stand quit still and gaze with hi head a littl
on one side there wa no earthli logic evid that he wa
look at me; he might have been look at a ship or the sunset
or the sea-gul or at ani of the peopl who still stray here and there
on the shore between us nevertheless whatev my start sprang from
wa prophetic; for as i gaze he start walk briskli in a bee-lin
toward us across the wide wet sand as he drew nearer and nearer
i saw that he wa dark and beard and that hi eye were mark with
dark spectacl he wa dress poorli but respect in black
from the old black top hat on hi head to the solid black boot
on hi feet in spite of these he walk straight into the sea
without a flash of hesit and came on at me with the steadi
of a travel bullet

i cant tell you the sens of monstros and miracl i had
when he thu silent burst the barrier between land and water
it wa as if he had walk straight off a cliff and still march
steadili in mid-air it wa as if a hous had flown up into the sky
or a man head had fallen off he wa onli wet hi boots;
but he seem to be a demon disregard a law of natur if he had
hesit an instant at the water edg it would have been noth
as it wa he seem to look so much at me alon as not to notic the ocean
philip wa some yard away with hi back to me bend over hi net
the stranger came on till he stood within two yard of me the water
wash half-way up to hi knee then he said with a clearli modul
and rather minc articulation: `would it discommod you to contribut
elsewher a coin with a somewhat differ superscription?

with one except there wa noth defin abnorm about him
hi tint glass were not realli opaqu but of a blue kind common enough
nor were the eye behind them shifti but regard me steadili
hi dark beard wa not realli long or wild-- but he look rather hairi
becaus the beard began veri high up in hi face just under
the cheek-bon hi complexion wa neither sallow nor livid
but on the contrari rather clear and youthful; yet thi gave
a pink-and-whit wax look which somehow (i dont know why) rather
increas the horror the onli odditi one could fix wa that hi nose
which wa otherwis of a good shape wa just slightli turn sideway
at the tip; as if when it wa soft it had been tap on one side
with a toy hammer the thing wa hardli a deformity; yet i cannot
tell you what a live nightmar it wa to me as he stood there
in the sunset-stain water he affect me as some hellish sea-monst
just risen roar out of a sea like blood i dont know whi
a touch on the nose should affect my imagin so much
i think it seem as if he could move hi nose like a finger
and as if he had just that moment move it

`ani littl assist he continu with the same queer
priggish accent `that may obviat the necess of my commun
with the famili

then it rush over me that i wa be blackmail for
the theft of the bronz piece; and all my mere superstiti fear
and doubt were swallow up in one overpow practic question
how could he have found out? i had stolen the thing suddenli and on impulse;
i wa certainli alone; for i alway made sure of be unobserv
when i slip out to see philip in thi way i had not
to all appear been follow in the street; and if i had
they could not `x-ray the coin in my close hand the man stand
on the sand-hil could no more have seen what i gave philip than
shoot a fli in one eye like the man in the fairy-tal

`philip i cri helplessli `ask thi man what he want

when philip lift hi head at last from mend hi net
he look rather red as if sulki or ashamed; but it may have been
onli the exert of stoop and the red even light; i may have
onli had anoth of the morbid fanci that seem to be danc about me
he mere said gruffli to the man: `you clear out of thi
and motion me to follow set off wade shoreward without pay
further attent to him he step on to a stone breakwat that
ran out from among the root of the sand-hil and so struck homeward
perhap think our incubu would find it less easi to walk on such
rough stone green and slipperi with seawe than we who were young
and use to it but my persecutor walk as daintili as he talked;
and he still follow me pick hi way and pick hi phrase
i heard hi delic detest voic appeal to me over my shoulder
until at last when we had crest the sand-hil philip patienc
(which wa by no mean so conspicu on most occasions) seem to snap
he turn suddenli say `go back i cant talk to you now
and as the man hover and open hi mouth philip struck him a buffet
on it that sent him fli from the top of the tallest sand-hil
to the bottom i saw him crawl out below cover with sand

thi stroke comfort me somehow though it might well increas
my peril; but philip show none of hi usual elat at hi own prowess
though as affection as ever he still seem cast down; and befor
i could ask him anyth fulli he part with me at hi own gate
with two remark that struck me as strang he said that
all thing consid i ought to put the coin back in the collection;
but that he himself would keep it `for the present and then he ad
quit suddenli and irrelevantly: `you know gile is back from australia?

the door of the tavern open and the gigant shadow of
the investig flambeau fell across the tabl father brown
present him to the ladi in hi own slight persuas style of speech
mention hi knowledg and sympathi in such cases; and almost
without know the girl wa soon reiter her stori to two listen
but flambeau as he bow and sat down hand the priest a small slip
of paper brown accept it with some surpris and read on it:
cab to wagga wagga 379 mafek avenu putney the girl wa go
on with her stori

i went up the steep street to my own hous with my head in a whirl;
it had not begun to clear when i came to the doorstep on which
i found a milk-can--and the man with the twist nose the milk-can
told me the servant were all out; for of cours arthur
brows about in hi brown dressing-gown in a brown studi
would not hear or answer a bell thu there wa no one to help me
in the hous except my brother whose help must be my ruin
in desper i thrust two shill into the horrid thing hand
and told him to call again in a few day when i had thought it out
he went off sulk but more sheepishli than i had expected--
perhap he had been shaken by hi fall--and i watch the star of sand
splash on hi back reced down the road with a horrid vindict
pleasur he turn a corner some six hous down

then i let myself in made myself some tea and tri to
think it out i sat at the drawing-room window look on to the garden
which still glow with the last full even light but i wa too
distract and dreami to look at the lawn and flower-pot and flower-b
with ani concentr so i took the shock the more sharpli becaus
id seen it so slowli

the man or monster id sent away wa stand quit still
in the middl of the garden oh weve all read a lot about
pale-fac phantom in the dark; but thi wa more dread
than anyth of that kind could ever be becaus though he cast
a long even shadow he still stood in warm sunlight and becaus
hi face wa not pale but had that waxen bloom still upon it
that belong to a barber dummi he stood quit still with hi face
toward me; and i cant tell you how horrid he look among the tulip
and all those tall gaudi almost hothouse-look flower
it look as if wed stuck up a waxwork instead of a statu in
the centr of our garden

yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turn
and ran out of the garden by the back gate which stood open and
by which he had undoubtedli enter thi renew timid on hi part
wa so differ from the impud with which he had walk into the sea
that i felt vagu comfort i fanci perhap that he fear
confront arthur more than i knew anyhow i settl down at last
and had a quiet dinner alon (for it wa against the rule to
disturb arthur when he wa rearrang the museum) and my thought
a littl releas fled to philip and lost themselv i suppos
anyhow i wa look blankli but rather pleasantli than otherwis
at anoth window uncurtain but by thi time black as a slate
with the final night-fal it seem to me that someth like a snail
wa on the outsid of the window-pan but when i stare harder
it wa more like a man thumb press on the pane; it had that curl look
that a thumb ha with my fear and courag re-awaken togeth
i rush at the window and then recoil with a strangl scream
that ani man but arthur must have heard

for it wa not a thumb ani more than it wa a snail
it wa the tip of a crook nose crush against the glass;
it look white with the pressure; and the stare face and eye
behind it were at first invis and afterward grey like a ghost
i slam the shutter togeth somehow rush up to my room and
lock myself in but even as i pass i could swear i saw
a second black window with someth on it that wa like a snail

it might be best to go to arthur after all if the thing
wa crawl close all around the hous like a cat it might have
purpos wors even than blackmail my brother might cast me out
and curs me for ever but he wa a gentleman and would defend me
on the spot after ten minut curiou think i went down
knock on the door and then went in: to see the last and worst sight

my brother chair wa empti and he wa obvious out
but the man with the crook nose wa sit wait for hi return
with hi hat still insol on hi head and actual read
one of my brother book under my brother lamp hi face wa compos
and occupi but hi nose-tip still had the air of be the most mobil
part of hi face as if it had just turn from left to right like
an eleph probosci i had thought him poison enough while
he wa pursu and watch me; but i think hi unconsci
of my presenc wa more fright still

i think i scream loud and long; but that doesnt matter
what i did next doe matter: i gave him all the money i had
includ a good deal in paper which though it wa mine i dare say
i had no right to touch he went off at last with hate
tact regret all in long words; and i sat down feel ruin
in everi sens and yet i wa save that veri night by a pure accid
arthur had gone off suddenli to london as he so often did for bargains;
and return late but radiant have nearli secur a treasur
that wa an ad splendour even to the famili collect
he wa so resplend that i wa almost embolden to confess
the abstract of the lesser gem-- but he bore down all other topic
with hi over-pow project becaus the bargain might still
misfir ani moment he insist on my pack at onc and go up
with him to lodg he had alreadi taken in fulham to be near
the curio-shop in question thu in spite of myself i fled from my foe
almost in the dead of night--but from philip also my brother
wa often at the south kensington museum and in order to make
some sort of secondari life for myself i paid for a few lesson
at the art school i wa come back from them thi even
when i saw the abomin of desol walk aliv down
the long straight street and the rest is as thi gentleman ha said

ive got onli one thing to say i dont deserv to be helped;
and i dont question or complain of my punishment; it is just
it ought to have happen but i still question with burst brain
how it can have happen am i punish by miracle? or how can anyon but
philip and myself know i gave him a tini coin in the middl of the sea?

it is an extraordinari problem admit flambeau

not so extraordinari as the answer remark father brown
rather gloomili miss carstair will you be at home if we call
at your fulham place in an hour and a half hence?

the girl look at him and then rose and put her glove on
ye she said ill be there; and almost instantli left the place

that night the detect and the priest were still talk
of the matter as they drew near the fulham hous a tenement
strang mean even for a temporari resid of the carstair famili

of cours the superfici on reflect said flambeau
would think first of thi australian brother who been
in troubl befor who come back so suddenli and who just the man
to have shabbi confeder but i cant see how he can
come into the thing by ani process of thought unless

well? ask hi companion patient

flambeau lower hi voic unless the girl lover come in
too and he would be the blacker villain the australian chap
did know that hawker want the coin but i cant see how on earth
he could know that hawker had got it unless hawker signal to him
or hi repres across the shore

that is true assent the priest with respect

have you note anoth thing? went on flambeau eagerli
thi hawker hear hi love insult but doesnt strike till he got
to the soft sand-hil where he can be victor in a mere sham-fight
if hed struck amid rock and sea he might have hurt hi alli

that is true again said father brown nod

and now take it from the start it lie between few peopl
but at least three you want one person for suicide; two peopl
for murder; but at least three peopl for blackmail

why? ask the priest softli

well obvious cri hi friend there must be one to be exposed;
one to threaten exposure; and one at least whom exposur would horrifi

after a long rumin paus the priest said: you miss a logic step
three person are need as idea onli two are need as agent

what can you mean? ask the other

whi shouldnt a blackmail ask brown in a low voic
threaten hi victim with himself? suppos a wife becam
a rigid teetotal in order to frighten her husband into conceal
hi pub-frequ and then wrote him blackmail letter
in anoth hand threaten to tell hi wife! whi shouldnt it work?
suppos a father forbad a son to gambl and then follow him
in a good disguis threaten the boy with hi own sham
patern strictness! suppose--but here we are my friend

my god! cri flambeau; you dont mean--

an activ figur ran down the step of the hous and show
under the golden lamplight the unmistak head that resembl
the roman coin miss carstair said hawker without ceremoni
wouldnt go in till you came

well observ brown confid dont you think it
the best thing she can do to stop outside--with you to look after her?
you see i rather guess you have guess it all yourself

ye said the young man in an underton i guess
on the sand and now i know; that wa whi i let him fall soft

take a latchkey from the girl and the coin from hawker
flambeau let himself and hi friend into the empti hous and pass
into the outer parlour it wa empti of all occup but one
the man whom father brown had seen pass the tavern wa stand
against the wall as if at bay; unchang save that he had taken off
hi black coat and wa wear a brown dressing-gown

we have come said father brown polit to give back
thi coin to it owner and he hand it to the man with the nose

flambeau eye roll is thi man a coin-collector? he ask

thi man is mr arthur carstair said the priest posit
and he is a coin-collector of a somewhat singular kind

the man chang colour so horribl that the crook nose
stood out on hi face like a separ and comic thing he spoke
nevertheless with a sort of despair digniti you shall see
then he said that i have not lost all the famili qualiti
and he turn suddenli and strode into an inner room slam the door

stop him! shout father brown bound and half fall
over a chair; and after a wrench or two flambeau had the door open
but it wa too late in dead silenc flambeau strode across
and telephon for doctor and polic

an empti medicin bottl lay on the floor across the tabl
the bodi of the man in the brown dressing-gown lay amid hi burst
and gape brown-pap parcels; out of which pour and roll
not roman but veri modern english coin

the priest held up the bronz head of caesar thi he said
wa all that wa left of the carstair collect

after a silenc he went on with more than common gentleness:
it wa a cruel will hi wick father made and you see he did
resent it a littl he hate the roman money he had and grew fonder
of the real money deni him he not onli sold the collect
bit by bit but sank bit by bit to the basest way of make money--
even to blackmail hi own famili in a disguis he blackmail
hi brother from australia for hi littl forgotten crime (that is whi
he took the cab to wagga wagga in putney) he blackmail hi sister
for the theft he alon could have notic and that by the way
is whi she had that supernatur guess when he wa away on the sand-dun
mere figur and gait howev distant are more like to remind us
of somebodi than a well-made-up face quit close

there wa anoth silenc well growl the detect
and so thi great numismatist and coin-collector wa noth but
a vulgar miser

is there so great a difference? ask father brown in the same
strang indulg tone what is there wrong about a miser that is
not often as wrong about a collector? what is wrong except
thou shalt not make to thyself ani graven image; thou shalt not
bow down to them nor serv them for ibut we must go and see how
the poor young peopl are get on

i think said flambeau that in spite of everyth
they are probabl get on veri well




vii the purpl wig


mr edward nutt the industri editor of the daili reform
sat at hi desk open letter and mark proof to the merri tune
of a typewrit work by a vigor young ladi

he wa a stoutish fair man in hi shirt-sleeves; hi movement
were resolut hi mouth firm and hi tone final; but hi round
rather babyish blue eye had a bewild and even wist look
that rather contradict all thi nor inde wa the express
altogeth mislead it might truli be said of him as for mani
journalist in author that hi most familiar emot wa one of
continu fear; fear of libel action fear of lost advertis
fear of misprint fear of the sack

hi life wa a seri of distract compromis between
the proprietor of the paper (and of him) who wa a senil soap-boil
with three ineradic mistak in hi mind and the veri abl staff
he had collect to run the paper; some of whom were brilliant
and experienc men and (what wa even worse) sincer enthusiast
for the polit polici of the paper

a letter from one of these lay immedi befor him
and rapid and resolut as he wa he seem almost to hesit
befor open it he took up a strip of proof instead ran down it
with a blue eye and a blue pencil alter the word adulteri
to the word improprieti and the word jew to the word alien
rang a bell and sent it fli upstair

then with a more thought eye he rip open the letter from hi
more distinguish contributor which bore a postmark of devonshir
and read as follows:

dear nutt--a i see your work spook and dook at the same time
what about an articl on that rum busi of the eyr of exmoor;
or as the old women call it down here the devil ear of eyre?
the head of the famili you know is the duke of exmoor; he is one of
the few realli stiff old tori aristocrat left a sound old crust tyrant
it is quit in our line to make troubl about and i think im
on the track of a stori that will make troubl

of cours i dont believ in the old legend about jame i;
and as for you you dont believ in anyth not even in journal
the legend youll probabl rememb wa about the blackest busi
in english history--th poison of overburi by that witch cat
franc howard and the quit mysteri terror which forc the king
to pardon the murder there wa a lot of alleg witchcraft
mix up with it; and the stori goe that a man-serv listen
at the keyhol heard the truth in a talk between the king and carr;
and the bodili ear with which he heard grew larg and monstrou
as by magic so aw wa the secret and though he had to be load
with land and gold and made an ancestor of duke the elf-shap ear
is still recurr in the famili well you dont believ in black magic;
and if you did you couldnt use it for copi if a miracl happen
in your offic youd have to hush it up now so mani bishop
are agnost but that is not the point the point is that
there realli is someth queer about exmoor and hi family;
someth quit natur i dare say but quit abnorm
and the ear is in it somehow i fancy; either a symbol or a delus
or diseas or someth anoth tradit say that cavali
just after jame i began to wear their hair long onli to cover
the ear of the first lord exmoor thi also is no doubt fanci

the reason i point it out to you is this: it seem to me that
we make a mistak in attack aristocraci entir for it champagn
and diamond most men rather admir the nob for have a good time
but i think we surrend too much when we admit that aristocraci
ha made even the aristocrat happi i suggest a seri of articl
point out how dreari how inhuman how downright diabolist
is the veri smell and atmospher of some of these great hous
there are plenti of instances; but you couldnt begin with a better one
than the ear of the eyr by the end of the week i think i can
get you the truth about it--your ever franci finn

mr nutt reflect a moment stare at hi left boot;
then he call out in a strong loud and entir lifeless voic
in which everi syllabl sound alike: miss barlow take down
a letter to mr finn pleas

dear finn--i think it would do; copi should reach us second post
saturday--your e nutt

thi elabor epistl he articul as if it were all one word;
and miss barlow rattl it down as if it were all one word
then he took up anoth strip of proof and a blue pencil
and alter the word supernatur to the word marvel
and the express shoot down to the express repress

in such happi health activ did mr nutt disport himself
until the ensu saturday found him at the same desk dictat to
the same typist and use the same blue pencil on the first instal
of mr finn revel the open wa a sound piec of slash
invect about the evil secret of princ and despair in the high place
of the earth though written violent it wa in excel english;
but the editor as usual had given to somebodi els the task
of break it up into sub-head which were of a spicier sort
as peeress and poison and the eeri ear the eyr in their eyri
and so on through a hundr happi chang then follow the legend
of the ear amplifi from finn first letter and then the substanc
of hi later discoveri as follows:


i know it is the practic of journalist to put the end of the stori
at the begin and call it a headlin i know that journal
larg consist in say lord jone dead to peopl who never knew
that lord jone wa aliv your present correspond think that thi
like mani other journalist custom is bad journalism; and that
the daili reform ha to set a better exampl in such thing
he propos to tell hi stori as it occur step by step
he will use the real name of the parti who in most case are readi
to confirm hi testimoni as for the headlin the sensat
proclamations--they will come at the end

i wa walk along a public path that thread through
a privat devonshir orchard and seem to point toward devonshir cider
when i came suddenli upon just such a place as the path suggest
it wa a long low inn consist realli of a cottag and two barns;
thatch all over with the thatch that look like brown and grey hair
grown befor histori but outsid the door wa a sign which
call it the blue dragon; and under the sign wa one of those long
rustic tabl that use to stand outsid most of the free english inn
befor teetotal and brewer between them destroy freedom
and at thi tabl sat three gentlemen who might have live
a hundr year ago

now that i know them all better there is no difficulti
about disentangl the impressions; but just then they look like
three veri solid ghost the domin figur both becaus he wa
bigger in all three dimens and becaus he sat central
in the length of the tabl face me wa a tall fat man dress
complet in black with a rubicund even apoplect visag
but a rather bald and rather bother brow look at him again
more strictli i could not exactli say what it wa that gave me
the sens of antiqu except the antiqu cut of hi white
cleric neckti and the bar wrinkl across hi brow

it wa even less easi to fix the impress in the case of
the man at the right end of the tabl who to say truth
wa as commonplac a person as could be seen anywher with a round
brown-hair head and a round snub nose but also clad in cleric black
of a stricter cut it wa onli when i saw hi broad curv hat lie
on the tabl besid him that i realiz whi i connect him with
anyth ancient he wa a roman cathol priest

perhap the third man at the other end of the tabl
had realli more to do with it than the rest though he wa both
slighter in physic presenc and more inconsider in hi dress
hi lank limb were clad i might also say clutch in veri tight
grey sleev and pantaloons; he had a long sallow aquilin face
which seem somehow all the more saturnin becaus hi lantern jaw
were imprison in hi collar and neck-cloth more in the style of
the old stock; and hi hair (which ought to have been dark brown)
wa of an odd dim russet colour which in conjunct with
hi yellow face look rather purpl than red the unobtrus
yet unusu colour wa all the more notabl becaus hi hair wa
almost unnatur healthi and curl and he wore it full
but after all analysi i inclin to think that what gave me
my first old-fashion impress wa simpli a set of tall
old-fashion wine-glass one or two lemon and two churchwarden pipe
and also perhap the old-world errand on which i had come

be a harden report and it be appar a public inn
i did not need to summon much of my impud to sit down at
the long tabl and order some cider the big man in black seem
veri learn especi about local antiquities; the small man in black
though he talk much less surpris me with a yet wider cultur
so we got on veri well together; but the third man the old gentleman
in the tight pantaloon seem rather distant and haughti
until i slid into the subject of the duke of exmoor and hi ancestri

i thought the subject seem to embarrass the other two a little;
but it broke the spell of the third man silenc most success
speak with restraint and with the accent of a highli educ gentleman
and puf at interv at hi long churchwarden pipe he proceed
to tell me some of the most horribl stori i have ever heard in my life:
how one of the eyr in the former age had hang hi own father;
and anoth had hi wife scourg at the cart tail through the village;
and anoth had set fire to a church full of children and so on

some of the tale inde are not fit for public print--
such as the stori of the scarlet nun the abomin stori of
the spot dog or the thing that wa done in the quarri
and all thi red roll of impieti came from hi thin genteel lip
rather primli than otherwis as he sat sip the wine out of
hi tall thin glass

i could see that the big man opposit me wa tri
if anyth to stop him; but he evid held the old gentleman
in consider respect and could not ventur to do so at all abruptli
and the littl priest at the other end of the-tabl though free from
ani such air of embarrass look steadili at the tabl
and seem to listen to the recit with great pain--a well as he might

you dont seem i said to the narrat to be veri fond of
the exmoor pedigre

he look at me a moment hi lip still prim but whiten
and tightening; then he deliber broke hi long pipe and glass
on the tabl and stood up the veri pictur of a perfect gentleman
with the frame temper of a fiend

these gentlemen he said will tell you whether i have caus
to like it the curs of the eyr of old ha lain heavi on thi countri
and mani have suffer from it they know there are none who have
suffer from it as i have and with that he crush a piec of
the fallen glass under hi heel and strode away among the green twilight
of the twinkl apple-tre

that is an extraordinari old gentleman i said to the other two;
do you happen to know what the exmoor famili ha done to him? who is he?

the big man in black wa stare at me with the wild air of
a baffl bull; he did not at first seem to take it in then he said
at last dont you know who he is?

i reaffirm my ignor and there wa anoth silence;
then the littl priest said still look at the tabl that is
the duke of exmoor

then befor i could collect my scatter sens he ad
equal quietli but with an air of regular things:
my friend here is doctor mull the duke librarian my name is brown

but i stammer if that is the duke whi doe he damn all
the old duke like that?

he seem realli to believ answer the priest call brown
that they have left a curs on him then he ad with some irrelev
that whi he wear a wig

it wa a few moment befor hi mean dawn on me
you dont mean that fabl about the fantast ear? i demand
ive heard of it of cours but sure it must be a superstiti yarn
spun out of someth much simpler ive sometim thought it wa
a wild version of one of those mutil stori they use to crop
crimin ear in the sixteenth centuri

i hardli think it wa that answer the littl man thought
but it is not outsid ordinari scienc or natur law for a famili
to have some deform frequent reappearing--such as one ear bigger
than the other

the big librarian had buri hi big bald brow in hi big red hand
like a man tri to think out hi duti no he groan
you do the man a wrong after all understand ive no reason
to defend him or even keep faith with him he ha been a tyrant to me
as to everybodi els dont fanci becaus you see him sit here
that he isnt a great lord in the worst sens of the word
he would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off--if it would
summon anoth man three mile to fetch a matchbox three yard off
he must have a footman to carri hi walking-stick; a bodi servant
to hold up hi opera-glasses--

but not a valet to brush hi cloth cut in the priest
with a curiou dryness for the valet would want to brush hi wig too

the librarian turn to him and seem to forget my presence;
he wa strongli move and i think a littl heat with wine
i dont know how you know it father brown he said but you are right
he let the whole world do everyth for him--except dress him
and that he insist on do in a liter solitud like a desert
anybodi is kick out of the hous without a charact who is
so much as found near hi dressing-room door

he seem a pleasant old parti i remark

no repli dr mull quit simply; and yet that is just what
i mean by say you are unjust to him after all gentlemen the duke
doe realli feel the bitter about the curs that he utter just now
he doe with sincer shame and terror hide under that purpl wig
someth he think it would blast the son of man to see
i know it is so; and i know it is not a mere natur disfigur
like a crimin mutil or a hereditari disproport in the featur
i know it is wors than that; becaus a man told me who wa present
at a scene that no man could invent where a stronger man than
ani of us tri to defi the secret and wa scare away from it

i open my mouth to speak but mull went on in oblivion of me
speak out of the cavern of hi hand i dont mind tell you
father becaus it realli more defend the poor duke than
give him away didnt you ever hear of the time when he
veri nearli lost all the estates?

the priest shook hi head; and the librarian proceed to
tell the tale as he had heard it from hi predecessor in the same post
who had been hi patron and instructor and whom he seem to trust
implicitli up to a certain point it wa a common enough tale
of the declin of a great famili fortunes--th tale of a famili lawyer
hi lawyer howev had the sens to cheat honestli if the express
explain itself instead of use fund he held in trust
he took advantag of the duke careless to put the famili in
a financi hole in which it might be necessari for the duke to
let him hold them in realiti

the lawyer name wa isaac green but the duke alway call him
elisha; presum in refer to the fact that he wa quit bald
though certainli not more than thirti he had risen veri rapidli
but from veri dirti beginnings; be first a nark or inform
and then a money-lender: but as solicitor to the eyr he had the sens
as i say to keep technic straight until he wa readi to deal
the final blow the blow fell at dinner; and the old librarian said
he should never forget the veri look of the lampshad and the decant
as the littl lawyer with a steadi smile propos to the great landlord
that they should halv the estat between them the sequel certainli
could not be overlooked; for the duke in dead silenc smash
a decant on the man bald head as suddenli as i had seen him smash
the glass that day in the orchard it left a red triangular scar
on the scalp and the lawyer eye alter but not hi smile

he rose totter to hi feet and struck back as such men do strike
i am glad of that he said for now i can take the whole estat
the law will give it to me

exmoor it seem wa white as ash but hi eye still blaze
the law will give it you he said; but you will not take it
whi not? why? becaus it would mean the crack of doom for me
and if you take it i shall take off my wig whi you piti
pluck fowl anyon can see your bare head but no man shall
see mine and live

well you may say what you like and make it mean what you like
but mull swear it is the solemn fact that the lawyer after shake
hi knot fist in the air for an instant simpli ran from the room
and never reappear in the countryside; and sinc then exmoor ha been
fear more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistr

now dr mull told hi stori with rather wild theatric gestur
and with a passion i think at least partisan i wa quit consciou
of the possibl that the whole wa the extravag of
an old braggart and gossip but befor i end thi half of my discoveri
i think it due to dr mull to record that my two first inquiri
have confirm hi stori i learn from an old apothecari in the villag
that there wa a bald man in even dress give the name of green
who came to him one night to have a three-corn cut on hi forehead
plaster and i learnt from the legal record and old newspap
that there wa a lawsuit threaten and at least begun by one green
against the duke of exmoor


mr nutt of the daili reform wrote some highli incongru
word across the top of the copi made some highli mysteri mark
down the side of it and call to miss barlow in the same loud
monoton voice: take down a letter to mr finn

dear finn--your copi will do but i have had to headlin it a bit;
and our public would never stand a romanist priest in the story--
you must keep your eye on the suburb ive alter him to mr brown
a spiritualist

your

e nutt


a day or two afterward found the activ and judici editor
examin with blue eye that seem to grow rounder and rounder
the second instal of mr finn tale of mysteri in high life
it began with the words:


i have made an astound discoveri i freeli confess it is
quit differ from anyth i expect to discov and will give
a much more practic shock to the public i ventur to say
without ani vaniti that the word i now write will be read all over europ
and certainli all over america and the coloni and yet i heard
all i have to tell befor i left thi same littl wooden tabl in thi
same littl wood of apple-tre

i owe it all to the small priest brown; he is an extraordinari man
the big librarian had left the tabl perhap asham of hi long tongu
perhap anxiou about the storm in which hi mysteri master
had vanished: anyway he betook himself heavili in the duke track
through the tree father brown had pick up one of the lemon and
wa eye it with an odd pleasur

what a love colour a lemon is! he said there one thing
i dont like about the duke wig--th colour

i dont think i understand i answer

i dare say he got good reason to cover hi ear like king mida
went on the priest with a cheer simplic which somehow seem
rather flippant under the circumst i can quit understand
that it nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plate or
leather flap but if he want to use hair whi doesnt he make it
look like hair? there never wa hair of that colour in thi world
it look more like a sunset-cloud come through the wood
whi doesnt he conceal the famili curs better if he realli
so asham of it? shall i tell you? it becaus he isnt asham of it
he proud of it

it an ugli wig to be proud of--and an ugli stori i said

consid repli thi curiou littl man how you yourself
realli feel about such thing i dont suggest your either
more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us: but dont you feel
in a vagu way that a genuin old famili curs is rather a fine thing
to have? would you be asham wouldnt you be a littl proud
if the heir of the glami horror call you hi friend? or if byron
famili had confid to you onli the evil adventur of their race?
dont be too hard on the aristocrat themselv if their head are
as weak as our would be and they are snob about their own sorrow

by jove! i cried; and that true enough my own mother famili
had a banshee; and now i come to think of it it ha comfort me
in mani a cold hour

and think he went on of that stream of blood and poison
that spurt from hi thin lip the instant you so much as mention
hi ancestor whi should he show everi stranger over such
a chamber of horror unless he is proud of it? he doesnt conceal hi wig
he doesnt conceal hi blood he doesnt conceal hi famili curs
he doesnt conceal the famili crimes--but--

the littl man voic chang so suddenli he shut hi hand
so sharpli and hi eye so rapidli grew rounder and brighter
like a wake owl that it had all the abrupt of a small explos
on the tabl

but he end he doe realli conceal hi toilet

it somehow complet the thrill of my fanci nerv that
at that instant the duke appear again silent among the glimmer tree
with hi soft foot and sunset-hu hair come round the corner of
the hous in compani with hi librarian befor he came within earshot
father brown had ad quit composedli whi doe he realli hide
the secret of what he doe with the purpl wig? becaus it isnt
the sort of secret we suppos

the duke came round the corner and resum hi seat at the head
of the tabl with all hi nativ digniti the embarrass of
the librarian left him hover on hi hind leg like a huge bear
the duke address the priest with great serious father brown
he said doctor mull inform me that you have come here to make a request
i no longer profess an observ of the religion of my fathers;
but for their sake and for the sake of the day when we met befor
i am veri will to hear you but i presum you would rather
be heard in privat

whatev i retain of the gentleman made me stand up
whatev i have attain of the journalist made me stand still
befor thi paralysi could pass the priest had made a momentarili
detain motion if he said your grace will permit me
my real petit or if i retain ani right to advis you i would urg
that as mani peopl as possibl should be present all over thi countri
i have found hundr even of my own faith and flock whose imagin
are poison by the spell which i implor you to break i wish we could
have all devonshir here to see you do it

to see me do what? ask the duke arch hi eyebrow

to see you take off your wig said father brown

the duke face did not move; but he look at hi petition
with a glassi stare which wa the most aw express i have ever seen
on a human face i could see the librarian great leg waver
under him like the shadow of stem in a pool; and i could not banish
from my own brain the fanci that the tree all around us were
fill softli in the silenc with devil instead of bird

i spare you said the duke in a voic of inhuman piti
i refus if i gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror
i have to bear alon you would lie shriek at these feet of mine
and beg to know no more i will spare you the hint
you shall not spell the first letter of what is written on
the altar of the unknown god

i know the unknown god said the littl priest with an
unconsci grandeur of certitud that stood up like a granit tower
i know hi name; it is satan the true god wa made flesh
and dwelt among us and i say to you wherev you find men rule
mere by mysteri it is the mysteri of iniqu if the devil
tell you someth is too fear to look at look at it
if he say someth is too terribl to hear hear it if you think
some truth unbear bear it i entreat your grace to end
thi nightmar now and here at thi tabl

if i did said the duke in a low voic you and all you believ
and all by which alon you live would be the first to shrivel and perish
you would have an instant to know the great noth befor you die

the cross of christ be between me and harm said father brown
take off your wig

i wa lean over the tabl in ungovern excitement;
in listen to thi extraordinari duel half a thought had
come into my head your grace i cri i call your bluff
take off that wig or i will knock it off

i suppos i can be prosecut for assault but i am veri glad
i did it when he said in the same voic of stone i refus
i simpli sprang on him for three long instant he strain against me
as if he had all hell to help him; but i forc hi head until
the hairi cap fell off it i admit that whilst wrestl
i shut my eye as it fell

i wa awaken by a cri from mull who wa also by thi time
at the duke side hi head and mine were both bend over
the bald head of the wigless duke then the silenc wa snap
by the librarian exclaiming: what can it mean? whi the man had
noth to hide hi ear are just like everybodi els

ye said father brown that is what he had to hide

the priest walk straight up to him but strang enough
did not even glanc at hi ear he stare with an almost comic
serious at hi bald forehead and point to a three-corn
cicatric long heal but still discern mr green i think
he said polit and he did get the whole estat after all

and now let me tell the reader of the daili reform
what i think the most remark thing in the whole affair
thi transform scene which will seem to you as wild and purpl
as a persian fairy-tal ha been (except for my technic assault)
strictli legal and constitut from it first begin
thi man with the odd scar and the ordinari ear is not an impostor
though (in one sense) he wear anoth man wig and claim
anoth man ear he ha not stolen anoth man coronet
he realli is the one and onli duke of exmoor what happen wa thi
the old duke realli had a slight malform of the ear which realli
wa more or less hereditari he realli wa morbid about it;
and it is like enough that he did invok it as a kind of curs
in the violent scene (which undoubtedli happened) in which he struck
green with the decant but the contest end veri differ
green press hi claim and got the estates; the dispossess nobleman
shot himself and die without issu after a decent interv
the beauti english govern reviv the extinct peerag of exmoor
and bestow it as is usual on the most import person
the person who had got the properti

thi man use the old feudal fables--properli in hi snobbish soul
realli envi and admir them so that thousand of poor english peopl
trembl befor a mysteri chieftain with an ancient destini and
a diadem of evil stars--when they are realli trembl befor
a guttersnip who wa a pettifogg and a pawnbrok not twelv year ago
i think it veri typic of the real case against our aristocraci as it is
and as it will be till god send us braver men


mr nutt put down the manuscript and call out with unusu
sharpness: miss barlow pleas take down a letter to mr finn

dear finn--you must be mad; we cant touch thi i want vampir
and the bad old day and aristocraci hand-in-hand with superstit
they like that but you must know the exmoor would never forgiv thi
and what would our peopl say then i should like to know! whi sir simon
is one of exmoor greatest pals; and it would ruin that cousin of
the eyr that stand for us at bradford besid old soap-sud
wa sick enough at not get hi peerag last year; hed sack me by wire
if i lost him it with such lunaci as thi and what about duffey?
he do us some rattl articl on the heel of the norman
and how can he write about norman if the man onli a solicitor?
do be reasonable--your e nutt

as miss barlow rattl away cheer he crumpl up the copi
and toss it into the waste-pap basket; but not befor he had
automat and by forc of habit alter the word god
to the word circumst



viii the perish of the pendragon


father brown wa in no mood for adventur he had late fallen ill
with over-work and when he began to recov hi friend flambeau
had taken him on a cruis in a small yacht with sir cecil fanshaw
a young cornish squir and an enthusiast for cornish coast sceneri
but brown wa still rather weak; he wa no veri happi sailor;
and though he wa never of the sort that either grumbl or break down
hi spirit did not rise abov patienc and civil when the other
two men prais the rag violet sunset or the rag volcan crag
he agre with them when flambeau point out a rock shape
like a dragon he look at it and thought it veri like a dragon
when fanshaw more excitedli indic a rock that wa like merlin
he look at it and signifi assent when flambeau ask whether
thi rocki gate of the twist river wa not the gate of fairyland
he said ye he heard the most import thing and the most trivial
with the same tasteless absorpt he heard that the coast wa death
to all but care seamen; he also heard that the ship cat wa asleep
he heard that fanshaw couldnt find hi cigar-hold anywhere;
he also heard the pilot deliv the oracl both eye bright
she all right; one eye wink down she sink he heard flambeau
say to fanshaw that no doubt thi meant the pilot must keep both eye
open and be spri and he heard fanshaw say to flambeau that
oddli enough it didnt mean this: it meant that while they
saw two of the coast light one near and the other distant
exactli side by side they were in the right river-channel;
but that if one light wa hidden behind the other they were go
on the rock he heard fanshaw add that hi countri wa full of
such quaint fabl and idioms; it wa the veri home of romance;
he even pit thi part of cornwal against devonshir as a claimant
to the laurel of elizabethan seamanship accord to him
there had been captain among these cove and islet compar with whom
drake wa practic a landsman he heard flambeau laugh and ask if
perhap the adventur titl of westward ho! onli meant that
all devonshir men wish they were live in cornwal he heard fanshaw
say there wa no need to be silly; that not onli had cornish captain
been hero but that they were hero still: that near that veri spot
there wa an old admir now retir who wa scar by thrill voyag
full of adventures; and who had in hi youth found the last group
of eight pacif island that wa ad to the chart of the world
thi cecil fanshaw wa in person of the kind that commonli urg
such crude but pleas enthusiasms; a veri young man light-hair
high-colour with an eager profile; with a boyish bravado of spirit
but an almost girlish delicaci of tint and type the big shoulder
black brow and black mousquetair swagger of flambeau
were a great contrast

all these trivial brown heard and saw; but heard them
as a tire man hear a tune in the railway wheel or saw them
as a sick man see the pattern of hi wall-pap no one can calcul
the turn of mood in convalescence: but father brown depress
must have had a great deal to do with hi mere unfamiliar with the sea
for as the river mouth narrow like the neck of a bottl
and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthli
he seem to wake up and take notic like a babi they had reach
that phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright
but earth and all it grow thing look almost black by comparison
about thi particular even howev there wa someth except
it wa one of those rare atmospher in which a smoked-glass slide
seem to have been slid away from between us and nature; so that even
dark colour on that day look more gorgeou than bright colour
on cloudier day the trampl earth of the river-bank and
the peati stain in the pool did not look drab but glow umber
and the dark wood astir in the breez did not look as usual dim blue
with mere depth of distanc but more like wind-tumbl mass of some
vivid violet blossom thi magic clear and intens in the colour
wa further forc on brown slowli reviv sens by someth
romant and even secret in the veri form of the landscap

the river wa still well wide and deep enough for a pleasur boat
so small as theirs; but the curv of the country-sid suggest
that it wa close in on either hand; the wood seem to be make
broken and fli attempt at bridge-building--a if the boat
were pass from the romanc of a valley to the romanc of a hollow
and so to the suprem romanc of a tunnel beyond thi mere
look of thing there wa littl for brown freshen fanci to feed on;
he saw no human be except some gipsi trail along the river bank
with faggot and osier cut in the forest; and one sight
no longer unconvent but in such remot part still uncommon:
a dark-hair ladi bare-head and paddl her own cano
if father brown ever attach ani import to either of these
he certainli forgot them at the next turn of the river which
brought in sight a singular object

the water seem to widen and split be cloven by the dark wedg
of a fish-shap and wood islet with the rate at which they went
the islet seem to swim toward them like a ship; a ship with
a veri high prow--or to speak more strictli a veri high funnel
for at the extrem point nearest them stood up an odd-look build
unlik anyth they could rememb or connect with ani purpos
it wa not special high but it wa too high for it breadth
to be call anyth but a tower yet it appear to be built
entir of wood and that in a most unequ and eccentr way
some of the plank and beam were of good season oak; some of
such wood cut raw and recent; some again of white pinewood
and a great deal more of the same sort of wood paint black with tar
these black beam were set crook or crisscross at all kind of angl
give the whole a most patchi and puzzl appear
there were one or two window which appear to be colour and
lead in an old-fashion but more elabor style the travel
look at it with that paradox feel we have when someth
remind us of someth and yet we are certain it is someth
veri differ

father brown even when he wa mystifi wa clever in analys
hi own mystif and he found himself reflect that
the odditi seem to consist in a particular shape cut out in
an incongru material; as if one saw a top-hat made of tin
or a frock-coat cut out of tartan he wa sure he had seen timber
of differ tint arrang like that somewher but never
in such architectur proport the next moment a glimps
through the dark tree told him all he want to know and he laugh
through a gap in the foliag there appear for a moment one of those
old wooden hous face with black beam which are still to be found
here and there in england but which most of us see imit
in some show call old london or shakespear england
it wa in view onli long enough for the priest to see that
howev old-fashion it wa a comfort and well-kept country-hous
with flower-b in front of it it had none of the piebald and crazi
look of the tower that seem made out of it refus

what on earth this? said flambeau who wa still stare
at the tower

fanshaw eye were shine and he spoke triumphantli
aha! youv not seen a place quit like thi befor i fancy;
that whi ive brought you here my friend now you shall see
whether i exagger about the marin of cornwal thi place belong
to old pendragon whom we call the admiral; though he retir
befor get the rank the spirit of raleigh and hawkin is a memori
with the devon folk; it a modern fact with the pendragon
if queen elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up thi river
in a gild barg she would be receiv by the admir in a hous
exactli such as she wa accustom to in everi corner and casement
in everi panel on the wall or plate on the tabl and she would find
an english captain still talk fierc of fresh land to be found
in littl ship as much as if she had dine with drake

shed find a rum sort of thing in the garden said father brown
which would not pleas her renaiss eye that elizabethan domest
architectur is charm in it way; but it against the veri natur
of it to break out into turret

and yet answer fanshaw that the most romant and
elizabethan part of the busi it wa built by the pendragon
in the veri day of the spanish wars; and though it need patch
and even rebuild for anoth reason it alway been rebuilt
in the old way the stori goe that the ladi of sir peter pendragon
built it in thi place and to thi height becaus from the top
you can just see the corner where vessel turn into the river mouth;
and she wish to be the first to see her husband ship
as he sail home from the spanish main

for what other reason ask father brown do you mean that
it ha been rebuilt?

oh there a strang stori about that too said the young squir
with relish you are realli in a land of strang stori
king arthur wa here and merlin and the fairi befor him
the stori goe that sir peter pendragon who (i fear) had some of
the fault of the pirat as well as the virtu of the sailor
wa bring home three spanish gentlemen in honour captiv
intend to escort them to elizabeth court but he wa a man
of flame and tigerish temper and come to high word with one of them
he caught him by the throat and flung him by accid or design
into the sea a second spaniard who wa the brother of the first
instantli drew hi sword and flew at pendragon and after a short but
furiou combat in which both got three wound in as mani minut
pendragon drove hi blade through the other bodi and the second spaniard
wa account for as it happen the ship had alreadi turn
into the river mouth and wa close to compar shallow water
the third spaniard sprang over the side of the ship struck out
for the shore and wa soon near enough to it to stand up to hi waist
in water and turn again to face the ship and hold up both
arm to heaven--lik a prophet call plagu upon a wick city--
he call out to pendragon in a pierc and terribl voic
that he at least wa yet live that he would go on live
that he would live for ever; and that gener after gener
the hous of pendragon should never see him or hi but should know
by veri certain sign that he and hi vengeanc were aliv
with that he dive under the wave and wa either drown or swam
so long under water that no hair of hi head wa seen afterward

there that girl in the cano again said flambeau irrelevantli
for good-look young women would call him off ani topic
she seem bother by the queer tower just as we were

inde the black-hair young ladi wa let her cano float
slowli and silent past the strang islet; and wa look intent up
at the strang tower with a strong glow of curios on her oval
and oliv face

never mind girl said fanshaw impati there are plenti
of them in the world but not mani thing like the pendragon tower
as you may easili suppos plenti of superstit and scandal
have follow in the track of the spaniard curse; and no doubt
as you would put it ani accid happen to thi cornish famili
would be connect with it by rural credul but it is perfectli true
that thi tower ha been burnt down two or three times; and the famili
cant be call lucki for more than two i think of the admir
near kin have perish by shipwreck; and one at least to my own knowledg
on practic the same spot where sir peter threw the spaniard overboard

what a pity! exclaim flambeau she go

when did your friend the admir tell you thi famili history?
ask father brown as the girl in the cano paddl off
without show the least intent of extend her interest from
the tower to the yacht which fanshaw had alreadi caus to lie
alongsid the island

mani year ago repli fanshaw; he hasnt been to sea for
some time now though he is as keen on it as ever i believ there
a famili compact or someth well here the land stage;
let come ashor and see the old boy

they follow him on to the island just under the tower
and father brown whether from the mere touch of dri land or the interest
of someth on the other bank of the river (which he stare at
veri hard for some seconds) seem singularli improv in brisk
they enter a wood avenu between two fenc of thin greyish wood
such as often enclos park or garden and over the top of which
the dark tree toss to and fro like black and purpl plume upon
the hears of a giant the tower as they left it behind
look all the quainter becaus such entranc are usual flank
by two towers; and thi one look lopsid but for thi the avenu
had the usual appear of the entranc to a gentleman grounds;
and be so curv that the hous wa now out of sight
somehow look a much larger park than ani plantat on such an island
could realli be father brown wa perhap a littl fanci
in hi fatigu but he almost thought the whole place must be
grow larger as thing do in a nightmar anyhow a mystic monotoni
wa the onli charact of their march until fanshaw suddenli stop
and point to someth stick out through the grey fence--
someth that look at first rather like the imprison horn
of some beast closer observ show that it wa
a slightli curv blade of metal that shone faintli in the fade light

flambeau who like all frenchmen had been a soldier bent over it
and said in a startl voice: whi it a sabre! i believ
i know the sort heavi and curv but shorter than the cavalry;
they use to have them in artilleri and the--

as he spoke the blade pluck itself out of the crack it had made
and came down again with a more ponder slash split
the fissipar fenc to the bottom with a rend nois
then it wa pull out again flash abov the fenc some feet
further along and again split it halfway down with the first stroke;
and after waggl a littl to extric itself (accompani with
curs in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second
then a kick of devilish energi sent the whole loosen squar
of thin wood fli into the pathway and a great gap of dark coppic
gape in the pale

fanshaw peer into the dark open and utter an exclam
of astonish my dear admiral! he exclaim do you--er--
do you gener cut out a new front door whenev you want to
go for a walk?

the voic in the gloom swore again and then broke into a jolli laugh
no it said; ive realli got to cut down thi fenc somehow;
it spoil all the plant and no one els here can do it
but ill onli carv anoth bit off the front door and then come out
and welcom you

and sure enough he heav up hi weapon onc more and
hack twice brought down anoth and similar strip of fenc
make the open about fourteen feet wide in all then through thi
larger forest gateway he came out into the even light
with a chip of grey wood stick to hi sword-blad

he momentarili fulfil all fanshaw fabl of an old pirat
admiral; though the detail seem afterward to decompos into accid
for instanc he wore a broad-brim hat as protect against the sun;
but the front flap of it wa turn up straight to the sky and the
two corner pull down lower than the ear so that it stood across
hi forehead in a crescent like the old cock hat worn by nelson
he wore an ordinari dark-blu jacket with noth special about
the button but the combin of it with white linen trouser
somehow had a sailorish look he wa tall and loos and walk with
a sort of swagger which wa not a sailor roll and yet somehow
suggest it; and he held in hi hand a short sabr which wa like
a navi cutlass but about twice as big under the bridg of the hat
hi eagl face look eager all the more becaus it wa not onli
clean-shaven but without eyebrow it seem almost as if all
the hair had come off hi face from hi thrust it through
a throng of element hi eye were promin and pierc
hi colour wa curious attract while partli tropical;
it remind one vagu of a blood-orang that is that while it wa
ruddi and sanguin there wa a yellow in it that wa in no way sickli
but seem rather to glow like gold appl of the hesperides--
father brown thought he had never seen a figur so express
of all the romanc about the countri of the sun

when fanshaw had present hi two friend to their host
he fell again into a tone of ralli the latter about hi wreckag
of the fenc and hi appar rage of profan the admir pooh-pooh
it at first as a piec of necessari but annoy garden work;
but at length the ring of real energi came back into hi laughter
and he cri with a mixtur of impati and good humour:

well perhap i do go at it a bit rabidli and feel
a kind of pleasur in smash anyth so would you if your
onli pleasur wa in cruis about to find some new cannib island
and you had to stick on thi muddi littl rockeri in a sort of rustic pond
when i rememb how ive cut down a mile and a half of green poison
jungl with an old cutlass half as sharp as this; and then rememb
i must stop here and chop thi matchwood becaus of some confound
old bargain scribbl in a famili bibl whi i--

he swung up the heavi steel again; and thi time sunder
the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke

i feel like that he said laugh but furious fling
the sword some yard down the path and now let go up to the house;
you must have some dinner

the semicircl of lawn in front of the hous wa vari by
three circular garden bed one of red tulip a second of
yellow tulip and the third of some white waxen-look blossom
that the visitor did not know and presum to be exot
a heavi hairi and rather sullen-look garden wa hang up
a heavi coil of garden hose the corner of the expir sunset
which seem to cling about the corner of the hous gave glimps
here and there of the colour of remot flowerbeds; and in
a treeless space on one side of the hous open upon the river
stood a tall brass tripod on which wa tilt a big brass telescop
just outsid the step of the porch stood a littl paint
green garden tabl as if someon had just had tea there
the entranc wa flank with two of those half-featur lump of stone
with hole for eye that are said to be south sea idols; and on
the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confus carv
that look almost as barbar

as they pass indoor the littl cleric hop suddenli
on to the tabl and stand on it peer unaffectedli
through hi spectacl at the mould in the oak admir pendragon
look veri much astonish though not particularli annoyed;
while fanshaw wa so amus with what look like a perform pigmi
on hi littl stand that he could not control hi laughter
but father brown wa not like to notic either the laughter
or the astonish

he wa gaze at three carv symbol which though veri worn
and obscur seem still to convey some sens to him the first
seem to be the outlin of some tower or other build crown with
what look like curly-point ribbon the second wa clearer:
an old elizabethan galley with decor wave beneath it
but interrupt in the middl by a curiou jag rock which wa either
a fault in the wood or some convent represent of the water
come in the third repres the upper half of a human figur
end in an escallop line like the waves; the face wa rub
and featureless and both arm were held veri stiffli up in the air

well mutter father brown blink here is the legend
of the spaniard plain enough here he is hold up hi arm
and curs in the sea; and here are the two curses: the wreck ship
and the burn of pendragon tower

pendragon shook hi head with a kind of vener amus
and how mani other thing might it not be? he said dont you know
that that sort of half-man like a half-lion or half-stag
is quit common in heraldry? might not that line through the ship
be one of those parti-per-pal line indent i think they call it?
and though the third thing isnt so veri herald it would be
more herald to suppos it a tower crown with laurel than with fire;
and it look just as like it

but it seem rather odd said flambeau that it should
exactli confirm the old legend

ah repli the sceptic travel but you dont know
how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figur
besid it isnt the onli old legend fanshaw here who is
fond of such thing will tell you there are other version of the tale
and much more horribl one one stori credit my unfortun ancestor
with have had the spaniard cut in two; and that will fit
the pretti pictur also anoth obligingli credit our famili
with the possess of a tower full of snake and explain those littl
wriggli thing in that way and a third theori suppos the crook line
on the ship to be a convention thunderbolt; but that alon
if serious examin would show what a veri littl way these
unhappi coincid realli go

whi how do you mean? ask fanshaw

it so happen repli hi host coolli that there wa
no thunder and lightn at all in the two or three shipwreck
i know of in our famili

oh! said father brown and jump down from the littl tabl

there wa anoth silenc in which they heard the continu murmur
of the river; then fanshaw said in a doubt and perhap
disappoint tone: then you dont think there is anyth in the
tale of the tower in flames?

there are the tale of cours said the admir
shrug hi shoulders; and some of them i dont deni
on evid as decent as one ever get for such thing
someon saw a blaze hereabout dont you know as he walk home
through a wood; someon keep sheep on the upland inland thought
he saw a flame hover over pendragon tower well a damp dab of mud
like thi confound island seem the last place where one would
think of fire

what is that fire over there? ask father brown with
a gentl sudden point to the wood on the left river-bank
they were all thrown a littl off their balanc and the more fanci
fanshaw had even some difficulti in recov hi as they saw a long
thin stream of blue smoke ascend silent into the end of
the even light

then pendragon broke into a scorn laugh again gipsies!
he said; theyv been camp about here for about a week
gentlemen you want your dinner and he turn as if to enter the hous

but the antiquarian superstit in fanshaw wa still quiver
and he said hastily: but admir what that hiss nois
quit near the island? it veri like fire

it more like what it is said the admir laugh as he
led the way; it onli some cano go by

almost as he spoke the butler a lean man in black
with veri black hair and a veri long yellow face appear in the doorway
and told him that dinner wa serv

the dining-room wa as nautic as the cabin of a ship;
but it note wa rather that of the modern than the elizabethan captain
there were inde three antiqu cutlass in a trophi over
the fireplac and one brown sixteenth-centuri map with triton
and littl ship dot about a curli sea but such thing were
less promin on the white panel than some case of quaint-colour
south american bird veri scientif stuf fantast shell
from the pacif and sever instrument so rude and queer in shape
that savag might have use them either to kill their enemi or
to cook them but the alien colour culmin in the fact that
besid the butler the admir onli servant were two negro
somewhat quaintli clad in tight uniform of yellow the priest
instinct trick of analys hi own impress told him that
the colour and the littl neat coat-tail of these bipe had suggest
the word canari and so by a mere pun connect them with
southward travel toward the end of the dinner they took their
yellow cloth and black face out of the room leav onli
the black cloth and yellow face of the butler

im rather sorri you take thi so lightli said fanshaw to the host;
for the truth is ive brought these friend of mine with the idea
of their help you as they know a good deal of these thing
dont you realli believ in the famili stori at all?

i dont believ in anyth answer pendragon veri briskli
with a bright eye cock at a red tropic bird im a man of scienc

rather to flambeau surpris hi cleric friend
who seem to have entir woken up took up the digress and
talk natur histori with hi host with a flow of word and
much unexpect inform until the dessert and decant were
set down and the last of the servant vanish then he said
without alter hi tone

pleas dont think me impertin admir pendragon i dont
ask for curios but realli for my guidanc and your conveni
have i made a bad shot if i guess you dont want these old thing
talk of befor your butler?

the admir lift the hairless arch over hi eye and exclaimed:
well i dont know where you got it but the truth is i cant stand
the fellow though ive no excus for discharg a famili servant
fanshaw with hi fairi tale would say my blood move against men
with that black spanish-look hair

flambeau struck the tabl with hi heavi fist by jove! he cried;
and so had that girl!

i hope itll all end tonight continu the admir
when my nephew come back safe from hi ship you look surpris
you wont understand i suppos unless i tell you the stori
you see my father had two sons; i remain a bachelor
but my elder brother marri and had a son who becam a sailor
like all the rest of us and will inherit the proper estat
well my father wa a strang man; he somehow combin fanshaw
superstit with a good deal of my scepticism--they were alway
fight in him; and after my first voyag he develop a notion
which he thought somehow would settl final whether the curs
wa truth or trash if all the pendragon sail about anyhow
he thought there would be too much chanc of natur catastroph
to prove anyth but if we went to sea one at a time in strict order
of success to the properti he thought it might show whether ani
connect fate follow the famili as a famili it wa a silli notion
i think and i quarrel with my father pretti heartily; for i wa
an ambiti man and wa left to the last come by success
after my own nephew

and your father and brother said the priest veri gentli
die at sea i fear

ye groan the admiral; by one of those brutal accid
on which are built all the lie mytholog of mankind
they were both shipwreck my father come up thi coast
out of the atlant wa wash up on these cornish rock
my brother ship wa sunk no one know where on the voyag home
from tasmania hi bodi wa never found i tell you it wa
from perfectli natur mishap; lot of other peopl besid pendragon
were drowned; and both disast are discuss in a normal way
by navig but of cours it set thi forest of superstit on fire;
and men saw the flame tower everywher that whi i say it will
be all right when walter return the girl he engag to wa
come today; but i wa so afraid of some chanc delay frighten her
that i wire her not to come till she heard from me but he practic
sure to be here some time tonight and then itll all end in smoke--
tobacco smoke well crack that old lie when we crack a bottl
of thi wine

veri good wine said father brown grave lift hi glass
but as you see a veri bad wine-bibb i most sincer
beg your pardon: for he had spilt a small spot of wine on
the table-cloth he drank and put down the glass with a compos face;
but hi hand had start at the exact moment when he becam consciou
of a face look in through the garden window just behind the admiral--
the face of a woman swarthi with southern hair and eye and young
but like a mask of tragedi

after a paus the priest spoke again in hi mild manner
admir he said will you do me a favour? let me and my friend
if they like stop in that tower of your just for tonight?
do you know that in my busi your an exorcist almost befor
anyth else?

pendragon sprang to hi feet and pace swiftli to and fro
across the window from which the face had instantli vanish
i tell you there is noth in it he cri with ring violenc
there is one thing i know about thi matter you may call me an atheist
i am an atheist here he swung round and fix father brown with a face
of fright concentr thi busi is perfectli natur
there is no curs in it at all

father brown smile in that case he said there cant be
ani object to my sleep in your delight summer-hous

the idea is utterli ridicul repli the admir
beat a tattoo on the back of hi chair

pleas forgiv me for everyth said brown in hi most
sympathet tone includ spill the wine but it seem to me
you are not quit so easi about the flame tower as you tri to be

admir pendragon sat down again as abruptli as he had risen;
but he sat quit still and when he spoke again it wa in a lower voic
you do it at your own peril he said; but wouldnt you be an atheist
to keep sane in all thi devilry?

some three hour afterward fanshaw flambeau and the priest
were still dawdl about the garden in the dark; and it began to dawn
on the other two that father brown had no intent of go to bed
either in the tower or the hous

i think the lawn want weed said he dreamili
if i could find a spud or someth id do it myself

they follow him laugh and half remonstrating; but he repli
with the utmost solemn explain to them in a madden littl sermon
that one can alway find some small occup that is help to other
he did not find a spud; but he found an old broom made of twig
with which he began energet to brush the fallen leav off the grass

alway some littl thing to be done he said with
idiot cheerfulness; as georg herbert says: `who sweep
an admir garden in cornwal as for thi law make that and
the action fine and now he ad suddenli sling the broom away
let go and water the flower

with the same mix emot they watch him uncoil some
consider length of the larg garden hose say with an air of
wist discrimination: the red tulip befor the yellow i think
look a bit dri dont you think?

he turn the littl tap on the instrument and the water shot out
straight and solid as a long rod of steel

look out samson cri flambeau; whi youv cut off
the tulip head

father brown stood ruefulli contempl the decapit plant

mine doe seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of water
he admit scratch hi head i suppos it a piti i didnt
find the spud you should have seen me with the spud! talk of tool
youv got that swordstick flambeau you alway carry? that right;
and sir cecil could have that sword the admir threw away
by the fenc here how grey everyth looks!

the mist rise from the river said the stare flambeau

almost as he spoke the huge figur of the hairi garden appear
on a higher ridg of the trench and terrac lawn hail them with
a brandish rake and a horribl bellow voic put down that hose
he shouted; put down that hose and go to your--

i am fear clumsi repli the reverend gentleman weakly;
do you know i upset some wine at dinner he made a waver
half-turn of apolog toward the garden with the hose still spout
in hi hand the garden caught the cold crash of the water
full in hi face like the crash of a cannon-ball; stagger
slip and went sprawl with hi boot in the air

how veri dreadful! said father brown look round in
a sort of wonder whi ive hit a man!

he stood with hi head forward for a moment as if
look or listening; and then set off at a trot toward the tower
still trail the hose behind him the tower wa quit close
but it outlin wa curious dim

your river mist he said ha a rum smell

by the lord it ha cri fanshaw who wa veri white
but you cant mean--

i mean said father brown that one of the admir scientif
predict is come true tonight thi stori is go to end in smoke

as he spoke a most beauti rose-r light seem to burst
into blossom like a gigant rose; but accompani with a crackl
and rattl nois that wa like the laughter of devil

my god! what is this? cri sir cecil fanshaw

the sign of the flame tower said father brown and sent
the drive water from hi hose into the heart of the red patch

lucki we hadnt gone to bed! ejacul fanshaw i suppos
it cant spread to the hous

you may rememb said the priest quietli that the wooden fenc
that might have carri it wa cut away

flambeau turn electrifi eye upon hi friend but fanshaw
onli said rather absently: well nobodi can be kill anyhow

thi is rather a curiou kind of tower observ father brown
when it take to kill peopl it alway kill peopl
who are somewher els

at the same instant the monstrou figur of the garden with
the stream beard stood again on the green ridg against the sky
wave other to come on; but now wave not a rake but a cutlass
behind him came the two negro also with the old crook cutlass
out of the trophi but in the blood-r glare with their black face
and yellow figur they look like devil carri instrument of tortur
in the dim garden behind them a distant voic wa heard call out
brief direct when the priest heard the voic a terribl chang
came over hi counten

but he remain composed; and never took hi eye off
the patch of flame which had begun by spread but now seem
to shrink a littl as it hiss under the torch of the long silver spear
of water he kept hi finger along the nozzl of the pipe to ensur the aim
and attend to no other busi know onli by the nois and
that semi-consci corner of the eye the excit incid that
began to tumbl themselv about the island garden he gave two brief
direct to hi friend one was: knock these fellow down somehow
and tie them up whoever they are; there rope down by those faggot
they want to take away my nice hose the other was: as soon as you
get a chanc call out to that cano girl; she over on the bank
with the gipsi ask her if they could get some bucket across
and fill them from the river then he close hi mouth and continu
to water the new red flower as ruthlessli as he had water the red tulip

he never turn hi head to look at the strang fight that
follow between the foe and friend of the mysteri fire
he almost felt the island shake when flambeau collid with
the huge gardener; he mere imagin how it would whirl round them
as they wrestl he heard the crash fall; and hi friend
gasp of triumph as he dash on to the first negro; and the cri
of both the black as flambeau and fanshaw bound them
flambeau enorm strength more than redress the odd in the fight
especi as the fourth man still hover near the hous
onli a shadow and a voic he heard also the water broken by
the paddl of a canoe; the girl voic give order
the voic of gipsi answer and come nearer the plump and
suck nois of empti bucket plung into a full stream; and final
the sound of mani feet around the fire but all thi wa less to him
than the fact that the red rent which had late onc more increas
had onc more slightli diminish

then came a cri that veri nearli made him turn hi head
flambeau and fanshaw now reinforc by some of the gipsi
had rush after the mysteri man by the house; and he heard from
the other end of the garden the frenchman cri of horror and astonish
it wa echo by a howl not to be call human as the be broke
from their hold and ran along the garden three time at least
it race round the whole island in a way that wa as horribl as
the chase of a lunat both in the cri of the pursu and the rope
carri by the pursuers; but wa more horribl still becaus it somehow
suggest one of the chase game of children in a garden
then find them close in on everi side the figur sprang upon
one of the higher river bank and disappear with a splash
into the dark and drive river

you can do no more i fear said brown in a voic cold with pain
he ha been wash down to the rock by now where he ha sent
so mani other he knew the use of a famili legend

oh dont talk in these parabl cri flambeau impati
cant you put it simpli in word of one syllable?

ye answer brown with hi eye on the hose `both eye bright
she all right; one eye blink down she sink

the fire hiss and shriek more and more like a strangl thing
as it grew narrow and narrow under the flood from the pipe and bucket
but father brown still kept hi eye on it as he went on speaking:

i thought of ask thi young ladi if it were morn yet
to look through that telescop at the river mouth and the river
she might have seen someth to interest her: the sign of the ship
or mr walter pendragon come home and perhap even the sign of
the half-man for though he is certainli safe by now he may veri well
have wade ashor he ha been within a shave of anoth shipwreck;
and would never have escap it if the ladi hadnt had the sens
to suspect the old admir telegram and come down to watch him
dont let talk about the old admir dont let talk about anyth
it enough to say that whenev thi tower with it pitch and resin-wood
realli caught fire the spark on the horizon alway look like
the twin light to the coast light-hous

and that said flambeau is how the father and brother die
the wick uncl of the legend veri nearli got hi estat after all

father brown did not answer; inde he did not speak again
save for civil till they were all safe round a cigar-box in
the cabin of the yacht he saw that the frustrat fire wa extinguished;
and then refus to linger though he actual heard young pendragon
escort by an enthusiast crowd come tramp up the river bank;
and might (had he been move by romant curiosities) have receiv
the combin thank of the man from the ship and the girl from the cano
but hi fatigu had fallen on him onc more and he onli start onc
when flambeau abruptli told him he had drop cigar-ash on hi trouser

that no cigar-ash he said rather wearili that from the fire
but you dont think so becaus your all smoke cigar
that just the way i got my first faint suspicion about the chart

do you mean pendragon chart of hi pacif islands? ask fanshaw

you thought it wa a chart of the pacif island answer brown
put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyon will
think it a specimen put the same feather with a ribbon and
an artifici flower and everyon will think it for a ladi hat
put the same feather with an ink-bottl a book and a stack
of writing-pap and most men will swear theyv seen a quill pen
so you saw that map among tropic bird and shell and thought it wa
a map of pacif island it wa the map of thi river

but how do you know? ask fanshaw

i saw the rock you thought wa like a dragon and the one
like merlin and--

you seem to have notic a lot as we came in cri fanshaw
we thought you were rather abstract

i wa sea-sick said father brown simpli i felt simpli horribl
but feel horribl ha noth to do with not see thing
and he close hi eye

do you think most men would have seen that? ask flambeau
he receiv no answer: father brown wa asleep




ix the god of the gong


it wa one of those chilli and empti afternoon in earli winter
when the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver
if it wa dreari in a hundr bleak offic and yawn drawing-room
it wa drearier still along the edg of the flat essex coast
where the monotoni wa the more inhuman for be broken
at veri long interv by a lamp-post that look less civil
than a tree or a tree that look more ugli than a lamp-post
a light fall of snow had half-melt into a few strip also look leaden
rather than silver when it had been fix again by the seal of frost;
no fresh snow had fallen but a ribbon of the old snow ran along
the veri margin of the coast so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam

the line of the sea look frozen in the veri vivid of
it violet-blu like the vein of a frozen finger for mile and mile
forward and back there wa no breath soul save two pedestrian
walk at a brisk pace though one had much longer leg and took
much longer stride than the other

it did not seem a veri appropri place or time for a holiday
but father brown had few holiday and had to take them when he could
and he alway prefer if possibl to take them in compani with
hi old friend flambeau ex-crimin and ex-detect the priest had
had a fanci for visit hi old parish at cobhol and wa go
north-eastward along the coast

after walk a mile or two farther they found that the shore wa
begin to be formal embank so as to form someth like a parade;
the ugli lamp-post becam less few and far between and more ornament
though quit equal ugli half a mile farther on father brown
wa puzzl first by littl labyrinth of flowerless flower-pot
cover with the low flat quiet-colour plant that look less like
a garden than a tessel pavement between weak curli path stud
with seat with curli back he faintli snif the atmospher of
a certain sort of seasid town that be did not special care about
and look ahead along the parad by the sea he saw someth that
put the matter beyond a doubt in the grey distanc the big bandstand
of a watering-plac stood up like a giant mushroom with six leg

i suppos said father brown turn up hi coat-collar
and draw a woollen scarf rather closer round hi neck
that we are approach a pleasur resort

i fear answer flambeau a pleasur resort to which
few peopl just now have the pleasur of resort they tri to
reviv these place in the winter but it never succe except with
brighton and the old one thi must be seawood i think--
lord pooley experiment; he had the sicilian singer down at christma
and there talk about hold one of the great glove-fight here
but theyll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea;
it as dreari as a lost railway-carriag

they had come under the big bandstand and the priest wa
look up at it with a curios that had someth rather odd about it
hi head a littl on one side like a bird it wa the convent
rather tawdri kind of erect for it purpose: a flatten dome
or canopi gilt here and there and lift on six slender pillar
of paint wood the whole be rais about five feet abov the parad
on a round wooden platform like a drum but there wa someth
fantast about the snow combin with someth artifici about
the gold that haunt flambeau as well as hi friend with
some associ he could not captur but which he knew wa at onc
artist and alien

ive got it he said at last it japanes it like
those fanci japanes print where the snow on the mountain
look like sugar and the gilt on the pagoda is like gilt on gingerbread
it look just like a littl pagan templ

ye said father brown let have a look at the god
and with an agil hardli to be expect of him he hop up
on to the rais platform

oh veri well said flambeau laughing; and the next instant
hi own tower figur wa visibl on that quaint elev

slight as wa the differ of height it gave in those level wast
a sens of see yet farther and farther across land and sea
inland the littl wintri garden fade into a confus grey copse;
beyond that in the distanc were long low barn of a lone farmhous
and beyond that noth but the long east anglian plain
seaward there wa no sail or sign of life save a few seagulls:
and even they look like the last snowflak and seem to float
rather than fli

flambeau turn abruptli at an exclam behind him
it seem to come from lower down than might have been expect
and to be address to hi heel rather than hi head he instantli
held out hi hand but he could hardli help laugh at what he saw
for some reason or other the platform had given way under father brown
and the unfortun littl man had drop through to the level
of the parad he wa just tall enough or short enough
for hi head alon to stick out of the hole in the broken wood
look like st john the baptist head on a charger the face wore
a disconcert express as did perhap that of st john the baptist

in a moment he began to laugh a littl thi wood must be rotten
said flambeau though it seem odd it should bear me and you go through
the weak place let me help you out

but the littl priest wa look rather curious at the corner
and edg of the wood alleg to be rotten and there wa a sort of troubl
on hi brow

come along cri flambeau impati still with hi big
brown hand extend dont you want to get out?

the priest wa hold a splinter of the broken wood between
hi finger and thumb and did not immedi repli at last he said
thoughtfully: want to get out? whi no i rather think i want
to get in and he dive into the dark under the wooden floor
so abruptli as to knock off hi big curv cleric hat and leav it
lie on the board abov without ani cleric head in it

flambeau look onc more inland and out to sea and onc more
could see noth but sea as wintri as the snow and snow as level
as the sea

there came a scurri nois behind him and the littl priest
came scrambl out of the hole faster than he had fallen in
hi face wa no longer disconcert but rather resolut and
perhap onli through the reflect of the snow a trifl paler than usual


well? ask hi tall friend have you found the god
of the temple?

no answer father brown i have found what wa sometim
more import the sacrific

what the devil do you mean? cri flambeau quit alarm

father brown did not answer he wa stare with a knot
in hi forehead at the landscape; and he suddenli point at it
what that hous over there? he ask

follow hi finger flambeau saw for the first time the corner
of a build nearer than the farmhous but screen for the most part
with a fring of tree it wa not a larg build and stood well back
from the shore-- but a glint of ornament on it suggest that it wa
part of the same watering-plac scheme of decor as the bandstand
the littl garden and the curly-back iron seat

father brown jump off the bandstand hi friend following;
and as they walk in the direct indic the tree fell away
to right and left and they saw a small rather flashi hotel
such as is common in resorts--th hotel of the saloon bar rather than
the bar parlour almost the whole frontag wa of gilt plaster and
figur glass and between that grey seascap and the grey
witch-lik tree it gimcrack qualiti had someth spectral
in it melancholi they both felt vagu that if ani food or drink
were offer at such a hostelri it would be the paste-board ham
and empti mug of the pantomim

in thi howev they were not altogeth confirm as they drew
nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet
which wa appar close one of the iron garden-seat with curli back
that had adorn the garden but much longer run almost
the whole length of the frontag presum it wa place so that
visitor might sit there and look at the sea but one hardli expect
to find anyon do it in such weather

nevertheless just in front of the extrem end of the iron seat
stood a small round restaur tabl and on thi stood
a small bottl of chabli and a plate of almond and raisin
behind the tabl and on the seat sat a dark-hair young man
barehead and gaze at the sea in a state of almost
astonish immobl

but though he might have been a waxwork when they were within
four yard of him he jump up like a jack-in-the-box when they
came within three and said in a deferenti though not undignifi
manner: will you step insid gentlemen? i have no staff at present
but i can get you anyth simpl myself

much oblig said flambeau so you are the proprietor?

ye said the dark man drop back a littl into
hi motionless manner my waiter are all italian you see
and i thought it onli fair they should see their countryman beat the black
if he realli can do it you know the great fight between malvoli and
nigger ned is come off after all?

im afraid we cant wait to troubl your hospit serious
said father brown but my friend would be glad of a glass of sherri
im sure to keep out the cold and drink success to the latin champion

flambeau did not understand the sherri but he did not object to it
in the least he could onli say amiably: oh thank you veri much

sherri sir--certainli said their host turn to hi hostel
excus me if i detain you a few minut as i told you
i have no staff-- and he went toward the black window of
hi shutter and unlight inn

oh it doesnt realli matter began flambeau but the man
turn to reassur him

i have the key he said i could find my way in the dark

i didnt mean-- began father brown

he wa interrupt by a bellow human voic that came
out of the bowel of the uninhabit hotel it thunder
some foreign name loudli but inaud and the hotel proprietor
move more sharpli toward it than he had done for flambeau sherri
as instant evid prove the proprietor had told then and after
noth but the liter truth but both flambeau and father brown
have often confess that in all their (often outrageous) adventur
noth had so chill their blood as that voic of an ogr
sound suddenli out of a silent and empti inn

my cook! cri the proprietor hastili i had forgotten my cook
he will be start present sherri sir?

and sure enough there appear in the doorway a big white bulk
with white cap and white apron as befit a cook but with
the needless emphasi of a black face flambeau had often heard
that negro made good cook but somehow someth in the contrast
of colour and cast increas hi surpris that the hotel proprietor
should answer the call of the cook and not the cook the call
of the proprietor but he reflect that head cook are proverbi
arrogant; and besid the host had come back with the sherri
and that wa the great thing

i rather wonder said father brown that there are so few peopl
about the beach when thi big fight is come on after all
we onli met one man for mile

the hotel proprietor shrug hi shoulder they come from
the other end of the town you see--from the station three mile from here
they are onli interest in the sport and will stop in hotel
for the night onli after all it is hardli weather for
bask on the shore

or on the seat said flambeau and point to the littl tabl

i have to keep a look-out said the man with the motionless face
he wa a quiet well-featur fellow rather sallow; hi dark cloth
had noth distinct about them except that hi black neckti
wa worn rather high like a stock and secur by a gold pin
with some grotesqu head to it nor wa there anyth notabl
in the face except someth that wa probabl a mere nervou trick--
a habit of open one eye more narrowli than the other
give the impress that the other wa larger or wa
perhap artifici

the silenc that ensu wa broken by their host say quietly:
whereabout did you meet the one man on your march?

curious enough answer the priest close by here--
just by that bandstand

flambeau who had sat on the long iron seat to finish hi sherri
put it down and rose to hi feet stare at hi friend in amaz
he open hi mouth to speak and then shut it again

curiou said the dark-hair man thought what wa he like?

it wa rather dark when i saw him began father brown
but he was--

as ha been said the hotel-keep can be prove to have told
the precis truth hi phrase that the cook wa start present
wa fulfil to the letter for the cook came out pull hi glove on
even as they spoke

but he wa a veri differ figur from the confus mass
of white and black that had appear for an instant in the doorway
he wa button and buckl up to hi burst eyebal in the most
brilliant fashion a tall black hat wa tilt on hi broad black head--
a hat of the sort that the french wit ha compar to eight mirror
but somehow the black man wa like the black hat he also wa black
and yet hi glossi skin flung back the light at eight angl or more
it is needless to say that he wore white spat and a white slip insid
hi waistcoat the red flower stood up in hi buttonhol aggress
as if it had suddenli grown there and in the way he carri hi cane
in one hand and hi cigar in the other there wa a certain attitude--
an attitud we must alway rememb when we talk of racial prejudices:
someth innoc and insolent--th cake walk

sometim said flambeau look after him im not surpris
that they lynch them

i am never surpris said father brown at ani work of hell
but as i wa say he resum as the negro still ostentati
pull on hi yellow glove betook himself briskli toward
the watering-plac a queer music-hal figur against that grey and
frosti scene--a i wa say i couldnt describ the man veri minut
but he had a flourish and old-fashion whisker and moustachio
dark or dy as in the pictur of foreign financi round hi neck
wa wrap a long purpl scarf that thrash out in the wind as he walk
it wa fix at the throat rather in the way that nurs
fix children comfort with a safety-pin onli thi
ad the priest gaze placidli out to sea wa not a safety-pin

the man sit on the long iron bench wa also gaze placidli
out to sea now he wa onc more in repos flambeau felt quit certain
that one of hi eye wa natur larger than the other
both were now well open and he could almost fanci the left eye
grew larger as he gaze

it wa a veri long gold pin and had the carv head of a monkey
or some such thing continu the cleric; and it wa fix
in a rather odd way--h wore pince-nez and a broad black--

the motionless man continu to gaze at the sea and the eye in
hi head might have belong to two differ men then he made
a movement of blind swift

father brown had hi back to him and in that flash might have
fallen dead on hi face flambeau had no weapon but hi larg
brown hand were rest on the end of the long iron seat
hi shoulder abruptli alter their shape and he heav
the whole huge thing high over hi head like a headsman axe
about to fall the mere height of the thing as he held it vertic
look like a long iron ladder by which he wa invit men to climb
toward the star but the long shadow in the level even light
look like a giant brandish the eiffel tower it wa the shock
of that shadow befor the shock of the iron crash that made the stranger
quail and dodg and then dart into hi inn leav the flat and
shine dagger he had drop exactli where it had fallen

we must get away from here instantli cri flambeau
fling the huge seat away with furiou indiffer on the beach
he caught the littl priest by the elbow and ran him down
a grey perspect of barren back garden at the end of which there
wa a close back garden door flambeau bent over it an instant
in violent silenc and then said: the door is lock

as he spoke a black feather from one of the ornament fir fell
brush the brim of hi hat it startl him more than the small
and distant deton that had come just befor then came anoth
distant deton and the door he wa tri to open shook
under the bullet buri in it flambeau shoulder again fill out
and alter suddenli three hing and a lock burst at the same instant
and he went out into the empti path behind carri the great garden door
with him as samson carri the gate of gaza

then he flung the garden door over the garden wall just as
a third shot pick up a spurt of snow and dust behind hi heel
without ceremoni he snatch up the littl priest slung him astraddl
on hi shoulder and went race toward seawood as fast as
hi long leg could carri him it wa not until nearli two mile
farther on that he set hi small companion down it had hardli been
a dignifi escap in spite of the classic model of anchis
but father brown face onli wore a broad grin

well said flambeau after an impati silenc as they resum
their more convent tramp through the street on the edg of the town
where no outrag need be fear i dont know what all thi mean
but i take it i may trust my own eye that you never met the man
you have so accur describ

i did meet him in a way brown said bite hi finger
rather nervously--i did realli and it wa too dark to see him properli
becaus it wa under that bandstand affair but im afraid i didnt
describ him so veri accur after all for hi pince-nez
wa broken under him and the long gold pin wasnt stuck through
hi purpl scarf but through hi heart

and i suppos said the other in a lower voic that glass-ey guy
had someth to do with it

i had hope he had onli a littl answer brown
in a rather troubl voic and i may have been wrong in what i did
i act on impuls but i fear thi busi ha deep root and dark

they walk on through some street in silenc the yellow lamp
were begin to be lit in the cold blue twilight and they were
evid approach the more central part of the town
highli colour bill announc the glove-fight between nigger ned
and malvoli were slap about the wall

well said flambeau i never murder anyon even in
my crimin day but i can almost sympath with anyon do it
in such a dreari place of all god-forsaken dustbin of natur
i think the most heart-break are place like that bandstand
that were meant to be festiv and are forlorn i can fanci a morbid man
feel he must kill hi rival in the solitud and ironi of such a scene
i rememb onc take a tramp in your gloriou surrey hill
think of noth but gors and skylark when i came out on
a vast circl of land and over me lift a vast voiceless structur
tier abov tier of seat as huge as a roman amphitheatr and as empti
as a new letter-rack a bird sail in heaven over it it wa
the grand stand at epsom and i felt that no one would ever
be happi there again

it odd you should mention epsom said the priest
do you rememb what wa call the sutton mysteri becaus two
suspect men--ice-cream men i think--happen to live at sutton?
they were eventu releas a man wa found strangl it wa said
on the down round that part as a fact i know (from an irish policeman
who is a friend of mine) that he wa found close up to the epsom
grand stand--in fact onli hidden by one of the lower door be
push back

that is queer assent flambeau but it rather confirm
my view that such pleasur place look aw lone out of season
or the man wouldnt have been murder there

im not so sure he-- began brown and stop

not so sure he wa murdered? queri hi companion

not so sure he wa murder out of the season answer
the littl priest with simplic dont you think there someth
rather tricki about thi solitud flambeau? do you feel sure
a wise murder would alway want the spot to be lonely?
it veri veri seldom a man is quit alon and short of that
the more alon he is the more certain he is to be seen
no; i think there must be some other--whi here we are at
the pavilion or palac or whatev they call it

they had emerg on a small squar brilliantli light
of which the princip build wa gay with gild gaudi with poster
and flank with two giant photograph of malvoli and nigger ned

hallo! cri flambeau in great surpris as hi cleric friend
stump straight up the broad step i didnt know pugil wa
your latest hobbi are you go to see the fight?

i dont think there will be ani fight repli father brown

they pass rapidli through ante-room and inner rooms;
they pass through the hall of combat itself rais rope
and pad with innumer seat and box and still the cleric did
not look round or paus till he came to a clerk at a desk outsid
a door mark committe there he stop and ask to see lord pooley

the attend observ that hi lordship wa veri busi
as the fight wa come on soon but father brown had a good-temp
tedium of reiter for which the offici mind is gener not prepar
in a few moment the rather baffl flambeau found himself in the presenc
of a man who wa still shout direct to anoth man go out of
the room be care you know about the rope after the fourth--
well and what do you want i wonder!

lord pooley wa a gentleman and like most of the few remain
to our race wa worried--especi about money he wa half grey
and half flaxen and he had the eye of fever and a high-bridg
frost-bitten nose

onli a word said father brown i have come to prevent
a man be kill

lord pooley bound off hi chair as if a spring had
flung him from it im damn if ill stand ani more of this!
he cri you and your committe and parson and petitions!
werent there parson in the old day when they fought without gloves?
now theyr fight with the regul glove and there not
the rag of a possibl of either of the boxer be kill

i didnt mean either of the boxer said the littl priest

well well well! said the nobleman with a touch of frosti humour
who go to be killed? the referee?

i dont know who go to be kill repli father brown
with a reflect stare if i did i shouldnt have to
spoil your pleasur i could simpli get him to escap
i never could see anyth wrong about prize-fight as it is
i must ask you to announc that the fight is off for the present

anyth else? jeer the gentleman with feverish eye
and what do you say to the two thousand peopl who have come to see it?

i say there will be one thousand nine-hundr and ninety-nin
of them left aliv when they have seen it said father brown

lord pooley look at flambeau is your friend mad? he ask

far from it wa the repli

and took here resum pooley in hi restless way
it wors than that a whole pack of italian have turn up
to back malvoli--swarthi savag fellow of some countri anyhow
you know what these mediterranean race are like if i send out word
that it off we shall have malvoli storm in here at the head of
a whole corsican clan

my lord it is a matter of life and death said the priest
ring your bell give your messag and see whether it is malvoli
who answer

the nobleman struck the bell on the tabl with an odd air
of new curios he said to the clerk who appear almost instantli
in the doorway: i have a seriou announc to make to the audienc
shortli meanwhil would you kindli tell the two champion that
the fight will have to be put off

the clerk stare for some second as if at a demon and vanish

what author have you for what you say? ask lord pooley
abruptli whom did you consult?

i consult a bandstand said father brown scratch hi head
but no im wrong; i consult a book too i pick it up
on a bookstal in london--veri cheap too

he had taken out of hi pocket a small stout leather-bound volum
and flambeau look over hi shoulder could see that it wa some
book of old travel and had a leaf turn down for refer

`the onli form in which voodoo-- began father brown read aloud

in which what? inquir hi lordship

`in which voodoo repeat the reader almost with relish
`i wide organ outsid jamaica itself is in the form known as
the monkey or the god of the gong which is power in mani part of
the two american contin especi among half-bre mani of whom
look exactli like white men it differ from most other form
of devil-worship and human sacrific in the fact that the blood
is not shed formal on the altar but by a sort of assassin
among the crowd the gong beat with a deafen din as
the door of the shrine open and the monkey-god is revealed;
almost the whole congreg rivet ecstat eye on him but after--

the door of the room wa flung open and the fashion negro
stood frame in it hi eyebal roll hi silk hat still insol
tilt on hi head huh! he cri show hi apish teeth
what this? huh! huh! you steal a colour gentleman prize--
prize hi already--yo think yo je save that white talian trash--

the matter is onli defer said the nobleman quietli
i will be with you to explain in a minut or two

who you to-- shout nigger ned begin to storm

my name is pooley repli the other with a credit cool
i am the organ secretari and i advis you just now
to leav the room

who thi fellow? demand the dark champion point to the
priest disdain

my name is brown wa the repli and i advis you just now
to leav the countri

the prize-fight stood glare for a few second and then
rather to the surpris of flambeau and the other strode out
send the door to with a crash behind him

well ask father brown rub hi dusti hair up
what do you think of leonardo da vinci? a beauti italian head

look here said lord pooley ive taken a consider respons
on your bare word i think you ought to tell me more about thi

you are quit right my lord answer brown and it wont take
long to tell he put the littl leather book in hi overcoat pocket
i think we know all that thi can tell us but you shall look at it
to see if im right that negro who ha just swagger out is one of
the most danger men on earth for he ha the brain of a european
with the instinct of a cannib he ha turn what wa clean
common-sens butcheri among hi fellow-barbarian into a veri modern
and scientif secret societi of assassin he doesnt know i know it
nor for the matter of that that i cant prove it

there wa a silenc and the littl man went on

but if i want to murder somebodi will it realli be the best plan
to make sure im alon with him?

lord pooley eye recov their frosti twinkl as he
look at the littl clergyman he onli said: if you want to
murder somebodi i should advis it

father brown shook hi head like a murder of much riper experi
so flambeau said he repli with a sigh but consid
the more a man feel lone the less he can be sure he is alon
it must mean empti space round him and they are just what
make him obviou have you never seen one ploughman from the height
or one shepherd from the valleys? have you never walk along a cliff
and seen one man walk along the sands? didnt you know when he
kill a crab and wouldnt you have known if it had been a creditor?
no! no! no! for an intellig murder such as you or i might be
it is an imposs plan to make sure that nobodi is look at you

but what other plan is there?

there is onli one said the priest to make sure
that everybodi is look at someth els a man is throttl
close by the big stand at epsom anybodi might have seen it done
while the stand stood empty--ani tramp under the hedg or motorist
among the hill but nobodi would have seen it when the stand
wa crowd and the whole ring roar when the favourit wa
come in first--or wasnt the twist of a neck-cloth
the thrust of a bodi behind a door could be done in an instant--
so long as it wa that instant it wa the same of cours
he continu turn to flambeau with that poor fellow
under the bandstand he wa drop through the hole (it wasnt
an accident hole) just at some veri dramat moment of the entertain
when the bow of some great violinist or the voic of some great singer
open or came to it climax and here of cours when the knock-out
blow came--it would not be the onli one that is the littl trick
nigger ned ha adopt from hi old god of gong

by the way malvoli-- pooley began

malvoli said the priest ha noth to do with it
i dare say he ha some italian with him but our amiabl friend
are not italian they are octoroon and african half-blood
of variou shade but i fear we english think all foreign
are much the same so long as they are dark and dirti also
he ad with a smile i fear the english declin to draw
ani fine distinct between the moral charact produc by my religion
and that which bloom out of voodoo

the blaze of the spring season had burst upon seawood
litter it foreshor with famin and bathing-machin
with nomad preacher and nigger minstrel befor the two friend
saw it again and long befor the storm of pursuit after the strang
secret societi had die away almost on everi hand the secret
of their purpos perish with them the man of the hotel wa found
drift dead on the sea like so much seaweed; hi right eye wa
close in peac but hi left eye wa wide open and glisten like glass
in the moon nigger ned had been overtaken a mile or two away
and murder three policemen with hi close left hand
the remain offic wa surprised--nay pained--and the negro got away
but thi wa enough to set all the english paper in a flame
and for a month or two the main purpos of the british empir wa
to prevent the buck nigger (who wa so in both senses) escap by ani
english port person of a figur remot reconcil with hi
were subject to quit extraordinari inquisit made to scrub
their face befor go on board ship as if each white complexion
were made up like a mask of greasepaint everi negro in england
wa put under special regul and made to report himself;
the outgo ship would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk
for peopl had found out how fear and vast and silent wa
the forc of the savag secret societi and by the time flambeau and
father brown were lean on the parad parapet in april the black man
meant in england almost what he onc meant in scotland

he must be still in england observ flambeau and horridli
well hidden too they must have found him at the port if he had

father brown also lean motionless on the parapet move one finger
for an instant into the direct of the soot-mask nigger sing

x the salad of colonel cray


father brown wa walk home from mass on a white weird morn
when the mist were slowli lifting--on of those morn when
the veri element of light appear as someth mysteri and new
the scatter tree outlin themselv more and more out of the vapour
as if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal
at yet more distant interv appear the hous upon the broken fring
of the suburb; their outlin becam clearer and clearer until
he recogn mani in which he had chanc acquaint and mani more
the name of whose owner he knew but all the window and door
were sealed; none of the peopl were of the sort that would be up
at such a time or still less on such an errand but as he pass under
the shadow of one handsom villa with veranda and wide ornat garden
he heard a nois that made him almost involuntarili stop
it wa the unmistak nois of a pistol or carbin or some
light firearm discharged; but it wa not thi that puzzl him most
the first full nois wa immedi follow by a seri of fainter noises--
as he count them about six he suppos it must be the echo;
but the odd thing wa that the echo wa not in the least like
the origin sound it wa not like anyth els that he could think of;
the three thing nearest to it seem to be the nois made by
siphon of soda-wat one of the mani nois made by an anim
and the nois made by a person attempt to conceal laughter
none of which seem to make much sens

father brown wa made of two men there wa a man of action
who wa as modest as a primros and as punctual as a clock;
who went hi small round of duti and never dream of alter it
there wa also a man of reflect who wa much simpler but much stronger
who could not easili be stopped; whose thought wa alway (in the onli
intellig sens of the words) free thought he could not help
even unconsci ask himself all the question that
there were to be ask and answer as mani of them as he could;
all that went on like hi breath or circul but he never
conscious carri hi action outsid the sphere of hi own duty;
and in thi case the two attitud were aptli test he wa just about
to resum hi trudg in the twilight tell himself it wa no affair
of hi but instinct twist and untwist twenti theori
about what the odd nois might mean then the grey sky-lin
brighten into silver and in the broaden light he realiz
that he had been to the hous which belong to an anglo-indian major
name putnam; and that the major had a nativ cook from malta who wa
of hi communion he also began to rememb that pistol-shot
are sometim seriou things; accompani with consequ with which
he wa legitim concern he turn back and went in
at the garden gate make for the front door

half-way down one side of the hous stood out a project
like a veri low shed; it wa as he afterward discov
a larg dustbin round the corner of thi came a figur
at first a mere shadow in the haze appar bend and peer about
then come nearer it solidifi into a figur that wa inde
rather unusu solid major putnam wa a bald-head bull-neck man
short and veri broad with one of those rather apoplect face
that are produc by a prolong attempt to combin the orient climat
with the occident luxuri but the face wa a good-humour one
and even now though evid puzzl and inquisit wore a kind of
innoc grin he had a larg palm-leaf hat on the back of hi head
(suggest a halo that wa by no mean appropri to the face)
but otherwis he wa clad onli in a veri vivid suit of stripe scarlet
and yellow pyjamas; which though glow enough to behold must have been
on a fresh morn pretti chilli to wear he had evid
come out of hi hous in a hurri and the priest wa not surpris
when he call out without further ceremony: did you hear that noise?

ye answer father brown; i thought i had better look in
in case anyth wa the matter

the major look at him rather queerli with hi good-humour
gooseberri eye what do you think the nois was? he ask

it sound like a gun or someth repli the other
with some hesitation; but it seem to have a singular sort of echo

the major wa still look at him quietli but with protrud eye
when the front door wa flung open releas a flood of gaslight
on the face of the fade mist; and anoth figur in pyjama sprang
or tumbl out into the garden the figur wa much longer leaner
and more athletic; the pyjama though equal tropic were
compar tast be of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe
the man wa haggard but handsom more sunburn than the other;
he had an aquilin profil and rather deep-sunken eye and a slight air
of odditi aris from the combin of coal-black hair with
a much lighter moustach all thi father brown absorb in detail
more at leisur for the moment he onli saw one thing about the man;
which wa the revolv in hi hand

cray! exclaim the major stare at him; did you fire that shot?

ye i did retort the black-hair gentleman hotly;
and so would you in my place if you were chase everywher
by devil and nearly--

the major seem to interven rather hurriedli thi is my friend
father brown he said and then to brown: i dont know whether
youv met colonel cray of the royal artilleri

i have heard of him of cours said the priest innoc
did you--did you hit anything?

i thought so answer cray with graviti

did he-- ask major putnam in a lower voic did he fall
or cri out or anything?

colonel cray wa regard hi host with a strang and steadi stare
ill tell you exactli what he did he said he sneez

father brown hand went half-way to hi head with the gestur
of a man rememb somebodi name he knew now what it wa
that wa neither soda-wat nor the snort of a dog

well ejacul the stare major i never heard befor
that a servic revolv wa a thing to be sneez at

nor i said father brown faintli it lucki you didnt
turn your artilleri on him or you might have given him quit a bad cold
then after a bewild paus he said: wa it a burglar?

let us go insid said major putnam rather sharpli
and led the way into hi hous

the interior exhibit a paradox often to be mark in such
morn hours: that the room seem brighter than the sky outside;
even after the major had turn out the one gaslight in the front hall
father brown wa surpris to see the whole dining-t set out
as for a festiv meal with napkin in their ring and wine-glass
of some six unnecessari shape set besid everi plate it wa common enough
at that time of the morn to find the remain of a banquet over-night;
but to find it freshli spread so earli wa unusu

while he stood waver in the hall major putnam rush past him
and sent a rage eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth
at last he spoke spluttering: all the silver gone! he gasp
fish-kniv and fork gone old cruet-stand gone even the old silver
cream-jug gone and now father brown i am readi to answer your question
of whether it wa a burglar

theyr simpli a blind said cray stubbornli i know better
than you whi peopl persecut thi house; i know better than you why--

the major pat him on the shoulder with a gestur almost peculiar
to the sooth of a sick child and said: it wa a burglar
obvious it wa a burglar

a burglar with a bad cold observ father brown that might
assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood

the major shook hi head in a sombr manner he must be far beyond
trace now i fear he said

then as the restless man with the revolv turn again toward
the door in the garden he ad in a huski confidenti voice:
i doubt whether i should send for the polic for fear my friend here
ha been a littl too free with hi bullet and got on the wrong side
of the law he live in veri wild places; and to be frank with you
i think he sometim fanci thing

i think you onc told me said brown that he believ some
indian secret societi is pursu him

major putnam nod but at the same time shrug hi shoulder
i suppos wed better follow him outsid he said i dont want
ani more--shal we say sneezing?

they pass out into the morn light which wa now even ting
with sunshin and saw colonel cray tall figur bent almost doubl
minut examin the condit of gravel and grass while the major
stroll unobtrus toward him the priest took an equal
indol turn which took him round the next corner of the hous
to within a yard or two of the project dustbin

he stood regard thi dismal object for some minut and a half--
then he step toward it lift the lid and put hi head insid
dust and other discolour matter shook upward as he did so;
but father brown never observ hi own appear whatev els
he observ he remain thu for a measur period as if engag
in some mysteri prayer then he came out again with some ash
on hi hair and walk unconcernedli away

by the time he came round to the garden door again he found
a group there which seem to roll away morbid as the sunlight
had alreadi roll away the mist it wa in no way ration reassuring;
it wa simpli broadli comic like a cluster of dickenss charact
major putnam had manag to slip insid and plung into a proper shirt and
trouser with a crimson cummerbund and a light squar jacket over all;
thu normal set off hi red festiv face seem burst with
a commonplac cordial he wa inde emphat but then he wa talk
to hi cook--th swarthi son of malta whose lean yellow and rather
careworn face contrast quaintli with hi snow-whit cap and costum
the cook might well be careworn for cookeri wa the major hobbi
he wa one of those amateur who alway know more than the profession
the onli other person he even admit to be a judg of an omelett
wa hi friend cray--and as brown rememb thi he turn to look
for the other offic in the new presenc of daylight and peopl cloth
and in their right mind the sight of him wa rather a shock
the taller and more eleg man wa still in hi night-garb
with tousl black hair and now crawl about the garden on hi hand
and knee still look for trace of the burglar; and now and again
to all appear strike the ground with hi hand in anger at not
find him see him thu quadruped in the grass the priest
rais hi eyebrow rather sadly; and for the first time guess that
fanci thing might be an euphem

the third item in the group of the cook and the epicur wa also
known to father brown; it wa audrey watson the major ward
and housekeeper; and at thi moment to judg by her apron
tucked-up sleev and resolut manner much more the housekeep
than the ward

it serv you right she wa saying: i alway told you
not to have that old-fashion cruet-stand

i prefer it said putnam placabl im old-fashion myself;
and the thing keep togeth

and vanish togeth as you see she retort well if you are
not go to bother about the burglar i shouldnt bother about the lunch
it sunday and we cant send for vinegar and all that in the town;
and you indian gentlemen cant enjoy what you call a dinner without
a lot of hot thing i wish to good now you hadnt ask
cousin oliv to take me to the music servic it isnt over
till half-past twelv and the colonel ha to leav by then
i dont believ you men can manag alon

oh ye we can my dear said the major look at her
veri amiabl marco ha all the sauc and weve often
done ourselv well in veri rough place as you might know by now
and it time you had a treat audrey; you mustnt be a housekeep
everi hour of the day; and i know you want to hear the music

i want to go to church she said with rather sever eye

she wa one of those handsom women who will alway be handsom
becaus the beauti is not in an air or a tint but in the veri structur
of the head and featur but though she wa not yet middle-ag
and her auburn hair wa of a titianesqu full in form and colour
there wa a look in her mouth and around her eye which suggest that
some sorrow wast her as wind wast at last the edg of a greek templ
for inde the littl domest difficulti of which she wa now speak
so decis wa rather comic than tragic father brown gather
from the cours of the convers that cray the other gourmet
had to leav befor the usual lunch-time; but that putnam hi host
not to be done out of a final feast with an old croni had arrang
for a special dejeun to be set out and consum in the cours of
the morn while audrey and other graver person were at morn servic
she wa go there under the escort of a rel and old friend of her
dr oliv oman who though a scientif man of a somewhat bitter type
wa enthusiast for music and would go even to church to get it
there wa noth in all thi that could conceiv concern
the tragedi in miss watson face; and by a half consciou instinct
father brown turn again to the seem lunat grub about
in the grass

when he stroll across to him the black unbrush head wa
lift abruptli as if in some surpris at hi continu presenc
and inde father brown for reason best known to himself
had linger much longer than polit required; or even
in the ordinari sens permit

well! cri cray with wild eye i suppos you think im mad
like the rest?

i have consid the thesi answer the littl man composedli
and i inclin to think you are not

what do you mean? snap cray quit savag

real madmen explain father brown alway encourag their
own morbid they never strive against it but you are tri
to find trace of the burglar; even when there arent ani
you are struggl against it you want what no madman ever want

and what is that?

you want to be prove wrong said brown

dure the last word cray had sprung or stagger to hi feet
and wa regard the cleric with agit eye by hell
but that is a true word! he cri they are all at me here
that the fellow wa onli after the silver--a if i shouldnt be
onli too pleas to think so! she been at me and he toss hi tousl
black head toward audrey but the other had no need of the direct
she been at me today about how cruel i wa to shoot a poor harmless
house-break and how i have the devil in me against poor harmless nativ
but i wa a good-natur man once--a good-natur as putnam

after a paus he said: look here ive never seen you before;
but you shall judg of the whole stori old putnam and i were friend
in the same mess; but owe to some accid on the afghan border
i got my command much sooner than most men; onli we were both
invalid home for a bit i wa engag to audrey out there;
and we all travel back togeth but on the journey back
thing happen curiou thing the result of them wa
that putnam want it broken off and even audrey keep it hang on--
and i know what they mean i know what they think i am so do you

well these are the fact the last day we were in
an indian citi i ask putnam if i could get some trichinopoli cigar
he direct me to a littl place opposit hi lodg
i have sinc found he wa quit right; but `opposit is a danger word
when one decent hous stand opposit five or six squalid ones;
and i must have mistaken the door it open with difficulti
and then onli on darkness; but as i turn back the door behind me
sank back and settl into it place with a nois as of innumer bolt
there wa noth to do but to walk forward; which i did through
passag after passag pitch-dark then i came to a flight of step
and then to a blind door secur by a latch of elabor eastern ironwork
which i could onli trace by touch but which i loosen at last
i came out again upon gloom which wa half turn into
a greenish twilight by a multitud of small but steadi lamp below
they show mere the feet or fring of some huge and empti architectur
just in front of me wa someth that look like a mountain
i confess i nearli fell on the great stone platform on which i had emerg
to realiz that it wa an idol and worst of all an idol with
it back to me

it wa hardli half human i guessed; to judg by the small squat head
and still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turn up behind
and point like a loathsom larg finger at some symbol graven
in the centr of the vast stone back i had begun in the dim light
to guess at the hieroglyph not without horror when a more horribl
thing happen a door open silent in the templ wall
behind me and a man came out with a brown face and a black coat
he had a carv smile on hi face of copper flesh and ivori teeth;
but i think the most hate thing about him wa that he wa
in european dress i wa prepar i think for shroud priest
or nake fakir but thi seem to say that the devilri wa
over all the earth as inde i found it to be

`if you had onli seen the monkey feet he said smile steadili
and without other prefac `we should have been veri gentle--
you would onli be tortur and die if you had seen the monkey face
still we should be veri moder veri tolerant--y would onli
be tortur and live but as you have seen the monkey tail
we must pronounc the worst sentenc which is--go free

when he said the word i heard the elabor iron latch with
which i had struggl automat unlock itself: and then
far down the dark passag i had pass i heard the heavi street-door
shift it own bolt backward

`it is vain to ask for mercy; you must go free said
the smile man `henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword
and a breath shall bite you like an adder; weapon shall come
against you out of nowhere; and you shall die mani time
and with that he wa swallow onc more in the wall behind;
and i went out into the street

cray paused; and father brown unaffectedli sat down on the lawn
and began to pick daisi

then the soldier continued: putnam of cours with hi
jolli common sens pooh-pooh all my fears; and from that time
date hi doubt of my mental balanc well ill simpli tell you
in the fewest word the three thing that have happen since;
and you shall judg which of us is right

the first happen in an indian villag on the edg of the jungl
but hundr of mile from the templ or town or type of tribe
and custom where the curs had been put on me i woke in black midnight
and lay think of noth in particular when i felt a faint
tickl thing like a thread or a hair trail across my throat
i shrank back out of it way and could not help think of the word
in the templ but when i got up and sought light and a mirror
the line across my neck wa a line of blood

the second happen in a lodg in port said later
on our journey home togeth it wa a jumbl of tavern
and curiosity-shop; and though there wa noth there remot suggest
the cult of the monkey it is of cours possibl that some of it
imag or talisman were in such a place it curs wa there anyhow
i woke again in the dark with a sensat that could not be put
in colder or more liter word than that a breath bit like an adder
exist wa an agoni of extinction; i dash my head against wall
until i dash it against a window; and fell rather than jump
into the garden below putnam poor fellow who had call the other thing
a chanc scratch wa bound to take serious the fact of find me
half insens on the grass at dawn but i fear it wa my mental state
he took seriously; and not my stori

the third happen in malta we were in a fortress there;
and as it happen our bedroom overlook the open sea which almost
came up to our window-sil save for a flat white outer wall
as bare as the sea i woke up again; but it wa not dark
there wa a full moon as i walk to the window; i could have seen a bird
on the bare battlement or a sail on the horizon what i did see
wa a sort of stick or branch circl self-support in the empti sky
it flew straight in at my window and smash the lamp besid the pillow
i had just quit it wa one of those queer-shap war-club
some eastern tribe use but it had come from no human hand

father brown threw away a daisy-chain he wa make
and rose with a wist look ha major putnam he ask
got ani eastern curio idol weapon and so on from which
one might get a hint?

plenti of those though not much use i fear repli cray;
but by all mean come into hi studi

as they enter they pass miss watson button her glove for church
and heard the voic of putnam downstair still give a lectur on cookeri
to the cook in the major studi and den of curio they came suddenli
on a third parti silk-hat and dress for the street who wa
pore over an open book on the smoking-table--a book which he drop
rather guiltili and turn

cray introduc him civilli enough as dr oman but he show
such disfavour in hi veri face that brown guess the two men
whether audrey knew it or not were rival nor wa the priest
wholli unsympathet with the prejudic dr oman wa a veri well-dress
gentleman indeed; well-featur though almost dark enough for an asiat
but father brown had to tell himself sharpli that one should be in chariti
even with those who wax their point beard who have small glove hand
and who speak with perfectli modul voic

cray seem to find someth special irrit in
the small prayer-book in oman dark-glov hand i didnt know
that wa in your line he said rather rude

oman laugh mildli but without offenc thi is more so i know
he said lay hi hand on the big book he had drop
a dictionari of drug and such thing but it rather too larg
to take to church then he close the larger book and there seem
again the faintest touch of hurri and embarrass

i suppos said the priest who seem anxiou to chang the subject
all these spear and thing are from india?

from everywher answer the doctor putnam is an old soldier
and ha been in mexico and australia and the cannib island
for all i know

i hope it wa not in the cannib island said brown
that he learnt the art of cookeri and he ran hi eye over
the stew-pot or other strang utensil on the wall

at thi moment the jolli subject of their convers
thrust hi laugh lobsterish face into the room come along cray
he cri your lunch is just come in and the bell are ring
for those who want to go to church

cray slip upstair to change; dr oman and miss watson betook
themselv solemnli down the street with a string of other churchgoers;
but father brown notic that the doctor twice look back
and scrutin the house; and even came back to the corner of the street
to look at it again

the priest look puzzl he cant have been at the dustbin
he mutter not in those cloth or wa he there earlier today?

father brown touch other peopl wa as sensit as a barometer;
but today he seem about as sensit as a rhinocero by no social law
rigid or impli could he be suppos to linger round the lunch
of the anglo-indian friends; but he linger cover hi posit
with torrent of amus but quit needless convers
he wa the more puzzl becaus he did not seem to want ani lunch
as one after anoth of the most exquisit balanc kedgere of curri
accompani with their appropri vintag were laid befor
the other two he onli repeat that it wa one of hi fast-day
and munch a piec of bread and sip and then left untast
a tumbler of cold water hi talk howev wa exuber

ill tell you what ill do for you he cried-- ill mix you
a salad! i cant eat it but ill mix it like an angel!
youv got a lettuc there

unfortun it the onli thing we have got answer
the good-humour major you must rememb that mustard vinegar
oil and so on vanish with the cruet and the burglar

i know repli brown rather vagu that what ive alway
been afraid would happen that whi i alway carri a cruet-stand
about with me im so fond of salad

and to the amaz of the two men he took a pepper-pot out of
hi waistcoat pocket and put it on the tabl

i wonder whi the burglar want mustard too he went on
take a mustard-pot from anoth pocket a mustard plaster
i suppos and vinegar--and produc that condiment--
havent i heard someth about vinegar and brown paper?
as for oil which i think i put in my left--

hi garrul wa an instant arrested; for lift hi eye
he saw what no one els saw--th black figur of dr oman stand
on the sunlit lawn and look steadili into the room befor he could
quit recov himself cray had cloven in

your an astound card he said stare i shall come
and hear your sermon if theyr as amus as your manner
hi voic chang a littl and he lean back in hi chair

oh there are sermon in a cruet-stand too said father brown
quit grave have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard-seed;
or chariti that anoint with oil? and as for vinegar can ani soldier
forget that solitari soldier who when the sun wa darkened--

colonel cray lean forward a littl and clutch the tablecloth

father brown who wa make the salad tip two spoon
of the mustard into the tumbler of water besid him; stood up and said
in a new loud and sudden voice--drink that!

at the same moment the motionless doctor in the garden came run
and burst open a window cried: am i wanted? ha he been poisoned?

pretti near said brown with the shadow of a smile; for
the emet had veri suddenli taken effect and cray lay in a deck-chair
gasp as for life but aliv

major putnam had sprung up hi purpl face mottl a crime!
he cri hoars i will go for the police!

the priest could hear him drag down hi palm-leaf hat from the peg
and tumbl out of the front door; he heard the garden gate slam
but he onli stood look at cray; and after a silenc said quietly:

i shall not talk to you much; but i will tell you what
you want to know there is no curs on you the templ of the monkey
wa either a coincid or a part of the trick; the trick wa
the trick of a white man there is onli one weapon that will bring blood
with that mere featheri touch: a razor held by a white man
there is one way of make a common room full of invis
overpow poison: turn on the gas--th crime of a white man
and there is onli one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window
turn in mid-air and come back to the window next to it:
the australian boomerang youll see some of them in the major studi

with that he went outsid and spoke for a moment to the doctor
the moment after audrey watson came rush into the hous and
fell on her knee besid cray chair he could not hear what they said
to each other; but their face move with amaz not unhappi
the doctor and the priest walk slowli toward the garden gate

i suppos the major wa in love with her too he said with a sigh;
and when the other nod observed: you were veri gener doctor
you did a fine thing but what made you suspect?

a veri small thing said oman; but it kept me restless in church
till i came back to see that all wa well that book on hi tabl
wa a work on poisons; and wa put down open at the place where it state
that a certain indian poison though deadli and difficult to trace
wa particularli easili revers by the use of the commonest emet
i suppos he read that at the last moment--

and rememb that there were emet in the cruet-stand
said father brown exactli he threw the cruet in the dustbin--
where i found it along with other silver--for the sake of
a burglari blind but if you look at that pepper-pot i put on the tabl
youll see a small hole that where cray bullet struck
shake up the pepper and make the crimin sneez

there wa a silenc then dr oman said grimly: the major is
a long time look for the polic

or the polic in look for the major? said the priest
well good-by




xi the strang crime of john boulnoi


mr calhoun kidd wa a veri young gentleman with a veri old face
a face dri up with it own eager frame in blue-black hair
and a black butterfli tie he wa the emissari in england
of the coloss american daili call the western sun--
also humor describ as the rise sunset thi wa in allus
to a great journalist declar (attribut to mr kidd himself)
that he guess the sun would rise in the west yet if american citizen
did a bit more hustl those howev who mock american journal
from the standpoint of somewhat mellow tradit forget
a certain paradox which partli redeem it for while the journal
of the state permit a pantomim vulgar long past anyth english
it also show a real excit about the most earnest mental problem
of which english paper are innoc or rather incap
the sun wa full of the most solemn matter treat in the most
farcic way william jame figur there as well as weari willi
and pragmatist altern with pugilist in the long process
of it portrait

thu when a veri unobtrus oxford man name john boulnoi
wrote in a veri unread review call the natur philosophi quarterli
a seri of articl on alleg weak point in darwinian evolut
it flutter no corner of the english papers; though boulnoiss theori
(which wa that of a compar stationari univers visit occasion
by convuls of change) had some rather faddi fashion at oxford
and got so far as to be name catastroph but mani american paper
seiz on the challeng as a great event; and the sun threw
the shadow of mr boulnoi quit gigant across it page
by the paradox alreadi note articl of valuabl intellig and
enthusiasm were present with headlin appar written
by an illiter maniac headlin such as darwin chew dirt;
critic boulnoi say he jump the shocks--or keep catastroph
say thinker boulnoi and mr calhoun kidd of the western sun
wa bidden to take hi butterfli tie and lugubri visag down to
the littl hous outsid oxford where thinker boulnoi live
in happi ignor of such a titl

that fate philosoph had consent in a somewhat daze manner
to receiv the interview and had name the hour of nine that even
the last of a summer sunset clung about cumnor and the low wood hills;
the romant yanke wa both doubt of hi road and inquisit
about hi surroundings; and see the door of a genuin feudal
old-countri inn the champion arm stand open he went in
to make inquiri

in the bar parlour he rang the bell and had to wait
some littl time for a repli to it the onli other person present
wa a lean man with close red hair and loos horsey-look cloth
who wa drink veri bad whiski but smoke a veri good cigar
the whiski of cours wa the choic brand of the champion arms;
the cigar he had probabl brought with him from london
noth could be more differ than hi cynic neglig from
the dapper dryness of the young american; but someth in hi pencil
and open notebook and perhap in the express of hi alert blue eye
caus kidd to guess correctli that he wa a brother journalist

could you do me the favour ask kidd with the courtesi of
hi nation of direct me to the grey cottag where mr boulnoi live
as i understand?

it a few yard down the road said the red-hair man
remov hi cigar; i shall be pass it myself in a minut
but im go on to pendragon park to tri and see the fun

what is pendragon park? ask calhoun kidd

sir claud champion place--hav you come down for that too?
ask the other pressman look up your a journalist arent you?

i have come to see mr boulnoi said kidd

ive come to see mr boulnoi repli the other
but i shant catch her at home and he laugh rather unpleasantli

are you interest in catastrophism? ask the wonder yanke

im interest in catastrophes; and there are go to be some
repli hi companion gloomili mine a filthi trade
and i never pretend it isnt

with that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the veri act and
instant one could realiz that the man had been brought up as a gentleman

the american pressman consid him with more attent
hi face wa pale and dissip with the promis of formid passion
yet to be loosed; but it wa a clever and sensit face; hi cloth
were coars and careless but he had a good seal ring on one of hi long
thin finger hi name which came out in the cours of talk
wa jame dalroy; he wa the son of a bankrupt irish landlord
and attach to a pink paper which he heartili despis call
smart societi in the capac of report and of someth
pain like a spi

smart societi i regret to say felt none of that interest in
boulnoi on darwin which wa such a credit to the head and heart of
the western sun dalroy had come down it seem to snuff up
the scent of a scandal which might veri well end in the divorc court
but which wa at present hover between grey cottag and pendragon park

sir claud champion wa known to the reader of the western sun
as well as mr boulnoi so were the pope and the derbi winner;
but the idea of their intim acquaintanceship would have struck kidd
as equal incongru he had heard of (and written about
nay fals pretend to know) sir claud champion as
one of the brightest and wealthiest of england upper ten;
as the great sportsman who race yacht round the world;
as the great travel who wrote book about the himalaya
as the politician who swept constitu with a startl sort of
tori democraci and as the great dabbler in art music literatur
and abov all act sir claud wa realli rather magnific in
other than american eye there wa someth of the renasc princ
about hi omnivor cultur and restless publicity-- he wa not onli
a great amateur but an ardent one there wa in him none of that
antiquarian frivol that we convey by the word dilettant

that faultless falcon profil with purple-black italian eye
which had been snap-shot so often both for smart societi and
the western sun gave everyon the impress of a man eaten by ambit
as by a fire or even a diseas but though kidd knew a great deal
about sir claude--a great deal more in fact than there wa to know--
it would never have cross hi wildest dream to connect so showi
an aristocrat with the newly-unearth founder of catastroph
or to guess that sir claud champion and john boulnoi could be
intim friend such accord to dalroy account
wa nevertheless the fact the two had hunt in coupl at school
and colleg and though their social destini had been veri differ
(for champion wa a great landlord and almost a millionair
while boulnoi wa a poor scholar and until just late
an unknown one) they still kept in veri close touch with each other
inde boulnoiss cottag stood just outsid the gate of pendragon park

but whether the two men could be friend much longer wa becom
a dark and ugli question a year or two befor boulnoi had marri
a beauti and not unsuccess actress to whom he wa devot
in hi own shi and ponder style; and the proxim of the household
to champion had given that flighti celebr opportun for behav
in a way that could not but caus pain and rather base excit
sir claud had carri the art of public to perfection;
and he seem to take a crazi pleasur in be equal ostentati
in an intrigu that could do him no sort of honour footmen from
pendragon were perpetu leav bouquet for mr boulnois;
carriag and motor-car were perpetu call at the cottag
for mr boulnois; ball and masquerad perpetu fill the ground
in which the baronet parad mr boulnoi like the queen of
love and beauti at a tournament that veri even mark by mr
kidd for the exposit of catastroph had been mark by
sir claud champion for an open-air render of romeo and juliet
in which he wa to play romeo to a juliet it wa needless to name

i dont think it can go on without a smash said the young man
with red hair get up and shake himself old boulnoi may be
squared--or he may be squar but if he squar he thick--
what you might call cubic but i dont believ it possibl

he is a man of grand intellectu power said calhoun kidd
in a deep voic

ye answer dalroy; but even a man of grand intellectu power
cant be such a blight fool as all that must you be go on?
i shall be follow myself in a minut or two

but calhoun kidd have finish a milk and soda betook himself
smartli up the road toward the grey cottag leav hi cynic inform
to hi whiski and tobacco the last of the daylight had faded;
the sky were of a dark green-grey like slate stud here and there
with a star but lighter on the left side of the sky with the promis
of a rise moon

the grey cottag which stood entrench as it were in a squar
of stiff high thorn-hedg wa so close under the pine and palisad
of the park that kidd at first mistook it for the park lodg
find the name on the narrow wooden gate howev and see
by hi watch that the hour of the thinker appoint had just struck
he went in and knock at the front door insid the garden hedg
he could see that the hous though unpretenti enough wa larger
and more luxuri than it look at first and wa quit a differ kind
of place from a porter lodg a dog-kennel and a beehiv stood outsid
like symbol of old english country-life; the moon wa rise behind
a plantat of prosper pear tree the dog that came out of the kennel
wa reverend-look and reluct to bark; and the plain elderli
man-serv who open the door wa brief but dignifi

mr boulnoi ask me to offer hi apolog sir he said
but he ha been oblig to go out suddenli

but see here i had an appoint said the interview
with a rise voic do you know where he went to?

to pendragon park sir said the servant rather sombr
and began to close the door

kidd start a littl

did he go with mrs--with the rest of the party? he ask
rather vagu

no sir said the man shortly; he stay behind and then
went out alon and he shut the door brutal but with an air of
duti not done

the american that curiou compound of impud and sensit
wa annoy he felt a strong desir to hustl them all along a bit
and teach them busi habits; the hoari old dog and the grizzl
heavy-fac old butler with hi prehistor shirt-front and the drowsi
old moon and abov all the scatter-brain old philosoph who
couldnt keep an appoint

if that the way he goe on he deserv to lose hi wife
purest devot said mr calhoun kidd but perhap he gone over
to make a row in that case i reckon a man from the western sun
will be on the spot

and turn the corner by the open lodge-g he set off
stump up the long avenu of black pine-wood that point
in abrupt perspect toward the inner garden of pendragon park
the tree were as black and orderli as plume upon a hearse;
there were still a few star he wa a man with more literari
than direct natur associations; the word ravenswood came into
hi head repeatedli it wa partli the raven colour of the pine-woods;
but partli also an indescrib atmospher almost describ
in scott great tragedy; the smell of someth that die
in the eighteenth century; the smell of dank garden and broken urn
of wrong that will never now be righted; of someth that is
none the less incur sad becaus it is strang unreal

more than onc as he went up that strang black road
of tragic artific he stop startl think he heard step
in front of him he could see noth in front but the twin sombr
wall of pine and the wedg of starlit sky abov them at first
he thought he must have fanci it or been mock by a mere echo of
hi own tramp but as he went on he wa more and more inclin
to conclud with the remain of hi reason that there realli were
other feet upon the road he thought hazili of ghosts; and wa surpris
how swiftli he could see the imag of an appropri and local ghost
one with a face as white as pierrot but patch with black
the apex of the triangl of dark-blu sky wa grow brighter and bluer
but he did not realiz as yet that thi wa becaus he wa come
nearer to the light of the great hous and garden he onli felt
that the atmospher wa grow more intens there wa in the sad
more violenc and secrecy--more--h hesit for the word
and then said it with a jerk of laughter--catastroph

more pine more pathway slid past him and then he stood root
as by a blast of magic it is vain to say that he felt as if he had
got into a dream; but thi time he felt quit certain that he had
got into a book for we human be are use to inappropri things;
we are accustom to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune
to which we can go to sleep if one appropri thing happen
it wake us up like the pang of a perfect chord someth happen
such as would have happen in such a place in a forgotten tale

over the black pine-wood came fli and flash in the moon
a nake sword--such a slender and sparkl rapier as may have
fought mani an unjust duel in that ancient park it fell on the pathway
far in front of him and lay there glisten like a larg needl
he ran like a hare and bent to look at it seen at close quarter
it had rather a showi look: the big red jewel in the hilt and guard
were a littl dubiou but there were other red drop upon the blade
which were not dubiou

he look round wildli in the direct from which the dazzl missil
had come and saw that at thi point the sabl facad of fir and pine
wa interrupt by a smaller road at right angles; which when he turn it
brought him in full view of the long light hous with a lake and
fountain in front of it nevertheless he did not look at thi
have someth more interest to look at

abov him at the angl of the steep green bank of the
terrac garden wa one of those small picturesqu surpris
common in the old landscap gardening; a kind of small round hill or
dome of grass like a giant mole-hil ring and crown with
three concentr fenc of rose and have a sundial in the highest point
in the centr kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark
against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight
cling to that idl clock but he saw someth els cling
to it also for one wild moment--th figur of a man

though he saw it there onli for a moment though it wa outlandish
and incred in costum be clad from neck to heel in tight crimson
with glint of gold yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it wa
that white face flung up to heaven clean-shaven and so unnatur young
like byron with a roman nose those black curl alreadi grizzled--
he had seen the thousand public portrait of sir claud champion
the wild red figur reel an instant against the sundial; the next
it had roll down the steep bank and lay at the american feet
faintli move one arm a gaudi unnatur gold ornament on the arm
suddenli remind kidd of romeo and juliet; of cours the tight crimson
suit wa part of the play but there wa a long red stain down
the bank from which the man had rolled--that wa no part of the play
he had been run through the bodi

mr calhoun kidd shout and shout again onc more he seem
to hear phantasm footstep and start to find anoth figur
alreadi near him he knew the figur and yet it terrifi him
the dissip youth who had call himself dalroy had a horribl quiet
way with him; if boulnoi fail to keep appoint that had been made
dalroy had a sinist air of keep appoint that hadnt
the moonlight discolour everyth against dalroy red hair
hi wan face look not so much white as pale green

all thi morbid impression must be kidd excus for have
cri out brutal and beyond all reason: did you do thi you devil?

jame dalroy smile hi unpleas smile; but befor he could speak
the fallen figur made anoth movement of the arm wave vagu
toward the place where the sword fell; then came a moan and then
it manag to speak

boulnoi boulnoi i say boulnoi did it
jealou of mehe wa jealou he wa he wa

kidd bent hi head down to hear more and just manag
to catch the words:

boulnoiswith my own swordh threw it

again the fail hand wave toward the sword and then fell rigid
with a thud in kidd rose from it depth all that acrid humour
that is the strang salt of the serious of hi race

see here he said sharpli and with command you must
fetch a doctor thi man dead

and a priest too i suppos said dalroy in an undecipher manner
all these champion are papist

the american knelt down by the bodi felt the heart prop up
the head and use some last effort at restoration; but befor
the other journalist reappear follow by a doctor and a priest
he wa alreadi prepar to assert they were too late

were you too late also? ask the doctor a solid
prosperous-look man with convent moustach and whisker
but a live eye which dart over kidd dubious

in one sens drawl the repres of the sun
i wa too late to save the man but i guess i wa in time to hear
someth of import i heard the dead man denounc hi assassin

and who wa the assassin? ask the doctor draw hi
eyebrow togeth

boulnoi said calhoun kidd and whistl softli

the doctor stare at him gloomili with a redden brow--
but he did not contradict then the priest a shorter figur
in the background said mildly: i understood that mr boulnoi
wa not come to pendragon park thi even

there again said the yanke grimli i may be in a posit
to give the old countri a fact or two ye sir john boulnoi
wa go to stay in all thi evening; he fix up a real good appoint
there with me but john boulnoi chang hi mind; john boulnoi
left hi home abruptli and all alon and came over to thi darn park
an hour or so ago hi butler told me so i think we hold what
the all-wis polic call a clue--hav you sent for them?

ye said the doctor but we havent alarm anyon els yet

doe mr boulnoi know? ask jame dalroy and again kidd
wa consciou of an irrat desir to hit him on hi curl mouth

i have not told her said the doctor gruffly-- but here come
the polic

the littl priest had step out into the main avenu
and now return with the fallen sword which look ludicr larg
and theatric when attach to hi dumpi figur at onc cleric
and commonplac just befor the polic come he said apologet
ha anyon got a light?

the yanke journalist took an electr torch from hi pocket
and the priest held it close to the middl part of the blade
which he examin with blink care then without glanc at
the point or pommel he hand the long weapon to the doctor

i fear im no use here he said with a brief sigh
ill say good night to you gentlemen and he walk away
up the dark avenu toward the hous hi hand clasp behind him
and hi big head bent in cogit

the rest of the group made increas hast toward the lodge-g
where an inspector and two constabl could alreadi be seen
in consult with the lodge-keep but the littl priest
onli walk slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine and at last
stop dead on the step of the hous it wa hi silent way
of acknowledg an equal silent approach; for there came toward
him a presenc that might have satisfi even calhoun kidd demand
for a love and aristocrat ghost it wa a young woman
in silveri satin of a renasc design; she had golden hair
in two long shine rope and a face so startingli pale between them
that she might have been chryselephantine--mad that is like some
old greek statu out of ivori and gold but her eye were veri bright
and her voic though low wa confid

father brown? she said

mr boulnois? he repli grave then he look at her and
immedi said: i see you know about sir claud

how do you know i know? she ask steadili

he did not answer the question but ask another: have you
seen your husband?

my husband is at home she said he ha noth to do with thi

again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him
with a curious intens express on her face

shall i tell you someth more? she said with a rather
fear smile i dont think he did it and you dont either
father brown return her gaze with a long grave stare and then nod
yet more grave

father brown said the ladi i am go to tell you all i know
but i want you to do me a favour first will you tell me whi
you havent jump to the conclus of poor john guilt
as all the rest have done? dont mind what you say: i--i know about
the gossip and the appear that are against me

father brown look honestli embarrass and pass hi hand
across hi forehead two veri littl thing he said
at least one veri trivial and the other veri vagu
but such as they are they dont fit in with mr boulnoi
be the murder

he turn hi blank round face up to the star and
continu absentmindedly: to take the vagu idea first
i attach a good deal of import to vagu idea all those thing that
`arent evid are what convinc me i think a moral imposs
the biggest of all imposs i know your husband onli slightli
but i think thi crime of hi as gener conceiv someth
veri like a moral imposs pleas do not think i mean that
boulnoi could not be so wick anybodi can be wicked--a wick as
he choos we can direct our moral wills; but we cant gener chang
our instinct tast and way of do thing boulnoi might
commit a murder but not thi murder he would not snatch romeo sword
from it romant scabbard; or slay hi foe on the sundial as on
a kind of altar; or leav hi bodi among the rose or fling the sword
away among the pine if boulnoi kill anyon hed do it
quietli and heavili as hed do ani other doubt thing--
take a tenth glass of port or read a loos greek poet
no the romant set is not like boulnoi it more like champion

ah! she said and look at him with eye like diamond

and the trivial thing wa thi said brown there were
finger-print on that sword; finger-print can be detect quit
a time after they are made if theyr on some polish surfac
like glass or steel these were on a polish surfac
they were half-way down the blade of the sword whose print they were
i have no earthli clue; but whi should anybodi hold a sword half-way down?
it wa a long sword but length is an advantag in lung at an enemi
at least at most enemi at all enemi except one

except one she repeat

there is onli one enemi said father brown whom it is easier
to kill with a dagger than a sword

i know said the woman oneself

there wa a long silenc and then the priest said quietli
but abruptly: am i right then? did sir claud kill himself?

ye she said with a face like marbl i saw him do it

he die said father brown for love of you?

an extraordinari express flash across her face
veri differ from piti modesti remors or anyth her companion
had expected: her voic becam suddenli strong and full
i dont believ she said he ever care about me a rap
he hate my husband

why? ask the other and turn hi round face from the sky
to the ladi

he hate my husband becauseit is so strang i hardli know
how to say itbecaus

yes? said brown patient

becaus my husband wouldnt hate him

father brown onli nod and seem still to be listening;
he differ from most detect in fact and fiction in a small point--
he never pretend not to understand when he understood perfectli well

mr boulnoi drew near onc more with the same contain
glow of certainti my husband she said is a great man
sir claud champion wa not a great man: he wa a celebr and
success man my husband ha never been celebr or successful;
and it is the solemn truth that he ha never dream of be so
he no more expect to be famou for think than for smoke cigar
on all that side he ha a sort of splendid stupid he ha never
grown up he still like champion exactli as he like him at school;
he admir him as he would admir a conjur trick done at
the dinner-t but he couldnt be got to conceiv the notion of
envi champion and champion want to be envi he went mad
and kill himself for that

ye said father brown; i think i begin to understand

oh dont you see? she cried; the whole pictur is made for that--
the place is plan for it champion put john in a littl hous
at hi veri door like a dependant--to make him feel a failur
he never felt it he think no more about such thing than--
than an absent-mind lion champion would burst in on john
shabbiest hour or homeliest meal with some dazzl present or
announc or expedit that made it like the visit of haroun alraschid
and john would accept or refus amiabl with one eye off so to speak
like one lazi schoolboy agre or disagre with anoth
after five year of it john had not turn a hair; and sir claud champion
wa a monomaniac

and haman began to tell them said father brown
of all the thing wherein the king had honour him; and he said:
`all these thing profit me noth while i see mordecai the jew
sit in the gate

the crisi came mr boulnoi continu when i persuad john
to let me take down some of hi specul and send them to a magazin
they began to attract attent especi in america and one paper
want to interview him when champion (who wa interview
nearli everi day) heard of thi late littl crumb of success
fall to hi unconsci rival the last link snap that held back
hi devilish hatr then he began to lay that insan sieg to my own
love and honour which ha been the talk of the shire you will ask me
whi i allow such atroci attent i answer that i could not have
declin them except by explain to my husband and there are
some thing the soul cannot do as the bodi cannot fli
nobodi could have explain to my husband nobodi could do it now
if you said to him in so mani word `champion is steal your wife
he would think the joke a littl vulgar: that it could be anyth
but a joke--that notion could find no crack in hi great skull
to get in by well john wa to come and see us act thi even
but just as we were start he said he wouldnt; he had got
an interest book and a cigar i told thi to sir claud
and it wa hi death-blow the monomaniac suddenli saw despair
he stab himself cri out like a devil that boulnoi wa slay him;
he lie there in the garden dead of hi own jealousi to produc jealousi
and john is sit in the dining-room read a book

there wa anoth silenc and then the littl priest said:
there is onli one weak point mr boulnoi in all your
veri vivid account your husband is not sit in the dining-room
read a book that american report told me he had been to your hous
and your butler told him mr boulnoi had gone to pendragon park after all

her bright eye widen to an almost electr glare;
and yet it seem rather bewilder than confus or fear
whi what can you mean? she cri all the servant were
out of the hous see the theatric and we dont keep a butler
thank goodness!

father brown start and spun half round like an absurd teetotum
what what? he cri seem galvan into sudden life
look here--i say--can i make your husband hear if i go to the house?

oh the servant will be back by now she said wonder

right right! rejoin the cleric energet and set off
scuttl up the path toward the park gate he turn onc to say:
better get hold of that yanke or `crime of john boulnoi will be
all over the republ in larg letter

you dont understand said mr boulnoi he wouldnt mind
i dont think he imagin that america realli is a place

when father brown reach the hous with the beehiv and
the drowsi dog a small and neat maid-serv show him into
the dining-room where boulnoi sat read by a shade lamp
exactli as hi wife describ him a decant of port and a wineglass
were at hi elbow; and the instant the priest enter he note
the long ash stand out unbroken on hi cigar

he ha been here for half an hour at least thought father brown
in fact he had the air of sit where he had sat when hi dinner
wa clear away

dont get up mr boulnoi said the priest in hi pleasant
prosaic way i shant interrupt you a moment i fear i break in on
some of your scientif studi

no said boulnois; i wa read `the bloodi thumb
he said it with neither frown nor smile and hi visitor wa consciou
of a certain deep and viril indiffer in the man which hi wife
had call great he laid down a gori yellow shocker
without even feel it incongru enough to comment on it humor
john boulnoi wa a big slow-mov man with a massiv head
partli grey and partli bald and blunt burli featur
he wa in shabbi and veri old-fashion evening-dress with a narrow
triangular open of shirt-front: he had assum it that even
in hi origin purpos of go to see hi wife act juliet

i wont keep you long from `the bloodi thumb or ani other
catastroph affair said father brown smile i onli came
to ask you about the crime you commit thi even

boulnoi look at him steadili but a red bar began to show
across hi broad brow; and he seem like one discov embarrass
for the first time

i know it wa a strang crime assent brown in a low voic
stranger than murder perhaps--to you the littl sin are sometim
harder to confess than the big ones--but that whi it so import
to confess them your crime is commit by everi fashion hostess
six time a week: and yet you find it stick to your tongu like
a nameless atroc

it make one feel said the philosoph slowli such a
damn fool

i know assent the other but one often ha to choos
between feel a damn fool and be one

i cant analys myself well went on boulnois; but sit
in that chair with that stori i wa as happi as a schoolboy
on a half-holiday it wa secur eternity--i cant convey it
the cigar were within reachth match were within reach
the thumb had four more appear toit wa not onli a peac
but a plenitud then that bell rang and i thought for one long
mortal minut that i couldnt get out of that chair--liter
physic muscularli couldnt then i did it like a man
lift the world becaus i knew all the servant were out
i open the front door and there wa a littl man with hi mouth open
to speak and hi notebook open to write in i rememb the yanke
interview i had forgotten hi hair wa part in the middl
and i tell you that murder--

i understand said father brown ive seen him

i didnt commit murder continu the catastrophist mildli
but onli perjuri i said i had gone across to pendragon park
and shut the door in hi face that is my crime father brown
and i dont know what penanc you would inflict for it

i shant inflict ani penanc said the cleric gentleman
collect hi heavi hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement;
quit the contrari i came here special to let you off the littl
penanc which would otherwis have follow your littl offenc

and what ask boulnoi smile is the littl penanc
i have so luckili been let off?

be hang said father brown



xii the fairi tale of father brown


the picturesqu citi and state of heiligwaldenstein wa one of those
toy kingdom of which certain part of the german empir still consist
it had come under the prussian hegemoni quit late in history--
hardli fifti year befor the fine summer day when flambeau and
father brown found themselv sit in it garden and drink it beer
there had been not a littl of war and wild justic there within
live memori as soon will be shown but in mere look at it
one could not dismiss that impress of childish which is
the most charm side of germany--thos littl pantomim
patern monarchi in which a king seem as domest as a cook
the german soldier by the innumer sentry-box look strang like
german toy and the clean-cut battlement of the castl
gild by the sunshin look the more like the gilt gingerbread
for it wa brilliant weather the sky wa as prussian a blue as
potsdam itself could requir but it wa yet more like that lavish and
glow use of the colour which a child extract from a shill paint-box
even the grey-rib tree look young for the point bud on them
were still pink and in a pattern against the strong blue look like
innumer childish figur

despit hi prosaic appear and gener practic walk of life
father brown wa not without a certain streak of romanc in hi composit
though he gener kept hi daydream to himself as mani children do
amid the brisk bright colour of such a day and in the herald
framework of such a town he did feel rather as if he had enter
a fairi tale he took a childish pleasur as a younger brother might
in the formid sword-stick which flambeau alway flung as he walk
and which now stood upright besid hi tall mug of munich
nay in hi sleepi irrespons he even found himself eye the
knob and clumsi head of hi own shabbi umbrella with some
faint memori of the ogr club in a colour toy-book
but he never compos anyth in the form of fiction unless it be
the tale that follows:

i wonder he said whether one would have real adventur
in a place like thi if one put oneself in the way? it a splendid
back-scen for them but i alway have a kind of feel that they
would fight you with pasteboard sabr more than real horribl sword

you are mistaken said hi friend in thi place they
not onli fight with sword but kill without sword and there
wors than that

whi what do you mean? ask father brown

whi repli the other i should say thi wa the onli place
in europ where a man wa ever shot without firearm

do you mean a bow and arrow? ask brown in some wonder

i mean a bullet in the brain repli flambeau
dont you know the stori of the late princ of thi place?
it wa one of the great polic mysteri about twenti year ago
you rememb of cours that thi place wa forcibl annex
at the time of bismarck veri earliest scheme of consolidation--
forcibl that is but not at all easili the empir (or what want
to be one) sent princ otto of grossenmark to rule the place
in the imperi interest we saw hi portrait in the galleri there--
a handsom old gentleman if hed had ani hair or eyebrow
and hadnt been wrinkl all over like a vulture; but he had
thing to harass him as ill explain in a minut he wa a soldier
of distinguish skill and success but he didnt have altogeth
an easi job with thi littl place he wa defeat in sever battl
by the celebr arnhold brothers--th three guerrilla patriot
to whom swinburn wrote a poem you remember:

wolv with the hair of the ermin
crow that are crown and kings--
these thing be mani as vermin
yet three shall abid these thing

or someth of that kind inde it is by no mean certain
that the occup would ever have been success had not one of
the three brother paul despic but veri decis declin
to abid these thing ani longer and by surrend all the secret
of the insurrect ensur it overthrow and hi own ultim promot
to the post of chamberlain to princ otto after thi ludwig
the one genuin hero among mr swinburn hero wa kill
sword in hand in the captur of the city; and the third heinrich
who though not a traitor had alway been tame and even timid
compar with hi activ brother retir into someth like a hermitag
becam convert to a christian quietism which wa almost quakerish
and never mix with men except to give nearli all he had to the poor
they tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about
the neighbourhood occasion a man in a black cloak nearli blind
with veri wild white hair but a face of astonish soft

i know said father brown i saw him onc

hi friend look at him in some surpris i didnt know
youd been here befor he said perhap you know as much about it
as i do anyhow that the stori of the arnhold and he wa
the last survivor of them ye and of all the men who play part
in that drama

you mean that the princ too die long before?

die repeat flambeau and that about as much as we can say
you must understand that toward the end of hi life he began
to have those trick of the nerv not uncommon with tyrant
he multipli the ordinari daili and nightli guard round hi castl
till there seem to be more sentry-box than hous in the town
and doubt charact were shot without merci he live almost entir
in a littl room that wa in the veri centr of the enorm labyrinth
of all the other room and even in thi he erect anoth sort of
central cabin or cupboard line with steel like a safe or a battleship
some say that under the floor of thi again wa a secret hole in the earth
no more than larg enough to hold him so that in hi anxieti
to avoid the grave he wa will to go into a place pretti much like it
but he went further yet the populac had been suppos to be disarm
ever sinc the suppress of the revolt but otto now insist
as govern veri seldom insist on an absolut and liter disarma
it wa carri out with extraordinari thorough and sever
by veri well-organ offici over a small and familiar area and
so far as human strength and scienc can be absolut certain of anyth
princ otto wa absolut certain that nobodi could introduc so much as
a toy pistol into heiligwaldenstein

human scienc can never be quit certain of thing like that
said father brown still look at the red bud of the branch
over hi head if onli becaus of the difficulti about definit
and connot what is a weapon? peopl have been murder
with the mildest domest comforts; certainli with tea-kettl
probabl with tea-cosi on the other hand if you show
an ancient briton a revolv i doubt if he would know it wa a weapon--
until it wa fire into him of cours perhap somebodi introduc
a firearm so new that it didnt even look like a firearm
perhap it look like a thimbl or someth wa the bullet
at all peculiar?

not that i ever heard of answer flambeau; but my inform
is fragmentari and onli come from my old friend grimm
he wa a veri abl detect in the german servic and he tri
to arrest me; i arrest him instead and we had mani interest chat
he wa in charg here of the inquiri about princ otto but i forgot
to ask him anyth about the bullet accord to grimm
what happen wa thi he paus a moment to drain the greater part
of hi dark lager at a draught and then resumed:

on the even in question it seem the princ wa expect
to appear in one of the outer room becaus he had to receiv
certain visitor whom he realli wish to meet they were geolog
expert sent to investig the old question of the alleg suppli of gold
from the rock round here upon which (a it wa said) the small city-st
had so long maintain it credit and been abl to negoti with
it neighbour even under the ceaseless bombard of bigger armi
hitherto it had never been found by the most exact inquiri
which could--

which could be quit certain of discov a toy pistol
said father brown with a smile but what about the brother who ratted?
hadnt he anyth to tell the prince?

he alway assever that he did not know repli flambeau;
that thi wa the one secret hi brother had not told him
it is onli right to say that it receiv some support from
fragmentari words--spoken by the great ludwig in the hour of death
when he look at heinrich but point at paul and said
`you have not told him and wa soon afterward incap of speech
anyhow the deput of distinguish geologist and mineralogist
from pari and berlin were there in the most magnific and
appropri dress for there are no men who like wear their decor
so much as the men of science--a anybodi know who ha ever been to
a soire of the royal societi it wa a brilliant gather
but veri late and gradual the chamberlain--y saw hi portrait too:
a man with black eyebrow seriou eye and a meaningless sort of
smile underneath--th chamberlain i say discov there wa
everyth there except the princ himself he search all the
outer salons; then rememb the man mad fit of fear
hurri to the inmost chamber that also wa empti but the steel turret
or cabin erect in the middl of it took some time to open
when it did open it wa empti too he went and look into
the hole in the ground which seem deeper and somehow all the more
like a grave--that is hi account of cours and even as he did so
he heard a burst of cri and tumult in the long room
and corridor without

first it wa a distant din and thrill of someth unthink
on the horizon of the crowd even beyond the castl next it wa
a wordless clamour startlingli close and loud enough to be distinct
if each word had not kill the other next came word
of a terribl clear come nearer and next one man
rush into the room and tell the news as briefli as such news is told

otto princ of heiligwaldenstein and grossenmark wa lie
in the dew of the darken twilight in the wood beyond the castl
with hi arm flung out and hi face flung up to the moon
the blood still puls from hi shatter templ and jaw
but it wa the onli part of him that move like a live thing
he wa clad in hi full white and yellow uniform as to receiv hi
guest within except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay
rather crumpl by hi side befor he could be lift he wa dead
but dead or aliv he wa a riddle--h who had alway hidden in
the inmost chamber out there in the wet wood unarm and alon

who found hi body? ask father brown

some girl attach to the court name hedwig von someth or other
repli hi friend who had been out in the wood pick wild flower

had she pick any? ask the priest stare rather vacantli
at the veil of the branch abov him

ye repli flambeau i particularli rememb that
the chamberlain or old grimm or somebodi said how horribl it wa
when they came up at her call to see a girl hold spring flower
and bend over that--that bloodi collaps howev the main point is
that befor help arriv he wa dead and the news of cours
had to be carri back to the castl the constern it creat wa
someth beyond even that natur in a court at the fall of a potent
the foreign visitor especi the mine expert were in the wildest
doubt and excit as well as mani import prussian offici
and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for find the treasur
bulk much bigger in the busi than peopl had suppos
expert and offici had been promis great prize or
intern advantag and some even said that the princ
secret apart and strong militari protect were due less to fear
of the populac than to the pursuit of some privat investig of--

had the flower got long stalks? ask father brown

flambeau stare at him what an odd person you are! he said
that exactli what old grimm said he said the ugliest part of it
he thought--ugli than the blood and bullet--wa that the flower
were quit short pluck close under the head

of cours said the priest when a grown up girl is realli
pick flower she pick them with plenti of stalk if she just
pull their head off as a child doe it look as if--
and he hesit

well? inquir the other

well it look rather as if she had snatch them nervous
to make an excus for be there after--wel after she wa there

i know what your drive at said flambeau rather gloomili
but that and everi other suspicion break down on the one point--
the want of a weapon he could have been kill as you say
with lot of other things--even with hi own militari sash;
but we have to explain not bow he wa kill but how he wa shot
and the fact is we cant they had the girl most ruthlessli searched;
for to tell the truth she wa a littl suspect though the niec
and ward of the wick old chamberlain paul arnhold but she wa
veri romant and wa suspect of sympathi with the old revolutionari
enthusiasm in her famili all the same howev romant you are
you cant imagin a big bullet into a man jaw or brain without use
a gun or pistol and there wa no pistol though there were
two pistol shot i leav it to you my friend

how do you know there were two shots? ask the littl priest

there wa onli one in hi head said hi companion
but there wa anoth bullet-hol in the sash

father brown smooth brow becam suddenli constrict
wa the other bullet found? he demand

flambeau start a littl i dont think i rememb he said

hold on! hold on! hold on! cri brown frown more and more
with a quit unusu concentr of curios dont think me rude
let me think thi out for a moment

all right said flambeau laugh and finish hi beer
a slight breez stir the bud tree and blew up into the sky
cloudlet of white and pink that seem to make the sky bluer and
the whole colour scene more quaint they might have been cherub
fli home to the casement of a sort of celesti nurseri
the oldest tower of the castl the dragon tower stood up as grotesqu
as the ale-mug but as home onli beyond the tower glimmer
the wood in which the man had lain dead

what becam of thi hedwig eventually? ask the priest at last

she is marri to gener schwartz said flambeau
no doubt youv heard of hi career which wa rather romant
he had distinguish himself even befor hi exploit at sadowa
and gravelotte; in fact he rose from the rank which is veri unusu
even in the smallest of the german

father brown sat up suddenli

rose from the ranks! he cri and made a mouth as if to whistl
well well what a queer story! what a queer way of kill a man;
but i suppos it wa the onli one possibl but to think of hate
so patient--

what do you mean? demand the other in what way did they
kill the man?

they kill him with the sash said brown carefully; and then
as flambeau protested: ye ye i know about the bullet
perhap i ought to say he die of have a sash i know it doesnt sound
like have a diseas

i suppos said flambeau that youv got some notion
in your head but it wont easili get the bullet out of hi
as i explain befor he might easili have been strangl
but he wa shot by whom? by what?

he wa shot by hi own order said the priest

you mean he commit suicide?

i didnt say by hi own wish repli father brown
i said by hi own order

well anyhow what is your theory?

father brown laugh i am onli on my holiday he said
i havent got ani theori onli thi place remind me of fairi stori
and if you like ill tell you a stori

the littl pink cloud that look rather like sweet-stuff
had float up to crown the turret of the gilt gingerbread castl
and the pink babi finger of the bud tree seem spread and
stretch to reach them; the blue sky began to take a bright violet
of even when father brown suddenli spoke again:

it wa on a dismal night with rain still drop from the tree
and dew alreadi cluster that princ otto of grossenmark step
hurriedli out of a side door of the castl and walk swiftli
into the wood one of the innumer sentri salut him
but he did not notic it he had no wish to be special notic himself
he wa glad when the great tree grey and alreadi greasi with rain
swallow him up like a swamp he had deliber chosen
the least frequent side of hi palac but even that wa more frequent
than he like but there wa no particular chanc of offici
or diplomat pursuit for hi exit had been a sudden impuls
all the full-dress diplomatist he left behind were unimport
he had realiz suddenli that he could do without them

hi great passion wa not the much nobler dread of death
but the strang desir of gold for thi legend of the gold he had
left grossenmark and invad heiligwaldenstein for thi and onli thi
he had bought the traitor and butcher the hero for thi he had
long question and cross-quest the fals chamberlain
until he had come to the conclus that touch hi ignor
the renegad realli told the truth for thi he had somewhat reluctantli
paid and promis money on the chanc of gain the larger amount;
and for thi he had stolen out of hi palac like a thief in the rain
for he had thought of anoth way to get the desir of hi eye
and to get it cheap

away at the upper end of a rambl mountain path to which
he wa make hi way among the pillar rock along the ridg
that hang abov the town stood the hermitag hardli more than
a cavern fenc with thorn in which the third of the great brethren
had long hidden himself from the world he thought princ otto
could have no real reason for refus to give up the gold
he had known it place for year and made no effort to find it
even befor hi new ascet creed had cut him off from properti
or pleasur true he had been an enemi but he now profess
a duti of have no enemi some concess to hi caus
some appeal to hi principl would probabl get the mere money secret
out of him otto wa no coward in spite of hi network of militari
precaut and in ani case hi avaric wa stronger than hi fear
nor wa there much caus for fear sinc he wa certain there were
no privat arm in the whole princip he wa a hundr time
more certain there were none in the quaker littl hermitag on the hill
where he live on herb with two old rustic servant and with
no other voic of man for year after year princ otto look down
with someth of a grim smile at the bright squar labyrinth
of the lamp-lit citi below him for as far as the eye could see
there ran the rifl of hi friend and not one pinch of powder
for hi enemi rifl rank so close even to that mountain path
that a cri from him would bring the soldier rush up the hill
to say noth of the fact that the wood and ridg were patrol
at regular intervals; rifl so far away in the dim wood
dwarf by distanc beyond the river that an enemi could not
slink into the town by ani detour and round the palac rifl
at the west door and the east door at the north door and the south
and all along the four facad link them he wa safe

it wa all the more clear when he had crest the ridg
and found how nake wa the nest of hi old enemi he found himself
on a small platform of rock broken abruptli by the three corner
of precipic behind wa the black cave mask with green thorn
so low that it wa hard to believ that a man could enter it
in front wa the fall of the cliff and the vast but cloudi
vision of the valley on the small rock platform stood
an old bronz lectern or reading-stand groan under a great german bibl
the bronz or copper of it had grown green with the eat air
of that exalt place and otto had instantli the thought
even if they had arm they must be rust by now moonris had alreadi
made a deathli dawn behind the crest and crag and the rain had ceas

behind the lectern and look across the valley
stood a veri old man in a black robe that fell as straight as
the cliff around him but whose white hair and weak voic seem alik
to waver in the wind he wa evid read some daili lesson
as part of hi religi exercis they trust in their hors

`sir said the princ of heiligwaldenstein with quit unusu
courtesi `i should like onli one word with you

`and in their chariot went on the old man weakli
`but we will trust in the name of the lord of host
hi last word were inaud but he close the book rever and
be nearli blind made a grope movement and grip the reading-stand
instantli hi two servant slip out of the low-brow cavern
and support him they wore dull-black gown like hi own
but they had not the frosti silver on the hair nor the frost-bitten
refin of the featur they were peasant croat or magyar
with broad blunt visag and blink eye for the first time
someth troubl the princ but hi courag and diplomat sens
stood firm

`i fear we have not met he said `sinc that aw cannonad
in which your poor brother die

`all my brother die said the old man still look
across the valley then for one instant turn on otto hi droop
delic featur and the wintri hair that seem to drip
over hi eyebrow like icicl he added: `you see i am dead too

`i hope youll understand said the princ control himself
almost to a point of concili `that i do not come here to haunt you
as a mere ghost of those great quarrel we will not talk about
who wa right or wrong in that but at least there wa one point
on which we were never wrong becaus you were alway right
whatev is to be said of the polici of your famili no one for one moment
imagin that you were move by the mere gold; you have prove yourself
abov the suspicion that

the old man in the black gown had hitherto continu to gaze at him
with wateri blue eye and a sort of weak wisdom in hi face
but when the word `gold wa said he held out hi hand as if
in arrest of someth and turn away hi face to the mountain

`he ha spoken of gold he said `he ha spoken of
thing not law let him ceas to speak

otto had the vice of hi prussian type and tradit
which is to regard success not as an incid but as a qualiti
he conceiv himself and hi like as perpetu conquer peopl
who were perpetu be conquer consequ he wa ill acquaint
with the emot of surpris and ill prepar for the next movement
which startl and stiffen him he had open hi mouth
to answer the hermit when the mouth wa stop and the voic
strangl by a strong soft gag suddenli twist round hi head
like a tourniquet it wa fulli forti second befor he even realiz
that the two hungarian servant had done it and that they had done it
with hi own militari scarf

the old man went again weakli to hi great brazen-support bibl
turn over the leav with a patienc that had someth horribl
about it till he came to the epistl of st jame and then began to read:
`the tongu is a littl member but--

someth in the veri voic made the princ turn suddenli
and plung down the mountain-path he had climb he wa half-way toward
the garden of the palac befor he even tri to tear the strangl scarf
from hi neck and jaw he tri again and again and it wa impossible;
the men who had knot that gag knew the differ between
what a man can do with hi hand in front of him and what he can do
with hi hand behind hi head hi leg were free to leap like
an antelop on the mountain hi arm were free to use ani gestur
or wave ani signal but he could not speak a dumb devil wa in him

he had come close to the wood that wall in the castl
befor he had quit realiz what hi wordless state meant
and wa meant to mean onc more he look down grimli at the bright
squar labyrinth of the lamp-lit citi below him and he smile no more
he felt himself repeat the phrase of hi former mood with
a murder ironi far as the eye could see ran the rifl
of hi friend everi one of whom would shoot him dead
if he could not answer the challeng rifl were so near that
the wood and ridg could be patrol at regular intervals;
therefor it wa useless to hide in the wood till morn
rifl were rank so far away that an enemi could not slink
into the town by ani detour; therefor it wa vain to return to the citi
by ani remot cours a cri from him would bring hi soldier
rush up the hill but from him no cri would come

the moon had risen in strengthen silver and the sky show
in stripe of bright nocturn blue between the black stripe
of the pine about the castl flower of some wide and featheri sort--
for he had never notic such thing before--wer at onc lumin
and discolour by the moonshin and seem indescrib fantast
as they cluster as if crawl about the root of the tree
perhap hi reason had been suddenli unseat by the unnatur captiv
he carri with him but in that wood he felt someth
unfathom german--th fairi tale he knew with half hi mind
that he wa draw near to the castl of an ogre--h had forgotten
that he wa the ogr he rememb ask hi mother if bear live
in the old park at home he stoop to pick a flower as if it were
a charm against enchant the stalk wa stronger than he expect
and broke with a slight snap care tri to place it in hi scarf
he heard the halloo `who goe there? then he rememb the scarf
wa not in it usual place

he tri to scream and wa silent the second challeng came;
and then a shot that shriek as it came and then wa still suddenli
by impact otto of grossenmark lay veri peac among the fairi
tree and would do no more harm either with gold or steel; onli the
silver pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the
intric ornament of hi uniform or the old wrinkl on hi brow
may god have merci on hi soul

the sentri who had fire accord to the strict order
of the garrison natur ran forward to find some trace of hi quarri
he wa a privat name schwartz sinc not unknown in hi profess
and what he found wa a bald man in uniform but with hi face
so bandag by a kind of mask made of hi own militari scarf
that noth but open dead eye could be seen glitter stonili
in the moonlight the bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw;
that is whi there wa a shot-hol in the scarf but onli one shot
natur if not correctli young schwartz tore off the mysteri
silken mask and cast it on the grass; and then he saw whom he had slain

we cannot be certain of the next phase but i inclin to believ
that there wa a fairi tale after all in that littl wood
horribl as wa it occas whether the young ladi name hedwig
had ani previou knowledg of the soldier she save and eventu marri
or whether she came accident upon the accid and their intimaci
began that night we shall probabl never know but we can know
i fanci that thi hedwig wa a heroin and deserv to marri a man
who becam someth of a hero she did the bold and the wise thing
she persuad the sentri to go back to hi post in which place
there wa noth to connect him with the disaster; he wa but one of
the most loyal and orderli of fifti such sentri within call
she remain by the bodi and gave the alarm; and there wa noth
to connect her with the disast either sinc she had not got
and could not have ani firearm

well said father brown rise cheer i hope theyr happi

where are you going? ask hi friend

im go to have anoth look at that portrait of the chamberlain
the arnhold who betray hi brethren answer the priest
i wonder what part--i wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is
twice a traitor?

and he rumin long befor the portrait of a white-hair man
with black eyebrow and a pink paint sort of smile that seem
to contradict the black warn in hi eye
