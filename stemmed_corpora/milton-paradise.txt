of man first disobedi and the fruit
of that forbidden tree whose mortal tast
brought death into the world and all our woe
with loss of eden till one greater man
restor us and regain the bliss seat
sing heavenli muse that on the secret top
of oreb or of sinai didst inspir
that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
in the begin how the heaven and earth
rose out of chaos: or if sion hill
delight thee more and siloa brook that flow
fast by the oracl of god i thenc
invok thi aid to my adventur song
that with no middl flight intend to soar
abov th aonian mount while it pursu
thing unattempt yet in prose or rhyme
and chiefli thou o spirit that dost prefer
befor all templ th upright heart and pure
instruct me for thou knowst; thou from the first
wast present and with mighti wing outspread
dove-lik satst brood on the vast abyss
and madst it pregnant: what in me is dark
illumin what is low rais and support;
that to the height of thi great argument
i may assert etern provid
and justifi the way of god to men
say first--for heaven hide noth from thi view
nor the deep tract of hell--say first what caus
move our grand parent in that happi state
favour of heaven so highli to fall off
from their creator and transgress hi will
for one restraint lord of the world besid
who first seduc them to that foul revolt?
th infern serpent; he it wa whose guil
stir up with envi and reveng deceiv
the mother of mankind what time hi pride
had cast him out from heaven with all hi host
of rebel angel by whose aid aspir
to set himself in glori abov hi peer
he trust to have equal the most high
if he oppos and with ambiti aim
against the throne and monarchi of god
rais impiou war in heaven and battl proud
with vain attempt him the almighti power
hurl headlong flame from th ether sky
with hideou ruin and combust down
to bottomless perdit there to dwell
in adamantin chain and penal fire
who durst defi th omnipot to arm
nine time the space that measur day and night
to mortal men he with hi horrid crew
lay vanquish roll in the fieri gulf
confound though immort but hi doom
reserv him to more wrath; for now the thought
both of lost happi and last pain
torment him: round he throw hi bale eye
that wit huge afflict and dismay
mix with obdur pride and steadfast hate
at onc as far as angel ken he view
the dismal situat wast and wild
a dungeon horribl on all side round
as one great furnac flamed; yet from those flame
no light; but rather dark visibl
serv onli to discov sight of woe
region of sorrow dole shade where peac
and rest can never dwell hope never come
that come to all but tortur without end
still urg and a fieri delug fed
with ever-burn sulphur unconsum
such place etern justic ha prepar
for those rebellious; here their prison ordain
in utter dark and their portion set
as far remov from god and light of heaven
as from the centr thrice to th utmost pole
oh how unlik the place from whenc they fell!
there the companion of hi fall oerwhelm
with flood and whirlwind of tempestu fire
he soon discerns; and welter by hi side
one next himself in power and next in crime
long after known in palestin and name
beelzebub to whom th arch-enemi
and thenc in heaven call satan with bold word
break the horrid silenc thu began:--
if thou beest he--but o how fallen! how chang
from him who in the happi realm of light
cloth with transcend bright didst outshin
myriad though bright!--if he whom mutual leagu
unit thought and counsel equal hope
and hazard in the gloriou enterpris
join with me onc now miseri hath join
in equal ruin; into what pit thou seest
from what height fallen: so much the stronger prove
he with hi thunder; and till then who knew
the forc of those dire arms? yet not for those
nor what the potent victor in hi rage
can els inflict do i repent or chang
though chang in outward lustr that fix mind
and high disdain from sens of injur merit
that with the mightiest rais me to contend
and to the fierc content brought along
innumer forc of spirit arm
that durst dislik hi reign and me prefer
hi utmost power with advers power oppos
in dubiou battl on the plain of heaven
and shook hi throne what though the field be lost?
all is not lost--th unconquer will
and studi of reveng immort hate
and courag never to submit or yield:
and what is els not to be overcome?
that glori never shall hi wrath or might
extort from me to bow and sue for grace
with suppliant knee and deifi hi power
who from the terror of thi arm so late
doubt hi empire--that were low indeed;
that were an ignomini and shame beneath
thi downfall; sinc by fate the strength of god
and thi empyr sybstanc cannot fail;
sinc through experi of thi great event
in arm not wors in foresight much advanc
we may with more success hope resolv
to wage by forc or guil etern war
irreconcil to our grand foe
who now triumph and in th excess of joy
sole reign hold the tyranni of heaven
so spake th apost angel though in pain
vaunt aloud but rack with deep despair;
and him thu answer soon hi bold compeer:--
o princ o chief of mani throne power
that led th embattl seraphim to war
under thi conduct and in dread deed
fearless endang heaven perpetu king
and put to proof hi high supremaci
whether upheld by strength or chanc or fate
too well i see and rue the dire event
that with sad overthrow and foul defeat
hath lost us heaven and all thi mighti host
in horribl destruct laid thu low
as far as god and heavenli essenc
can perish: for the mind and spirit remain
invinc and vigour soon return
though all our glori extinct and happi state
here swallow up in endless miseri
but what if he our conqueror (whom i now
of forc believ almighti sinc no less
than such could have oerpow such forc as ours)
have left us thi our spirit and strength entir
strongli to suffer and support our pain
that we may so suffic hi veng ire
or do him mightier servic as hi thrall
by right of war whateer hi busi be
here in the heart of hell to work in fire
or do hi errand in the gloomi deep?
what can it the avail though yet we feel
strength undiminish or etern be
to undergo etern punishment?
whereto with speedi word th arch-fiend replied:--
fallen cherub to be weak is miser
do or suffering: but of thi be sure--
to do aught good never will be our task
but ever to do ill our sole delight
as be the contrari to hi high will
whom we resist if then hi provid
out of our evil seek to bring forth good
our labour must be to pervert that end
and out of good still to find mean of evil;
which ofttim may succeed so as perhap
shall griev him if i fail not and disturb
hi inmost counsel from their destin aim
but see! the angri victor hath recal
hi minist of vengeanc and pursuit
back to the gate of heaven: the sulphur hail
shot after us in storm oerblown hath laid
the fieri surg that from the precipic
of heaven receiv us falling; and the thunder
wing with red lightn and impetu rage
perhap hath spent hi shaft and ceas now
to bellow through the vast and boundless deep
let us not slip th occas whether scorn
or satiat furi yield it from our foe
seest thou yon dreari plain forlorn and wild
the seat of desol void of light
save what the glimmer of these livid flame
cast pale and dreadful? thither let us tend
from off the toss of these fieri waves;
there rest if ani rest can harbour there;
and re-assembl our afflict power
consult how we may henceforth most offend
our enemi our own loss how repair
how overcom thi dire calam
what reinforc we may gain from hope
if not what resolut from despair
thu satan talk to hi nearest mate
with head uplift abov the wave and eye
that sparkl blazed; hi other part besid
prone on the flood extend long and larg
lay float mani a rood in bulk as huge
as whom the fabl name of monstrou size
titanian or earth-born that war on jove
briareo or typhon whom the den
by ancient tarsu held or that sea-beast
leviathan which god of all hi work
creat hugest that swim th ocean-stream
him hapli slumber on the norway foam
the pilot of some small night-found skiff
deem some island oft as seamen tell
with fix anchor in hi scali rind
moor by hi side under the lee while night
invest the sea and wish morn delay
so stretch out huge in length the arch-fiend lay
chain on the burn lake; nor ever thenc
had risen or heav hi head but that the will
and high permiss of all-rul heaven
left him at larg to hi own dark design
that with reiter crime he might
heap on himself damnat while he sought
evil to other and enrag might see
how all hi malic serv but to bring forth
infinit good grace and merci shewn
on man by him seduc but on himself
trebl confus wrath and vengeanc pour
forthwith upright he rear from off the pool
hi mighti stature; on each hand the flame
driven backward slope their point spire androl
in billow leav i th midst a horrid vale
then with expand wing he steer hi flight
aloft incumb on the duski air
that felt unusu weight; till on dri land
he lights--if it were land that ever burn
with solid as the lake with liquid fire
and such appear in hue as when the forc
of subterranean wind transprot a hill
torn from peloru or the shatter side
of thunder etna whose combust
and fuell entrail thenc conceiv fire
sublim with miner furi aid the wind
and leav a sing bottom all involv
with stench and smoke such rest found the sole
of unblest feet him follow hi next mate;
both glori to have scape the stygian flood
as god and by their own recov strength
not by the suffer of supern power
is thi the region thi the soil the clime
said then the lost archangel thi the seat
that we must chang for heaven?--thi mourn gloom
for that celesti light? be it so sinc he
who now is sovereign can dispos and bid
what shall be right: farthest from him is best
whom reason hath equal forc hath made suprem
abov hi equal farewel happi field
where joy for ever dwells! hail horrors! hail
infern world! and thou profoundest hell
receiv thi new possessor--on who bring
a mind not to be chang by place or time
the mind is it own place and in itself
can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven
what matter where if i be still the same
and what i should be all but less than he
whom thunder hath made greater? here at least
we shall be free; th almighti hath not built
here for hi envi will not drive us hence:
here we may reigh secure; and in my choic
to reign is worth ambit though in hell:
better to reign in hell than serv in heaven
but wherefor let we then our faith friend
th associ and co-partn of our loss
lie thu astonish on th oblivi pool
and call them not to share with us their part
in thi unhappi mansion or onc more
with ralli arm to tri what may be yet
regain in heaven or what more lost in hell?
so satan spake; and him beelzebub
thu answered:--lead of those armi bright
which but th omnipot none could have foiled!
if onc they hear that voic their liveliest pledg
of hope in fear and dangers--heard so oft
in worst extrem and on the peril edg
of battl when it rage in all assault
their surest signal--they will soon resum
new courag and reviv though now they lie
grovel and prostrat on yon lake of fire
as we erewhil astound and amazed;
no wonder fallen such a pernici height!
he scare had ceas when the superior fiend
wa move toward the shore; hi ponder shield
ether temper massi larg and round
behind him cast the broad circumfer
hung on hi shoulder like the moon whose orb
through optic glass the tuscan artist view
at even from the top of fesol
or in valdarno to descri new land
river or mountain in her spotti globe
hi spear--to equal which the tallest pine
hewn on norwegian hill to be the mast
of some great ammir were but a wand--
he walk with to support uneasi step
over the burn marl not like those step
on heaven azure; and the torrid clime
smote on him sore besid vault with fire
nathless he so endur till on the beach
of that inflam sea he stood and call
hi legions--angel form who lay entranc
thick as autumn leav that strow the brook
in vallombrosa where th etrurian shade
high over-arch embower; or scatter sedg
afloat when with fierc wind orion arm
hath vex the red-sea coast whose wave oerthrew
busiri and hi memphian chivalri
while with perfidi hatr they pursu
the sojourn of goshen who beheld
from the safe shore their float carcas
and broken chariot-wheel so thick bestrown
abject and lost lay these cover the flood
under amaz of their hideou chang
he call so loud that all the hollow deep
of hell resounded:--princ potent
warrior the flower of heaven--onc yours; now lost
if such astonish as thi can seiz
etern spirits! or have ye chosen thi place
after the toil of battl to repos
your weari virtu for the eas you find
to slumber here as in the vale of heaven?
or in thi abject postur have ye sworn
to ador the conqueror who now behold
cherub and seraph roll in the flood
with scatter arm and ensign till anon
hi swift pursuer from heaven-g discern
th advantag and descend tread us down
thu droop or with link thunderbolt
transfix us to the bottom of thi gulf?
awak aris or be for ever fallen!
they heard and were abash and up they sprung
upon the wing as when men wont to watch
on duti sleep found by whom they dread
rous and bestir themselv ere well awak
nor did they not perceiv the evil plight
in which they were or the fierc pain not feel;
yet to their gener voic they soon obey
innumer as when the potent rod
of amram son in egypt evil day
wave round the coast up-cal a pitchi cloud
of locust warp on the eastern wind
that oer the realm of impiou pharaoh hung
like night and darken all the land of nile;
so numberless were those bad angel seen
hover on wing under the cope of hell
twixt upper nether and surround fires;
till as a signal given th uplift spear
of their great sultan wave to direct
their cours in even balanc down they light
on the firm brimston and fill all the plain:
a multitud like which the popul north
pour never from her frozen loin to pass
rhene or the danaw when her barbar son
came like a delug on the south and spread
beneath gibraltar to the libyan sand
forthwith form everi squadron and each band
the head and leader thither hast where stood
their great commander--godlik shape and form
excel human; princ dignities;
and power that erst in heaven sat on throne
though on their name in heavenli record now
be no memori blot out and rase
by their rebellion from the book of life
nor had they yet among the son of eve
got them new name till wander oer the earth
through god high suffer for the trial of man
by falsiti and lie the greatest part
of mankind they corrupt to forsak
god their creator and th invis
glori of him that made them to transform
oft to the imag of a brute adorn
with gay religion full of pomp and gold
and devil to ador for deities:
then were they known to men by variou name
and variou idol through the heathen world
say muse their name then known who first who last
rous from the slumber on that fieri couch
at their great emperor call as next in worth
came singli where he stood on the bare strand
while the promiscu crowd stood yet aloof?
the chief were those who from the pit of hell
roam to seek their prey on earth durst fix
their seat long after next the seat of god
their altar by hi altar god ador
among the nation round and durst abid
jehovah thunder out of sion throne
between the cherubim; yea often place
within hi sanctuari itself their shrine
abominations; and with curs thing
hi holi rite and solemn feast profan
and with their dark durst affront hi light
first moloch horrid king besmear with blood
of human sacrific and parent tears;
though for the nois of drum and timbrel loud
their children cri unheard that pass through fire
to hi grim idol him the ammonit
worship in rabba and her wateri plain
in argob and in basan to the stream
of utmost arnon nor content with such
audaci neighbourhood the wisest heart
of solomon he led by fraoud to build
hi templ right against the templ of god
on that opprobri hill and made hi grove
the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thenc
and black gehenna call the type of hell
next chemo th obscen dread of moab son
from aroar to nebo and the wild
of southmost abarim; in hesebon
and horonaim seon real beyond
the floweri dale of sibma clad with vine
and eleal to th asphalt pool:
peor hi other name when he entic
israel in sittim on their march from nile
to do him wanton rite which cost them woe
yet thenc hi lust orgi he enlarg
even to that hill of scandal by the grove
of moloch homicid lust hard by hate
till good josiah drove them thenc to hell
with these came they who from the border flood
of old euphrat to the brook that part
egypt from syrian ground had gener name
of baalim and ashtaroth--thos male
these feminin for spirit when they pleas
can either sex assum or both; so soft
and uncompound is their essenc pure
not tri or manacl with joint or limb
nor found on the brittl strength of bone
like cumbrou flesh; but in what shape they choos
dilat or condens bright or obscur
can execut their airi purpos
and work of love or enmiti fulfil
for those the race of israel oft forsook
their live strength and unfrequ left
hi righteou altar bow lowli down
to bestial gods; for which their head as low
bow down in battl sunk befor the spear
of despic foe with these in troop
came astoreth whom the phoenician call
astart queen of heaven with crescent horns;
to whose bright imag nigntli by the moon
sidonian virgin paid their vow and songs;
in sion also not unsung where stood
her templ on th offens mountain built
by that uxori king whose heart though larg
beguil by fair idolatress fell
to idol foul thammuz came next behind
whose annual wound in lebanon allur
the syrian damsel to lament hi fate
in amor ditti all a summer day
while smooth adoni from hi nativ rock
ran purpl to the sea suppos with blood
of thammuz yearli wounded: the love-tal
infect sion daughter with like heat
whose wanton passion in the sacr proch
ezekiel saw when by the vision led
hi eye survey the dark idolatri
of alien judah next came one
who mourn in earnest when the captiv ark
maim hi brute imag head and hand lopt off
in hi own templ on the grunsel-edg
where he fell flat and shame hi worshippers:
dagon hi name sea-monsterupward man
and downward fish; yet had hi templ high
rear in azotu dread through the coast
of palestin in gath and ascalon
and accaron and gaza frontier bound
him follow rimmon whose delight seat
wa fair damascu on the fertil bank
of abbana and pharphar lucid stream
he also against the hous of god wa bold:
a leper onc he lost and gain a king--
ahaz hi sottish conqueror whom he drew
god altar to disparag and displac
for one of syrian mode whereon to burn
hi odiou offer and ador the god
whom he had vanquish after these appear
a crew who under name of old renown--
osiri isi oru and their train--
with monstrou shape and sorceri abus
fanat egypt and her priest to seek
their wander god disguis in brutish form
rather than human nor did israel scape
th infect when their borrow gold compos
the calf in oreb; and the rebel king
doubl that sin in bethel and in dan
liken hi maker to the graze ox--
jehovah who in one night when he pass
from egypt march equal with one stroke
both her first-born and all her bleat god
belial came last; than whom a spirit more lewd
fell not from heaven or more gross to love
vice for itself to him no templ stood
or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he
in templ and at altar when the priest
turn atheist as did eli son who fill
with lust and violenc the hous of god?
in court and palac he also reign
and in luxuri citi where the nois
of riot ascend abov their loftiest tower
and injuri and outrage; and when night
darken the street then wander forth the son
of belial flown with insol and wine
wit the street of sodom and that night
in gibeah when the hospit door
expos a matron to avoid wors rape
these were the prime in order and in might:
the rest were long to tell; though far renown
th ionian gods--of javan issu held
god yet confess later than heaven and earth
their boast parents;--titan heaven first-born
with hi enorm brood and birthright seiz
by younger saturn: he from mightier jove
hi own and rhea son like measur found;
so jove usurp reign these first in crete
and ida known thenc on the snowi top
of cold olympu rule the middl air
their highest heaven; or on the delphian cliff
or in dodona and through all the bound
of doric land; or who with saturn old
fled over adria to th hesperian field
and oer the celtic roam the utmost isl
all these and more came flocking; but with look
downcast and damp; yet such wherein appear
obscur some glimps of joy to have found their chief
not in despair to have found themselv not lost
in loss itself; which on hi counten cast
like doubt hue but he hi wont pride
soon recollect with high word that bore
semblanc of worth not substanc gentli rais
their faint courag and dispel their fear
then straight command that at the warlik sound
of trumpet loud and clarion be uprear
hi mighti standard that proud honour claim
azazel as hi right a cherub tall:
who forthwith from the glitter staff unfurl
th imperi ensign; which full high advanc
shone like a meteor stream to the wind
with gem and golden lustr rich emblaz
seraph arm and trophies; all the while
sonor metal blow martial sounds:
at which the univers host up-sent
a shout that tore hell concav and beyond
fright the reign of chao and old night
all in a moment through the gloom were seen
ten thousand banner rise into the air
with orient colour waving: with them rose
a forest huge of spears; and throng helm
appear and serri shield in thick array
of depth immeasur anon they move
in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood
of flute and soft recorders--such as rais
to height of noblest temper hero old
arm to battl and instead of rage
deliber valour breath firm and unmov
with dread of death to flight or foul retreat;
nor want power to mitig and swage
with solemn touch troubl thought and chase
anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
from mortal or immort mind thu they
breath unit forc with fix thought
move on in silenc to soft pipe that charm
their pain step oer the burnt soil and now
advanc in view they stand--a horrid front
of dread length and dazzl arm in guis
of warrior old with order spear and shield
await what command their mighti chief
had to impos he through the arm file
dart hi experienc eye and soon travers
the whole battalion views--their order due
their visag and statur as of gods;
their number last he sum and now hi heart
distend with pride and harden in hi strength
glories: for never sinc creat man
met such embodi forc as name with these
could merit more than that small infantri
war on by cranes--though all the giant brood
of phlegra with th heroic race were join
that fought at thebe and ilium on each side
mix with auxiliar gods; and what resound
in fabl or romanc of uther son
begirt with british and armor knights;
and all who sinc baptiz or infidel
joust in aspramont or montalban
damasco or marocco or trebisond
or whom biserta sent from afric shore
when charlemain with all hi peerag fell
by fontarabbia thu far these beyond
compar of mortal prowess yet observ
their dread command he abov the rest
in shape and gestur proudli emin
stood like a tower hi form had yet not lost
all her origin bright nor appear
less than archangel ruin and th excess
of glori obscured: as when the sun new-risen
look through the horizont misti air
shorn of hi beam or from behind the moon
in dim eclips disastr twilight shed
on half the nation and with fear of chang
perplex monarch darken so yet shone
abov them all th archangel: but hi face
deep scar of thunder had intrench and care
sat on hi fade cheek but under brow
of dauntless courag and consider pride
wait reveng cruel hi eye but cast
sign of remors and passion to behold
the fellow of hi crime the follow rather
(far other onc beheld in bliss) condemn
for ever now to have their lot in pain--
million of spirit for hi fault amerc
of heaven and from eteranl splendour flung
for hi revolt--yet faith how they stood
their glori withered; as when heaven fire
hath scath the forest oak or mountain pine
with sing top their state growth though bare
stand on the blast heath he now prepar
to speak; whereat their doubl rank they bend
from wing to wing and half enclos him round
with all hi peers: attent held them mute
thrice he assay and thrice in spite of scorn
tear such as angel weep burst forth: at last
word interwov with sigh found out their way:--
o myriad of immort spirits! o power
matchless but with th almighth!--and that strife
wa not inglori though th event wa dire
as thi place testifi and thi dire chang
hate to utter but what power of mind
forse or presag from the depth
of knowledg past or present could have fear
how such unit forc of god how such
as stood like these could ever know repulse?
for who can yet believ though after loss
that all these puissant legion whose exil
hath empti heaven shall fail to re-ascend
self-rais and repossess their nativ seat?
for me be wit all the host of heaven
if counsel differ or danger shun
by me have lost our hope but he who reign
monarch in heaven till then as one secur
sat on hi throne upheld by old reput
consent or custom and hi regal state
put forth at full but still hi strength concealed--
which tempt our attempt and wrought our fall
henceforth hi might we know and know our own
so as not either to provok or dread
new war provoked: our better part remain
to work in close design by fraud or guil
what forc effect not; that he no less
at length from us may find who overcom
by forc hath overcom but half hi foe
space may produc new worlds; whereof so rife
there went a fame in heaven that he ere long
intend to creat and therein plant
a gener whom hi choic regard
should favour equal to the son of heaven
thither if but to pri shall be perhap
our first eruption--thith or elsewhere;
for thi infern pit shall never hold
celesti spirit in bondag nor th abyss
long under dark cover but these thought
full counsel must matur peac is despaired;
for who can think submission? war then war
open or understood must be resolv
he spake; and to confirm hi word outflew
million of flame sword drawn from the thigh
of mighti cherubim; the sudden blaze
far round illumin hell highli they rage
against the highest and fierc with grasp arm
clash on their sound shield the din of war
hurl defianc toward the vault of heaven
there stood a hill not far whose grisli top
belch fire and roll smoke; the rest entir
shone with a glossi scurf--undoubt sign
that in hi womb wa hid metal ore
the work of sulphur thither wing with speed
a numer brigad hastened: as when band
of pioneer with spade and pickax arm
forerun the royal camp to trench a field
or cast a rampart mammon led them on--
mammon the least erect spirit that fell
from heaven; for even in heaven hi look and thought
were alway downward bent admir more
the rich of heaven pavement trodden gold
than aught divin or holi els enjoy
in vision beatif by him first
men also and by hi suggest taught
ransack the centr and with impiou hand
rifl the bowel of their mother earth
for treasur better hid soon had hi crew
open into the hill a spaciou wound
and dig out rib of gold let none admir
that rich grow in hell; that soil may best
deserv the preciou bane and here let those
who boast in mortal thing and wonder tell
of babel and the work of memphian king
learn how their greatest monument of fame
and strength and art are easili outdon
by spirit reprob and in an hour
what in an age they with incess toil
and hand innumer scarc perform
nigh on the plain in mani cell prepar
that underneath had vein of liquid fire
sluic from the lake a second multitud
with wondrou art found the massi ore
sever each kind and scum the bullion-dross
a third as soon had form within the ground
a variou mould and from the boil cell
by strang convey fill each hollow nook;
as in an organ from one blast of wind
to mani a row of pipe the sound-board breath
anon out of the earth a fabric huge
rose like an exhal with the sound
of dulcet symphoni and voic sweet--
built like a templ where pilast round
were set and doric pillar overlaid
with golden architrave; nor did there want
cornic or friez with bossi sculptur graven;
the roof wa fret gold not babylon
nor great alcairo such magnific
equal in all their glori to enshrin
belu or serapi their god or seat
their king when egypt with assyria strove
in wealth and luxuri th ascend pile
stood fix her state height and straight the door
open their brazen fold discov wide
within her ampl space oer the smooth
and level pavement: from the arch roof
pendent by subtl magic mani a row
of starri lamp and blaze cresset fed
with naptha and asphaltu yield light
as from a sky the hasti multitud
admir entered; and the work some prais
and some the architect hi hand wa known
in heaven by mani a tower structur high
where sceptr angel held their resid
and sat as princ whom the suprem king
exalt to such power and gave to rule
each in hi hierarchi the order bright
nor wa hi name unheard or unador
in ancient greece; and in ausonian land
men call him mulciber; and how he fell
from heaven they fabl thrown by angri jove
sheer oer the crystal battlements: from morn
to noon he fell from noon to dewi eve
a summer day and with the set sun
dropt from the zenith like a fall star
on lemno th aegaean isl thu they relat
erring; for he with thi rebelli rout
fell long before; nor aught avil him now
to have built in heaven high towers; nor did he scape
by all hi engin but wa headlong sent
with hi industri crew to build in hell
meanwhil the wing herald by command
of sovereign power with aw ceremoni

a solemn council forthwith to be held
at pandemonium the high capit

from everi band and squar regiment
by place or choic the worthiest: they anon

(though like a cover field where champion bold
wont ride in arm and at the soldan chair
defi the best of paynim chivalri
to mortal combat or career with lance)
thick swarm both on the ground and in the air
brush with the hiss of rustl wing as bee

pour forth their popul youth about the hive
in clusters; they among fresh dew and flower
fli to and fro or on the smooth plank

new rub with balm expati and confer
their state-affairs: so thick the airi crowd
swarm and were straitened; till the signal given
behold a wonder! they but now who seem
in big to surpass earth giant son
now less than smallest dwarf in narrow room
throng numberless--lik that pygmean race

of that infern court but far within

high on a throne of royal state which far
outshon the wealth or ormu and of ind
or where the gorgeou east with richest hand
shower on her king barbar pearl and gold
satan exalt sat by merit rais
to that bad eminence; and from despair
thu high uplift beyond hope aspir
beyond thu high insati to pursu
vain war with heaven; and by success untaught
hi proud imagin thu displayed:--
power and dominion deiti of heaven!--
for sinc no deep within her gulf can hold
immort vigour though oppress and fallen
i give not heaven for lost: from thi descent
celesti virtu rise will appear
more gloriou and more dread than from no fall
and trust themselv to fear no second fate!--
me though just right and the fix law of heaven
did first creat your leader--next free choic
with what besid in council or in fight
hath been achiev of merit--yet thi loss
thu far at least recov hath much more
establish in a safe unenvi throne
yield with full consent the happier state
in heaven which follow digniti might draw
envi from each inferior; but who here
will envi whom the highest place expos
foremost to stand against the thunder aim
your bulwark and condemn to greatest share
of endless pain? where there is then no good
for which to strive no strife can grow up there
from faction: for none sure will claim in hell
precedence; none whose portion is so small
of present pain that with ambiti mind
will covet more! with thi advantag then
to union and firm faith and firm accord
more than can be in heaven we now return
to claim our just inherit of old
surer to prosper than prosper
could have assur us; and by what best way
whether of open war or covert guil
we now debat who can advis may speak
he ceased; and next him moloch sceptr king
stood up--th strongest and the fiercest spirit
that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair
hi trust wa with th etern to be deem
equal in strength and rather than be less
care not to be at all; with that care lost
went all hi fear: of god or hell or wors
he reck not and these word thereaft spake:--
my sentenc is for open war of wile
more unexpert i boast not: them let those
contriv who need or when they need; not now
for while they sit contriv shall the rest--
million that stand in arm and long wait
the signal to ascend--sit linger here
heaven fugit and for their dwelling-plac
accept thi dark opprobri den of shame
the prison of hi ryranni who reign
by our delay? no! let us rather choos
arm with hell-flam and furi all at onc
oer heaven high tower to forc resistless way
turn our tortur into horrid arm
against the torturer; when to meet the nois
of hi almighti engin he shall hear
infern thunder and for lightn see
black fire and horror shot with equal rage
among hi angel and hi throne itself
mix with tartarean sulphur and strang fire
hi own invent torment but perhap
the way seem difficult and steep to scale
with upright wing against a higher foe!
let such bethink them if the sleepi drench
of that forget lake benumb not still
that in our porper motion we ascend
up to our nativ seat; descent and fall
to us is advers who but felt of late
when the fierc foe hung on our broken rear
insult and pursu us through the deep
with what compuls and labori flight
we sunk thu low? th ascent is easi then;
th event is feared! should we again provok
our stronger some wors way hi wrath may find
to our destruct if there be in hell
fear to be wors destroyed! what can be wors
than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemn
in thi abhor deep to utter woe!
where pain of unextinguish fire
must exercis us without hope of end
the vassal of hi anger when the scourg
inexor and the tortur hour
call us to penance? more destroy than thu
we should be quit abolish and expir
what fear we then? what doubt we to incens
hi utmost ire? which to the height enrag
will either quit consum us and reduc
to noth thi essential--happi far
than miser to have etern being!--
or if our substanc be inde divin
and cannot ceas to be we are at worst
on thi side nothing; and by proof we feel
our power suffici to disturb hi heaven
and with perpetu inroad to alarm
though inaccess hi fatal throne:
which if not victori is yet reveng
he end frown and hi look denounc
desper reveng and battl danger
to less than god on th other side up rose
belial in act more grace and human
a fairer person lost not heaven; he seem
for digniti compos and high exploit
but all wa fals and hollow; though hi tongu
drop manna and could make the wors appear
the better reason to perplex and dash
maturest counsels: for hi thought were low--
to vice industri but to nobler deed
timor and sloth yet he pleas the ear
and with persuas accent thu began:--
i should be much for open war o peer
as not behind in hate if what wa urg
main reason to persuad immedi war
did not dissuad me most and seem to cast
omin conjectur on the whole success;
when he who most excel in fact of arm
in what he counsel and in what excel
mistrust ground hi courag on despair
and utter dissolut as the scope
of all hi aim after some dire reveng
first what revenge? the tower of heaven are fill
with arm watch that render all access
impregnable: oft on the boder deep
encamp their legion or with obscur wing
scout far and wide into the realm of night
scorn surpris or could we break our way
by forc and at our heel all hell should rise
with blackest insurrect to confound
heaven purest light yet our great enemi
all incorrupt would on hi throne
sit unpollut and th ether mould
incap of stain would soon expel
her mischief and purg off the baser fire
victori thu repuls our final hope
is flat despair: we must exasper
th almighti victor to spend all hi rage;
and that must end us; that must be our cure--
to be no more sad cure! for who would lose
though full of pain thi intellectu be
those thought that wander through etern
to perish rather swallow up and lost
in the wide womb of uncreat night
devoid of sens and motion? and who know
let thi be good whether our angri foe
can give it or will ever? how he can
is doubtful; that he never will is sure
will he so wise let loos at onc hi ire
belik through impot or unawar
to give hi enemi their wish and end
them in hi anger whom hi anger save
to punish endless? wherefor ceas we then?
say they who counsel war; we are decre
reserv and destin to etern woe;
whatev do what can we suffer more
what can we suffer worse? is thi then worst--
thu sit thu consult thu in arms?
what when we fled amain pursu and struck
with heaven afflict thunder and besought
the deep to shelter us? thi hell then seem
a refug from those wound or when we lay
chain on the burn lake? that sure wa wors
what if the breath that kindl those grim fire
awak should blow them into sevenfold rage
and plung us in the flames; or from abov
should intermit vengeanc arm again
hi red right hand to plagu us? what if all
her store were open and thi firmament
of hell should spout her cataract of fire
impend horror threaten hideou fall
one day upon our heads; while we perhap
design or exhort gloriou war
caught in a fieri tempest shall be hurl
each on hi rock transfix the sport and prey
or rack whirlwind or for ever sunk
under yon boil ocean wrapt in chain
there to convers with everlast groan
unrespit unpiti unrepriev
age of hopeless end? thi would be wors
war therefor open or conceal alik
my voic dissuades; for what can forc or guil
with him or who deceiv hi mind whose eye
view all thing at one view? he from heaven height
all these our motion vain see and derid
not more almighti to resist our might
than wise to frustrat all our plot and wile
shall we then live thu vile--th race of heaven
thu trampl thu expel to suffer here
chain and these torments? better these than wors
by my advice; sinc fate inevit
subdu us and omnipot decre
the victor will to suffer as to do
our strength is equal; nor the law unjust
that so ordain thi wa at first resolv
if we were wise against so great a foe
contend and so doubt what might fall
i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
and ventur if that fail them shrink and fear
what yet they know must follow--to endur
exil or igomini or bond or pain
the sentenc of their conqueror thi is now
our doom; which if we can sustain and bear
our suprem foe in time may much remit
hi anger and perhap thu far remov
not mind us not offend satisfi
with what is punished; whenc these rage fire
will slacken if hi breath stir not their flame
our purer essenc then will overcom
their noxiou vapour; or inur not feel;
or chang at length and to the place conform
in temper and in natur will receiv
familiar the fierc heat; and void of pain
thi horror will grow mild thi dark light;
besid what hope the never-end flight
of futur day may bring what chanc what chang
worth waiting--sinc our present lot appear
for happi though but ill for ill not worst
if we procur not to ourselv more woe
thu belial with word cloth in reason garb
counsel ignobl eas and peac sloth
not peace; and after him thu mammon spake:--
either to disenthron the king of heaven
we war if war be best or to regain
our own right lost him to unthron we then
may hope when everlast fate shall yield
to fickl chanc and chao judg the strife
the former vain to hope argu as vain
the latter; for what place can be for us
within heaven bound unless heaven lord suprem
we overpower? suppos he should relent
and publish grace to all on promis made
of new subjection; with what eye could we
stand in hi presenc humbl and receiv
strict law impos to celebr hi throne
with warbl hymn and to hi godhead sing
forc hallelujah while he lordli sit
our envi sovereign and hi altar breath
ambrosi odour and ambrosi flower
our servil offerings? thi must be our task
in heaven thi our delight how wearisom
etern so spent in worship paid
to whom we hate! let us not then pursu
by forc imposs by leav obtain
unaccept though in heaven our state
of splendid vassalage; but rather seek
our own good from ourselv and from our own
live to ourselv though in thi vast recess
free and to none account prefer
hard liberti befor the easi yoke
of servil pomp our great will appear
then most conspicu when great thing of small
use of hurt prosper of advers
we can creat and in what place soeer
thrive under evil and work eas out of pain
through labour and endur thi deep world
of dark do we dread? how oft amidst
thick cloud and dark doth heaven all-rul sire
choos to resid hi glori unobscur
and with the majesti of dark round
cover hi throne from whenc deep thunder roar
muster their rage and heaven resembl hell!
as he our dark cannot we hi light
imit when we please? thi desert soil
want not her hidden lustr gem and gold;
nor want we skill or art from whenc to rais
magnificence; and what can heaven show more?
our torment also may in length of time
becom our element these pierc fire
as soft as now sever our temper chang
into their temper; which must need remov
the sensibl of pain all thing invit
to peac counsel and the settl state
of order how in safeti best we may
compos our present evil with regard
of what we are and where dismiss quit
all thought of war ye have what i advis
he scarc had finish when such murmur fill
th assembl as when hollow rock retain
the sound of bluster wind which all night long
had rous the sea now with hoars cadenc lull
seafar men oerwatch whose bark by chanc
or pinnac anchor in a craggi bay
after the tempest such applaus wa heard
as mammon end and hi sentenc pleas
advis peace: for such anoth field
they dread wors than hell; so much the fear
of thunder and the sword of michael
wrought still within them; and no less desir
to found thi nether empir which might rise
by polici and long process of time
in emul opposit to heaven
which when beelzebub perceived--than whom
satan except none higher sat--with grave
aspect he rose and in hi rise seem
a pillar of state deep on hi front engraven
deliber sat and public care;
and princ counsel in hi face yet shone
majest though in ruin sage he stood
with atlantean shoulder fit to bear
the weight of mightiest monarchies; hi look
drew audienc and attent still as night
or summer noontid air while thu he spake:--
throne and imperi power offspr of heaven
ether virtues! or these titl now
must we renounc and chang style be call
princ of hell? for so the popular vote
inclines--her to continu and build up here
a grow empire; doubtless! while we dream
and know not that the king of heaven hath doom
thi place our dungeon not our safe retreat
beyond hi potent arm to live exempt
from heaven high jurisdict in new leagu
band against hi throne but to remain
in strictest bondag though thu far remov
under th inevit curb reserv
hi captiv multitud for he to be sure
in height or depth still first and last will reign
sole king and of hi kingdom lose no part
by our revolt but over hell extend
hi empir and with iron sceptr rule
us here as with hi golden those in heaven
what sit we then project peac and war?
war hath determin us and foil with loss
irreparable; term of peac yet none
vouchsaf or sought; for what peac will be given
to us enslav but custodi sever
and stripe and arbitrari punish
inflicted? and what peac can we return
but to our power hostil and hate
untam reluct and reveng though slow
yet ever plot how the conqueror least
may reap hi conquest and may least rejoic
in do what we most in suffer feel?
nor will occas want nor shall we need
with danger expedit to invad
heaven whose high wall fear no assault or sieg
or ambush from the deep what if we find
some easier enterprise? there is a place
(if ancient and prophet fame in heaven
err not)--anoth world the happi seat
of some new race call man about thi time
to be creat like to us though less
in power and excel but favour more
of him who rule above; so wa hi will
pronounc among the god and by an oath
that shook heaven whole circumfer confirm
thither let us bend all our thought to learn
what creatur there inhabit of what mould
or substanc how endu and what their power
and where their weakness: how attempt best
by forc of subtleti though heaven be shut
and heaven high arbitr sit secur
in hi own strength thi place may lie expos
the utmost border of hi kingdom left
to their defenc who hold it: here perhap
some advantag act may be achiev
by sudden onset--eith with hell-fir
to wast hi whole creation or possess
all as our own and drive as we were driven
the puni habitants; or if not drive
seduc them to our parti that their god
may prove their foe and with repent hand
abolish hi own work thi would surpass
common reveng and interrupt hi joy
in our confus and our joy uprais
in hi disturbance; when hi darl son
hurl headlong to partak with us shall curs
their frail origin and fade bliss--
fade so soon! advis if thi be worth
attempt or to sit in dark here
hatch vain empir thu beelzebub
plead hi devilish counsel--first devis
by satan and in part proposed: for whenc
but from the author of all ill could spring
so deep a malic to confound the race
of mankind in one root and earth with hell
to mingl and involv done all to spite
the great creator? but their spite still serv
hi glori to augment the bold design
pleas highli those infern state and joy
sparkl in all their eyes: with full assent
they vote: whereat hi speech he thu renews:--
well have ye judg well end long debat
synod of god and like to what ye are
great thing resolv which from the lowest deep
will onc more lift us up in spite of fate
nearer our ancient seat--perhap in view
of those bright confin whenc with neighbour arm
and opportun excurs we may chanc
re-ent heaven; or els in some mild zone
dwell not unvisit of heaven fair light
secur and at the brighten orient beam
purg off thi gloom: the soft delici air
to heal the scar of these corros fire
shall breath her balm but first whom shall we send
in search of thi new world? whom shall we find
sufficient? who shall tempt with wander feet
the dark unbottom infinit abyss
and through the palpabl obscur find out
hi uncouth way or spread hi airi flight
upborn with indefatig wing
over the vast abrupt ere he arriv
the happi isle? what strength what art can then
suffic or what evas bear him safe
through the strict senteri and station thick
of angel watch round? here he had need
all circumspection: and we now no less
choic in our suffrage; for on whom we send
the weight of all and our last hope reli
thi said he sat; and expect held
hi look suspens await who appear
to second or oppos or undertak
the peril attempt but all sat mute
ponder the danger with deep thoughts; and each
in other counten read hi own dismay
astonish none among the choic and prime
of those heaven-war champion could be found
so hardi as to proffer or accept
alon the dread voyage; till at last
satan whom now transcend glori rais
abov hi fellow with monarch pride
consciou of highest worth unmov thu spake:--
o progeni of heaven! empyr thrones!
with reason hath deep silenc and demur
seiz us though undismay long is the way
and hard that out of hell lead up to light
our prison strong thi huge convex of fire
outrag to devour immur us round
ninefold; and gate of burn adam
bar over us prohibit all egress
these pass if ani pass the void profound
of unessenti night receiv him next
wide-gap and with utter loss of be
threaten him plung in that abort gulf
if thenc he scape into whatev world
or unknown region what remain him less
than unknown danger and as hard escape?
but i should ill becom thi throne o peer
and thi imperi sovereignti adorn
with splendour arm with power if aught propos
and judg of public moment in the shape
of difficulti or danger could deter
me from attempt wherefor do i assum
these royalti and not refus to reign
refus to accept as great a share
of hazard as of honour due alik
to him who reign and so much to him due
of hazard more as he abov the rest
high honour sits? go therefor mighti power
terror of heaven though fallen; intend at home
while here shall be our home what best may eas
the present miseri and render hell
more tolerable; if there be cure or charm
to respit or deceiv or slack the pain
of thi ill mansion: intermit no watch
against a wake foe while i abroad
through all the coast of dark destruct seek
deliver for us all thi enterpris
none shall partak with me thu say rose
the monarch and prevent all reply;
prudent lest from hi resolut rais
other among the chief might offer now
certain to be refus what erst they fear
and so refus might in opinion stand
hi rival win cheap the high reput
which he through hazard huge must earn but they
dread not more th adventur than hi voic
forbidding; and at onc with him they rose
their rise all at onc wa as the sound
of thunder heard remot toward him they bend
with aw rever prone and as a god
extol him equal to the highest in heaven
nor fail they to express how much they prais
that for the gener safeti he despis
hi own: for neither do the spirit damn
lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast
their speciou deed on earth which glori excit
or close ambit varnish oer with zeal
thu they their doubt consult dark
end rejoic in their matchless chief:
as when from mountain-top the duski cloud
ascend while the north wind sleep oerspread

if chanc the radiant sun with farewel sweet

o shame to men! devil with devil damn
firm concord holds; men onli disagre

among themselv and levi cruel war
wast the earth each other to destroy:
as if (which might induc us to accord)
man had not hellish foe enow besid

the stygian council thu dissolved; and forth
in order came the grand infern peers:

and god-lik imit state: him round
a globe of fieri seraphim enclos
with bright emblazonri and horrent arm
then of their session end they bid cri
with trumpet regal sound the great result:
toward the four wind four speedi cherubim
put to their mouth the sound alchemi
by herald voic explained; the hollow abyss
heard far adn wide and all the host of hell
with deafen shout return them loud acclaim
thenc more at eas their mind and somewhat rais

part on the plain or in the air sublim
upon the wing or in swift race contend
as at th olympian game or pythian fields;
part curb their fieri steed or shun the goal
with rapid wheel or front brigad form:
as when to warn proud citi war appear

prick forth the airi knight and couch their spear
till thickest legion close; with feat of arm
from either end of heaven the welkin burn

rend up both rock and hill and ride the air

hi wrath which one day will destroy ye both!
she spake and at her word the hellish pest

through all the empyrean down they fell
driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down

into my hand wa given with charg to keep
these gate for ever shut which none can pass
without my open pensiv here i sat

hail holi light offspr of heaven firstborn
or of the etern coetern beam

and never but in unapproach light
dwelt from etern dwelt then in thee
bright effluenc of bright essenc increat
or hearst thou rather pure ether stream
whose fountain who shall tell? befor the sun
befor the heaven thou wert and at the voic
of god as with a mantl didst invest ***
the rise world of water dark and deep
won from the void and formless infinit
thee i re-visit now with bolder wing
escapd the stygian pool though long detaind
in that obscur sojourn while in my flight
through utter and through middl dark born
with other note than to the orphean lyre
i sung of chao and etern night;
taught by the heavenli muse to ventur down
the dark descent and up to re-ascend
though hard and rare: thee i revisit safe
and feel thi sovran vital lamp; but thou
revisitst not these eye that roll in vain
to find thi pierc ray and find no dawn;
so thick a drop seren hath quenchd their orb
or dim suffus veild yet not the more

clear spring or shadi grove or sunni hill
smit with the love of sacr song; but chief
thee sion and the floweri brook beneath
that wash thi hallowd feet and warbl flow

so were i equalld with them in renown
thi sovran command that man should find grace;
blind thamyri and blind maeonid
and tiresia and phineu prophet old:
then feed on thought that voluntari move
harmoni numbers; as the wake bird

tune her nocturn note thu with the year

day or the sweet approach of even or morn
or sight of vernal bloom or summer rose
or flock or herd or human face divine;
but cloud instead and ever-dur dark
surround me from the cheer way of men
cut off and for the book of knowledg fair
present with a univers blank

and wisdom at one entranc quit shut out
so much the rather thou celesti light

hi onli son; on earth he first beheld
our two first parent yet the onli two
of mankind in the happi garden placd

uninterrupt joy unrivalld love
in bliss solitude; he then surveyd
hell and the gulf between and satan there
coast the wall of heaven on thi side night
in the dun air sublim and readi now
to stoop with weari wing and will feet
on the bare outsid of thi world that seemd
firm land imbosomd without firmament
uncertain which in ocean or in air

wherein past present futur he behold
thu to hi onli son forese spake
onli begotten son seest thou what rage

second to thee offer himself to die
for man offenc o unexampl love
love no where to be found less than divine!
hail son of god saviour of men! thi name
shall be the copiou matter of my song
henceforth and never shall my heart thi prais
forget nor from thi father prais disjoin
thu they in heaven abov the starri sphere
their happi hour in joy and hymn spent
mean while upon the firm opac globe
of thi round world whose first convex divid
the lumin inferiour orb enclos
from chao and the inroad of dark old
satan alight walks: a globe far off
it seem now seem a boundless contin
dark wast and wild under the frown of night
starless expos and ever-threaten storm
of chao bluster round inclement sky;
save on that side which from the wall of heaven
though distant far some small reflect gain
of glimmer air less vex with tempest loud:
here walk the fiend at larg in spaciou field
as when a vultur on imau bred
whose snowi ridg the rove tartar bound
dislodg from a region scarc of prey
to gorg the flesh of lamb or yeanl kid
on hill where flock are fed fli toward the spring
of gang or hydasp indian streams;
but in hi way light on the barren plain
of sericana where chines drive
with sail and wind their cani waggon light:
so on thi windi sea of land the fiend
walk up and down alon bent on hi prey;
alon for other creatur in thi place
live or lifeless to be found wa none;
none yet but store hereaft from the earth
up hither like aereal vapour flew
of all thing transitori and vain when sin
with vaniti had fill the work of men:
both all thing vain and all who in vain thing
built their fond hope of glori or last fame
or happi in thi or the other life;
all who have their reward on earth the fruit
of pain superstit and blind zeal
nought seek but the prais of men here find
fit retribut empti as their deeds;
all the unaccomplish work of natur hand
abort monstrou or unkindli mix
dissolv on earth fleet hither and in vain
till final dissolut wander here;
not in the neighbour moon as some have dreamed;
those argent field more like habit
translat saint or middl spirit hold
betwixt the angel and human kind
hither of ill-join son and daughter born
first from the ancient world those giant came
with mani a vain exploit though then renowned:
the builder next of babel on the plain
of sennaar and still with vain design
new babel had they wherewith would build:
other came single; he who to be deem
a god leap fondli into aetna flame
empedocles; and he who to enjoy
plato elysium leap into the sea
cleombrotus; and mani more too long
embryo and idiot eremit and friar
white black and gray with all their trumperi
here pilgrim roam that stray so far to seek
in golgotha him dead who live in heaven;
and they who to be sure of paradis
die put on the weed of dominick
or in franciscan think to pass disguised;
they pass the planet seven and pass the fix
and that crystal sphere whose balanc weigh
the trepid talk and that first moved;
and now saint peter at heaven wicket seem
to wait them with hi key and now at foot
of heaven ascent they lift their feet when lo
a violent cross wind from either coast
blow them transvers ten thousand leagu awri
into the deviou air: then might ye see
cowl hood and habit with their wearer tost
and flutter into rags; then reliqu bead
indulg dispens pardon bull
the sport of winds: all these upwhirl aloft
fli oer the backsid of the world far off
into a limbo larg and broad sinc call
the paradis of fool to few unknown
long after; now unpeopl and untrod
all thi dark globe the fiend found as he pass
and long he wander till at last a gleam
of dawn light turn thither-ward in hast
hi travel steps: far distant he descri
ascend by degre magnific
up to the wall of heaven a structur high;
at top whereof but far more rich appear
the work as of a kingli palace-g
with frontispiec of diamond and gold
embellished; thick with sparkl orient gem
the portal shone inimit on earth
by model or by shade pencil drawn
these stair were such as whereon jacob saw
angel ascend and descend band
of guardian bright when he from esau fled
to padan-aram in the field of luz
dream by night under the open sky
and wake cri thi is the gate of heaven
each stair mysteri wa meant nor stood
there alway but drawn up to heaven sometim
viewless; and underneath a bright sea flow
of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
who after came from earth fail arriv
waft by angel or flew oer the lake
rapt in a chariot drawn by fieri steed
the stair were then let down whether to dare
the fiend by easi ascent or aggrav
hi sad exclus from the door of bliss:
direct against which open from beneath
just oer the bliss seat of paradis
a passag down to the earth a passag wide
wider by far than that of after-tim
over mount sion and though that were larg
over the promis land to god so dear;
by which to visit oft those happi tribe
on high behest hi angel to and fro
pass frequent and hi eye with choic regard
from panea the fount of jordan flood
to beersaba where the holi land
border on egypt and the arabian shore;
so wide the open seem where bound were set
to dark such as bound the ocean wave
satan from henc now on the lower stair
that scale by step of gold to heaven-g
look down with wonder at the sudden view
of all thi world at onc as when a scout
through dark?;nd desart way with?oeril gone
all?might?;t?kast by break of cheer dawn
obtain the brow of some high-climb hill
which to hi eye discov unawar
the goodli prospect of some foreign land
first seen or some renown metropoli
with glister spire and pinnacl adorn
which now the rise sun gild with hi beams:
such wonder seis though after heaven seen
the spirit malign but much more envi seis
at sight of all thi world beheld so fair
round he survey (and well might where he stood
so high abov the circl canopi
of night extend shade) from eastern point
of libra to the fleeci star that bear
andromeda far off atlantick sea
beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole
he view in breadth and without longer paus
down right into the world first region throw
hi flight precipit and wind with eas
through the pure marbl air hi obliqu way
amongst innumer star that shone
star distant but nigh hand seem other worlds;
or other world they seem or happi isl
like those hesperian garden fame of old
fortun field and grove and floweri vale
thrice happi isles; but who dwelt happi there
he staid not to inquire: abov them all
the golden sun in splendour likest heaven
allur hi eye; thither hi cours he bend
through the calm firmament (but up or down
by center or eccentrick hard to tell
or longitude) where the great luminari
aloof the vulgar constel thick
that from hi lordli eye keep distanc due
dispens light from far; they as they move
their starri danc in number that comput
day month and year toward hi all-cheer lamp
turn swift their variou motion or are turn
by hi magnetick beam that gentli warm

with gentl penetr though unseen

so wonder wa set hi station bright
there land the fiend a spot like which perhap
astronom in the sun lucent orb
through hi glaze optick tube yet never saw
the place he found beyond express bright
compar with aught on earth metal or stone;
not all part like but all alik inform
with radiant light as glow iron with fire;
if metal part seem gold part silver clear;
if stone carbuncl most or chrysolit
rubi or topaz to the twelv that shone
in aaron breast-plat and a stone besid
imagin rather oft than elsewher seen
that stone or like to that which here below
philosoph in vain so long have sought
in vain though by their power art they bind
volatil herm and call up unbound
in variou shape old proteu from the sea
drain through a limbeck to hi nativ form
what wonder then if field and region here
breath forth elixir pure and river run
potabl gold when with one virtuou touch
the arch-chemick sun so far from us remot
produc with terrestri humour mix
here in the dark so mani preciou thing
of colour gloriou and effect so rare?
here matter new to gaze the devil met
undazzled; far and wide hi eye commands;
for sight no obstacl found here nor shade
but all sun-shin as when hi beam at noon
culmin from the equat as they now
shot upward still direct whenc no way round
shadow from bodi opaqu can fall; and the air
no where so clear sharpen hi visual ray
to object distant far wherebi he soon
saw within ken a gloriou angel stand
the same whom john saw also in the sun:
hi back wa turn but not hi bright hid;
of beam sunni ray a golden tiar

illustri on hi shoulder fledg with wing

glad wa the spirit impur as now in hope
to find who might direct hi wander flight
to paradis the happi seat of man
hi journey end and our begin woe
but first he cast to chang hi proper shape
which els might work him danger or delay:
and now a stripl cherub he appear
not of the prime yet such as in hi face
youth smile celesti and to everi limb
suitabl grace diffus so well he feigned:
under a coronet hi flow hair
in curl on either cheek played; wing he wore
of mani a colour plume sprinkl with gold;
hi habit fit for speed succinct and held
befor hi decent step a silver wand
he drew not nigh unheard; the angel bright
ere he drew nigh hi radiant visag turn
admonish by hi ear and straight wa known
the arch-angel uriel one of the seven

that both in him and all thing as is meet

who justli hath driven out hi rebel foe

o for that warn voic which he who saw
the apocalyps heard cri in heaven aloud
then when the dragon put to second rout
came furiou down to be reveng on men
woe to the inhabit on earth! that now
while time wa our first parent had been warn
the come of their secret foe and scape
hapli so scape hi mortal snare: for now
satan now first inflam with rage came down
the tempter ere the accus of mankind
to wreak on innoc frail man hi loss
of that first battl and hi flight to hell:
yet not rejoic in hi speed though bold
far off and fearless nor with caus to boast
begin hi dire attempt; which nigh the birth
now roll boil in hi tumultu breast
and like a devilish engin back recoil
upon himself; horrour and doubt distract
hi troubl thought and from the bottom stir
the hell within him; for within him hell
he bring and round about him nor from hell
one step no more than from himself can fli
by chang of place: now conscienc wake despair
that slumbered; wake the bitter memori
of what he wa what is and what must be
worse; of wors deed wors suffer must ensu
sometim toward eden which now in hi view
lay pleasant hi griev look he fix sad;
sometim toward heaven and the full-blaz sun
which now sat high in hi meridian tower:
then much revolv thu in sigh began
o thou that with surpass glori crown
lookest from thi sole dominion like the god
of thi new world; at whose sight all the star
hide their diminish heads; to thee i call
but with no friendli voic and add thi name
of sun! to tell thee how i hate thi beam
that bring to my remembr from what state
i fell how gloriou onc abov thi sphere;
till pride and wors ambit threw me down
war in heaven against heaven matchless king:
ah wherefore! he deserv no such return
from me whom he creat what i wa
in that bright emin and with hi good
upbraid none; nor wa hi servic hard
what could be less than to afford him prais
the easiest recomp and pay him thank
how due! yet all hi good prove ill in me
and wrought but malice; lift up so high
i sdein subject and thought one step higher
would set me highest and in a moment quit
the debt immens of endless gratitud
so burdensom still pay still to owe
forget what from him i still receiv
and understood not that a grate mind
by owe owe not but still pay at onc
indebt and discharged; what burden then
o had hi power destini ordain
me some inferiour angel i had stood
then happy; no unbound hope had rais
ambition! yet whi not some other power
as great might have aspir and me though mean
drawn to hi part; but other power as great
fell not but stand unshaken from within
or from without to all temptat arm
hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accus
but heaven free love dealt equal to all?
be then hi love accurs sinc love or hate
to me alik it deal etern woe
nay curs be thou; sinc against hi thi will
chose freeli what it now so justli rue
me miserable! which way shall i fli
infinit wrath and infinit despair?
which way i fli is hell; myself am hell;
and in the lowest deep a lower deep
still threaten to devour me open wide
to which the hell i suffer seem a heaven
o then at last relent: is there no place
left for repent none for pardon left?
none left but by submission; and that word
disdain forbid me and my dread of shame
among the spirit beneath whom i seduc
with other promis and other vaunt
than to submit boast i could subdu
the omnipot ay me! they littl know
how dearli i abid that boast so vain
under what torment inwardli i groan
while they ador me on the throne of hell
with diadem and scepter high advanc
the lower still i fall onli suprem
in misery: such joy ambit find
but say i could repent and could obtain
by act of grace my former state; how soon
would highth recal high thought how soon unsay
what feign submiss swore? eas would recant
vow made in pain as violent and void
for never can true reconcil grow
where wound of deadli hate have pierc so deep:
which would but lead me to a wors relaps
and heavier fall: so should i purchas dear
short intermiss bought with doubl smart
thi know my punisher; therefor as far
from grant he as i from beg peace;
all hope exclud thu behold in stead
mankind creat and for him thi world
so farewel hope; and with hope farewel fear;
farewel remorse! all good to me is lost;
evil be thou my good; by thee at least
divid empir with heaven king i hold
by thee and more than half perhap will reign;
as man ere long and thi new world shall know
thu while he spake each passion dim hi face
thrice chang with pale ire envi and despair;
which mar hi borrow visag and betray
him counterfeit if ani eye beheld
for heavenli mind from such distemp foul
are ever clear whereof he soon awar
each perturb smooth with outward calm
artific of fraud; and wa the first
that practis falsehood under saintli show
deep malic to conceal couch with revenge:
yet not enough had practis to deceiv
uriel onc warned; whose eye pursu him down
the way he went and on the assyrian mount
saw him disfigur more than could befal
spirit of happi sort; hi gestur fierc
he mark and mad demeanour then alon
as he suppos all unobserv unseen
so on he fare and to the border come
of eden where delici paradis
now nearer crown with her enclosur green
as with a rural mound the champaign head
of a steep wilder whose hairi side
access denied; and overhead upgrew
insuper height of loftiest shade
cedar and pine and fir and branch palm
a sylvan scene and as the rank ascend
shade abov shade a woodi theatr
of stateliest view yet higher than their top
the verdur wall of paradis upsprung;

which to our gener sire gave prospect larg
into hi nether empir neighbour round
and higher than that wall a circl row
of goodliest tree loaden with fairest fruit
blossom and fruit at onc of golden hue
appear with gay enamel colour mixed:
on which the sun more glad impress hi beam
than in fair even cloud or humid bow
when god hath shower the earth; so love seem
that landskip: and of pure now purer air
meet hi approach and to the heart inspir
vernal delight and joy abl to drive

fan their odorifer wing dispens
nativ perfum and whisper whenc they stole
those balmi spoil as when to them who fail

well pleas they slack their cours and mani a leagu

so entertain those odor sweet the fiend
who came their bane; though with them better pleas
than asmodeu with the fishi fume
that drove him though enamour from the spous
of tobit son and with a vengeanc sent
from media post to egypt there fast bound
now to the ascent of that steep savag hill
satan had journey on pensiv and slow;
but further way found none so thick entwin
as one continu brake the undergrowth
of shrub and tangl bush had perplex
all path of man or beast that pass that way
one gate there onli wa and that look east
on the other side: which when the arch-felon saw
due entranc he disdained; and in contempt
at one flight bound high over-leap all bound
of hill or highest wall and sheer within
light on hi feet as when a prowl wolf
whom hunger drive to seek new haunt for prey
watch where shepherd pen their flock at eve
in hurdl cote amid the field secur
leap oer the fenc with eas into the fold:
or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
of some rich burgher whose substanti door
cross-bar and bolt fast fear no assault
in at the window climb or oer the tiles:
so clomb thi first grand thief into god fold;
so sinc into hi church lewd hirel climb
thenc up he flew and on the tree of life
the middl tree and highest there that grew

beneath him with new wonder now he view
to all delight of human sens expos
in narrow room natur whole wealth yea more

of god the garden wa by him in the east
of eden planted; eden stretch her line
from auran eastward to the royal tower
of great seleucia built by grecian king
of where the son of eden long befor
dwelt in telassar: in thi pleasant soil
hi far more pleasant garden god ordained;
out of the fertil ground he caus to grow
all tree of noblest kind for sight smell taste;
and all amid them stood the tree of life

our death the tree of knowledg grew fast by

southward through eden went a river larg
nor chang hi cours but through the shaggi hill
pass underneath ingulfed; for god had thrown
that mountain as hi garden-mould high rais
upon the rapid current which through vein
of porou earth with kindli thirst up-drawn
rose a fresh fountain and with mani a rill

down the steep glade and met the nether flood
which from hi darksom passag now appear

so pass they nake on nor shun the sight

thi one thi easi charg of all the tree
in paradis that bear delici fruit
so variou not to tast that onli tree
of knowledg plant by the tree of life;
so near grow death to life whateer death is
some dread thing no doubt; for well thou knowest
god hath pronounc it death to tast that tree
the onli sign of our obedi left
among so mani sign of power and rule
confer upon us and dominion given
over all other creatur that possess
earth air and sea then let us not think hard
one easi prohibit who enjoy
free leav so larg to all thing els and choic
unlimit of manifold delights:
but let us ever prais him and extol
hi bounti follow our delight task
to prune these grow plant and tend these flower
which were it toilsom yet with thee were sweet
to whom thu eve repli o thou for whom
and from whom i wa form flesh of thi flesh
and without whom am to no end my guid
and head! what thou hast said is just and right
for we to him inde all prais owe
and daili thanks; i chiefli who enjoy
so far the happier lot enjoy thee
pre-emin by so much odd while thou
like consort to thyself canst no where find
that day i oft rememb when from sleep
i first awak and found myself repos
under a shade on flower much wonder where
and what i wa whenc thither brought and how
not distant far from thenc a murmur sound
of water issu from a cave and spread
into a liquid plain then stood unmov
pure as the expans of heaven; i thither went
with unexperienc thought and laid me down
on the green bank to look into the clear
smooth lake that to me seem anoth sky
as i bent down to look just opposit
a shape within the wateri gleam appear
bend to look on me: i start back
it start back; but pleas i soon return
pleas it return as soon with answer look
of sympathi and love: there i had fix
mine eye till now and pine with vain desir
had not a voic thu warn me; what thou seest
what there thou seest fair creatur is thyself;
with thee it came and goes: but follow me
and i will bring thee where no shadow stay
thi come and thi soft embrac he
whose imag thou art; him thou shalt enjoy
insepar thine to him shalt bear
multitud like thyself and thenc be call
mother of human race what could i do
but follow straight invis thu led?
till i espi thee fair inde and tall
under a platane; yet methought less fair
less win soft less amiabl mild
than that smooth wateri image: back i turned;
thou follow cryedst aloud return fair eve;
whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest of him thou art
hi flesh hi bone; to give thee be i lent
out of my side to thee nearest my heart
substanti life to have thee by my side
henceforth an individu solac dear;
part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
my other half: with that thi gentl hand
seis mine: i yielded;and from that time see
how beauti is excel by manli grace
and wisdom which alon is truli fair
so spake our gener mother and with eye
of conjug attract unreprov
and meek surrend half-embrac lean
on our first father; half her swell breast
nake met hi under the flow gold
of her loos tress hid: he in delight
both of her beauti and submiss charm
smile with superiour love as jupit
on juno smile when he impregn the cloud
that shed mayflowers; and press her matron lip
with kiss pure: asid the devil turn
for envy; yet with jealou leer malign
eye them askanc and to himself thu plain
sight hate sight tormenting! thu these two
imparadis in one anoth arm
the happier eden shall enjoy their fill
of bliss on bliss; while i to hell am thrust
where neither joy nor love but fierc desir
among our other torment not the least
still unfulfil with pain of long pine
yet let me not forget what i have gain
from their own mouths: all is not their it seems;
one fatal tree there stand of knowledg call
forbidden them to taste: knowledg forbidden
suspici reasonless whi should their lord
envi them that? can it be sin to know?
can it be death? and do they onli stand
by ignorance? is that their happi state
the proof of their obedi and their faith?
o fair foundat laid whereon to build
their ruin! henc i will excit their mind
with more desir to know and to reject
enviou command invent with design
to keep them low whom knowledg might exalt
equal with gods: aspir to be such
they tast and die: what likeli can ensu
but first with narrow search i must walk round
thi garden and no corner leav unspied;
a chanc but chanc may lead where i may meet
some wander spirit of heaven by fountain side
or in thick shade retir from him to draw
what further would be learn live while ye may
yet happi pair; enjoy till i return
short pleasur for long woe are to succeed!
so say hi proud step he scorn turn
but with sli circumspect and began
through wood through wast oer hill oer dale hi roam
mean while in utmost longitud where heaven
with earth and ocean meet the set sun
slowli descend and with right aspect
against the eastern gate of paradis
level hi even rays: it wa a rock
of alabast pile up to the cloud
conspicu far wind with one ascent
access from earth one entranc high;
the rest wa craggi cliff that overhung
still as it rose imposs to climb
betwixt these rocki pillar gabriel sat
chief of the angelick guard await night;
about him exercis heroick game
the unarm youth of heaven but nigh at hand
celesti armouri shield helm and spear
hung high with diamond flame and with gold
thither came uriel glide through the even
on a sun-beam swift as a shoot star
in autumn thwart the night when vapour fire
impress the air and show the marin
from what point of hi compass to bewar
impetu winds: he thu began in hast
gabriel to thee thi cours by lot hath given
charg and strict watch that to thi happi place
no evil thing approach or enter in
thi day at highth of noon came to my sphere
a spirit zealou as he seem to know
more of the almighti work and chiefli man
god latest image: i describ hi way
bent all on speed and mark hi aeri gait;
but in the mount that lie from eden north
where he first light soon discern hi look
alien from heaven with passion foul obscured:
mine eye pursu him still but under shade
lost sight of him: one of the banish crew
i fear hath ventur from the deep to rais
new troubles; him thi care must be to find
to whom the wing warriour thu return
uriel no wonder if thi perfect sight
amid the sun bright circl where thou sitst
see far and wide: in at thi gate none pass
the vigil here place but such as come
well known from heaven; and sinc meridian hour
no creatur thence: if spirit of other sort
so mind have oer-leap these earthli bound
on purpos hard thou knowest it to exclud
spiritu substanc with corpor bar
but if within the circuit of these walk
in whatsoev shape he lurk of whom
thou tellest by morrow dawn i shall know
so promis he; and uriel to hi charg
return on that bright beam whose point now rais
bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
beneath the azores; whether the prime orb
incred how swift had thither roll
diurnal or thi less volubil earth
by shorter flight to the east had left him there
array with reflect purpl and gold
the cloud that on hi western throne attend
now came still even on and twilight gray
had in her sober liveri all thing clad;
silenc accompanied; for beast and bird
they to their grassi couch these to their nest
were slunk all but the wake nightingale;
she all night long her amor descant sung;
silenc wa pleased: now glow the firmament
with live sapphires: hesperu that led
the starri host rode brightest till the moon
rise in cloud majesti at length
appar queen unveil her peerless light
and oer the dark her silver mantl threw
when adam thu to eve fair consort the hour
of night and all thing now retir to rest
mind us of like repose; sinc god hath set
labour and rest as day and night to men
successive; and the time dew of sleep
now fall with soft slumbrou weight inclin
our eye-lids: other creatur all day long
rove idl unemploy and less need rest;
man hath hi daili work of bodi or mind
appoint which declar hi digniti
and the regard of heaven on all hi ways;
while other anim unact rang
and of their do god take no account
to-morrow ere fresh morn streak the east
with first approach of light we must be risen
and at our pleasant labour to reform
yon floweri arbour yonder alley green
our walk at noon with branch overgrown
that mock our scant manur and requir
more hand than our to lop their wanton growth:
those blossom also and those drop gum
that lie bestrown unsightli and unsmooth
ask riddanc if we mean to tread with ease;
mean while as natur will night bid us rest
to whom thu eve with perfect beauti adorn
my author and dispos what thou bidst
unargu i obey: so god ordains;
god is thi law thou mine: to know no more
is woman happiest knowledg and her prais
with thee convers i forget all time;
all season and their chang all pleas alik
sweet is the breath of morn her rise sweet
with charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun
when first on thi delight land he spread
hi orient beam on herb tree fruit and flower
glister with dew; fragrant the fertil earth
after soft showers; and sweet the come on
of grate even mild; then silent night
with thi her solemn bird and thi fair moon
and these the gem of heaven her starri train:
but neither breath of morn when she ascend
with charm of earliest birds; nor rise sun
on thi delight land; nor herb fruit flower
glister with dew; nor fragranc after showers;
nor grate even mild; nor silent night
with thi her solemn bird nor walk by moon
or glitter star-light without thee is sweet
but wherefor all night long shine these? for whom
thi gloriou sight when sleep hath shut all eyes?
to whom our gener ancestor repli
daughter of god and man accomplish eve
these have their cours to finish round the earth
by morrow even and from land to land
in order though to nation yet unborn
ministr light prepar they set and rise;
lest total dark should by night regain
her old possess and extinguish life
in natur and all things; which these soft fire
not onli enlighten but with kindli heat
of variou influenc foment and warm
temper or nourish or in part shed down
their stellar virtu on all kind that grow
on earth made herebi apter to receiv
perfect from the sun more potent ray
these then though unbeheld in deep of night
shine not in vain; nor think though men were none
that heaven would want spectat god want praise:
million of spiritu creatur walk the earth
unseen both when we wake and when we sleep:
all these with ceaseless prais hi work behold
both day and night: how often from the steep
of echo hill or thicket have we heard
celesti voic to the midnight air
sole or respons each to other note
sing their great creator? oft in band
while they keep watch or nightli round walk
with heavenli touch of instrument sound
in full harmonick number join their song
divid the night and lift our thought to heaven
thu talk hand in hand alon they pass
on to their bliss bower: it wa a place
chosen by the sovran planter when he frame
all thing to man delight use; the roof
of thickest covert wa inwoven shade
laurel and myrtl and what higher grew
of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
acanthu and each odor bushi shrub

iri all hue rose and jessamin
rear high their flourish head between and wrought
mosaick; underfoot the violet
crocu and hyacinth with rich inlay

such wa their awe of man in shadier bower

these lull by nightingal embrac slept

now had night measur with her shadowi cone
half way up hill thi vast sublunar vault

when gabriel to hi next in power thu spake
uzziel half these draw off and coast the south

such where ye find seis fast and hither bring
so say on he led hi radiant file

in search of whom they sought: him there they found
squat like a toad close at the ear of eve
assay by hi devilish art to reach

or if inspir venom he might taint

blown up with high conceit ingend pride
him thu intent ithuriel with hi spear
touch lightly; for no falshood can endur
touch of celesti temper but return
of forc to it own likeness: up he start
discov and surpris as when a spark

fit for the tun some magazin to store
against a rumour war the smutti grain
with sudden blaze diffus inflam the air;
so start up in hi own shape the fiend
back stept those two fair angel half amaz
so sudden to behold the grisli king;
yet thu unmov with fear accost him soon
which of those rebel spirit adjudg to hell
comest thou escap thi prison? and transform
whi satst thou like an enemi in wait
here watch at the head of these that sleep?
know ye not then said satan fill with scorn
know ye not me? ye knew me onc no mate
for you there sit where ye durst not soar:
not to know me argu yourselv unknown
the lowest of your throng; or if ye know
whi ask ye and superflu begin
your messag like to end as much in vain?
to whom thu zephon answer scorn with scorn
think not revolt spirit thi shape the same

as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure;
that glori then when thou no more wast good
depart from thee; and thou resemblest now
thi sin and place of doom obscur and foul
but come for thou be sure shalt give account
to him who sent us whose charg is to keep
thi place inviol and these from harm
so spake the cherub; and hi grave rebuk
sever in youth beauti ad grace
invincible: abash the devil stood
and felt how aw good is and saw
virtu in her shape how lovely; saw and pine
hi loss; but chiefli to find here observ
hi lustr visibl impaired; yet seem
undaunt if i must contend said he
best with the best the sender not the sent
or all at once; more glori will be won
or less be lost thi fear said zephon bold
will save us trial what the least can do
singl against thee wick and thenc weak
the fiend repli not overcom with rage;
but like a proud steed rein went haughti on
champ hi iron curb: to strive or fli
he held it vain; awe from abov had quell
hi heart not els dismay now drew they nigh
the western point where those half-round guard
just met and close stood in squadron join
a wait next command to whom their chief
gabriel from the front thu call aloud
o friends! i hear the tread of nimbl feet
hast thi way and now by glimps discern
ithuriel and zephon through the shade;
and with them come a third of regal port
but fade splendour wan; who by hi gait
and fierc demeanour seem the princ of hell
not like to part henc without contest;
stand firm for in hi look defianc lour
he scarc had end when those two approach
and brief relat whom they brought where found
how busi in what form and postur couch
to whom with stern regard thu gabriel spake
whi hast thou satan broke the bound prescrib
to thi transgress and disturb the charg
of other who approv not to transgress
by thi exampl but have power and right
to question thi bold entranc on thi place;
employ it seem to violat sleep and those
whose dwell god hath plant here in bliss!
to whom thu satan with contemptu brow
gabriel? thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise
and such i held thee; but thi question ask
put me in doubt live there who love hi pain!
who would not find way break loos from hell
though thither doomed! thou wouldst thyself no doubt
and boldli ventur to whatev place
farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to chang
torment with eas and soonest recompens
dole with delight which in thi place i sought;
to thee no reason who knowest onli good
but evil hast not tried: and wilt object
hi will who bound us! let him surer bar
hi iron gate if he intend our stay
in that dark durance: thu much what wa ask
the rest is true they found me where they say;
but that impli not violenc or harm
thu he in scorn the warlik angel move
disdain half smile thu repli
o loss of one in heaven to judg of wise
sinc satan fell whom folli overthrew
and now return him from hi prison scape
grave in doubt whether to hold them wise
or not who ask what bold brought him hither
unlicens from hi bound in hell prescribed;
so wise he judg it to fli from pain
howev and to scape hi punishment!
so judg thou still presumptuous! till the wrath
which thou incurrest by fli meet thi flight
sevenfold and scourg that wisdom back to hell
which taught thee yet no better that no pain
can equal anger infinit provok
but wherefor thou alone? wherefor with thee
came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
less hardi to endure? courag chief!
the first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleg

thou sure hadst not come sole fugit
to which the fiend thu answer frown stern
not that i less endur or shrink from pain

and second thi els not dread spear
but still thi word at random as befor
argu thi inexperi what behov
from hard assay and ill success past
a faith leader not to hazard all
through way of danger by himself untried:
i therefor i alon first undertook
to wing the desol abyss and spi
thi new creat world whereof in hell
fame is not silent here in hope to find
better abod and my afflict power
to settl here on earth or in mid air;
though for possess put to tri onc more

whose easier busi were to serv their lord
high up in heaven with song to hymn hi throne
and practis distanc to cring not fight
to whom the warriour angel soon repli
to say and straight unsay pretend first
wise to fli pain profess next the spi
argu no leader but a liear trace
satan and couldst thou faith add? o name
o sacr name of faith profaned!
faith to whom? to thi rebelli crew?
armi of fiend fit bodi to fit head
wa thi your disciplin and faith engag

and thou sli hypocrit who now wouldst seem
patron of liberti who more than thou

to dispossess him and thyself to reign?
but mark what i arre thee now avant;

book v


now morn her rosi step in the eastern clime
advanc sow the earth with orient pearl
when adam wake so customed; for hi sleep
wa aery-light from pure digest bred
and temper vapour bland which the onli sound
of leav and fume rill aurora fan
lightli dispers and the shrill matin song
of bird on everi bough; so much the more
hi wonder wa to find unwaken eve
with tress discompos and glow cheek
as through unquiet rest: he on hi side
lean half rais with look of cordial love
hung over her enamour and beheld
beauti which whether wake or asleep
shot forth peculiar graces; then with voic
mild as when zephyru on flora breath
her hand soft touch whisper thu awak
my fairest my espous my latest found
heaven last best gift my ever new delight!
awake: the morn shine and the fresh field
call us; we lose the prime to mark how spring
our tender plant how blow the citron grove
what drop the myrrh and what the balmi reed
how natur paint her colour how the bee
sit on the bloom extract liquid sweet
such whisper wake her but with startl eye
on adam whom embrac thu she spake
o sole in whom my thought find all repos
my glori my perfection! glad i see
thi face and morn returned; for i thi night
(such night till thi i never passed) have dream
if dream not as i oft am wont of thee
work of day past or morrow next design
but of offenc and troubl which my mind
knew never till thi irksom night: methought
close at mine ear one call me forth to walk
with gentl voice; i thought it thine: it said
whi sleepest thou eve? now is the pleasant time
the cool the silent save where silenc yield
to the night-warbl bird that now awak
tune sweetest hi love-labour song; now reign
full-orb the moon and with more pleas light
shadowi set off the face of things; in vain
if none regard; heaven wake with all hi eye
whom to behold but thee natur desire?
in whose sight all thing joy with ravish
attract by thi beauti still to gaze
i rose as at thi call but found thee not;
to find thee i direct then my walk;
and on methought alon i pass through way
that brought me on a sudden to the tree
of interdict knowledge: fair it seem
much fairer to my fanci than by day:
and as i wonder look besid it stood
one shape and wing like one of those from heaven
by us oft seen; hi dewi lock distil
ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;
and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharg
deign none to eas thi load and tast thi sweet
nor god nor man? is knowledg so despised?
or envi or what reserv forbid to taste?
forbid who will none shall from me withhold
longer thi offer good; whi els set here?
thi said he paus not but with ventur arm
he pluck he tasted; me damp horrour chill
at such bold word vouch with a deed so bold:
but he thu overjoyed; o fruit divin
sweet of thyself but much more sweet thu cropt
forbidden here it seem as onli fit
for god yet abl to make god of men:
and whi not god of men; sinc good the more
commun more abund grow
the author not impair but honour more?
here happi creatur fair angelick eve!
partak thou also; happi though thou art
happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be:
tast thi and be henceforth among the god
thyself a goddess not to earth confin
but sometim in the air as we sometim
ascend to heaven by merit thine and see
what life the god live there and such live thou!
so say he drew nigh and to me held
even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
which he had plucked; the pleasant savouri smell
so quicken appetit that i methought
could not but tast forthwith up to the cloud
with him i flew and underneath beheld
the earth outstretch immens a prospect wide
and various: wonder at my flight and chang
to thi high exaltation; suddenli
my guid wa gone and i methought sunk down
and fell asleep; but o how glad i wake
to find thi but a dream! thu eve her night
relat and thu adam answer sad
best imag of myself and dearer half
the troubl of thi thought thi night in sleep
affect me equally; nor can i like
thi uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear;
yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none
creat pure but know that in the soul
are mani lesser faculti that serv
reason as chief; among these fanci next
her offic holds; of all extern thing
which the five watch sens repres
she form imagin aeri shape
which reason join or disjoin frame
all what we affirm or what deni and call
our knowledg or opinion; then retir
into her privat cell when natur rest
oft in her absenc mimick fanci wake
to imit her; but misjoin shape
wild work produc oft and most in dreams;
ill match word and deed long past or late
some such resembl methink i find
of our last even talk in thi thi dream
but with addit strange; yet be not sad
evil into the mind of god or man
may come and go so unreprov and leav
no spot or blame behind: which give me hope
that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
wake thou never will consent to do
be not dishearten then nor cloud those look
that wont to be more cheer and seren
than when fair morn first smile on the world;
and let us to our fresh employ rise
among the grove the fountain and the flower
that open now their choisest bosom smell
reserv from night and kept for thee in store
so cheer he hi fair spous and she wa cheered;
but silent a gentl tear let fall
from either eye and wipe them with her hair;
two other preciou drop that readi stood
each in their crystal sluic he ere they fell
kiss as the graciou sign of sweet remors
and piou awe that fear to have offend
so all wa clear and to the field they hast
but first from under shadi arbor roof
soon as they forth were come to open sight
of day-spr and the sun who scarc up-risen
with wheel yet hover oer the ocean-brim
shot parallel to the earth hi dewi ray
discov in wide landskip all the east
of paradis and eden happi plain
lowli they bow ador and began
their orison each morn duli paid
in variou style; for neither variou style
nor holi raptur want they to prais
their maker in fit strain pronounc or sung

to whom the patriarch of mankind repli
o favour spirit propiti guest
well hast thou taught the way that might direct

in contempl of creat thing

what meant that caution join if ye be found
obedient? can we want obedi then
to him or possibl hi love desert
who form us from the dust and place us here
full to the utmost measur of what bliss
human desir can seek or apprehend?
to whom the angel son of heaven and earth
attend! that thou art happi owe to god;
that thou continuest such owe to thyself
that is to thi obedience; therein stand
thi wa that caution given thee; be advis
god made thee perfect not immutable;
and good he made thee but to persever
he left it in thi power; ordain thi will
by natur free not over-rul by fate
inextric or strict necessity:
our voluntari servic he requir
not our necessitated; such with him
find no accept nor can find; for how
can heart not free be tri whether they serv
will or no who will but what they must
by destini and can no other choose?
myself and all the angelick host that stand
in sight of god enthron our happi state
hold as you your while our obedi holds;
on other sureti none: freeli we serv
becaus we freeli love as in our will
to love or not; in thi we stand or fall:
and some are fallen to disobedi fallen
and so from heaven to deepest hell; o fall
from what high state of bliss into what woe!
to whom our great progenitor thi word
attent and with more delight ear
divin instruct i have heard than when
cherubick song by night from neighbour hill
aereal musick send: nor knew i not
to be both will and deed creat free;
yet that we never shall forget to love
our maker and obey him whose command
singl is yet so just my constant thought
assur me and still assure: though what thou tellest
hath pass in heaven some doubt within me move
but more desir to hear if thou consent
the full relat which must need be strang
worthi of sacr silenc to be heard;
and we have yet larg day for scarc the sun
hath finish half hi journey and scarc begin
hi other half in the great zone of heaven
thu adam made request; and raphael
after short paus assent thu began
high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men
sad task and hard: for how shall i relat
to human sens the invis exploit
of war spirits? how without remors
the ruin of so mani gloriou onc
and perfect while they stood? how last unfold
the secret of anoth world perhap
not law to reveal? yet for thi good
thi is dispensed; and what surmount the reach
of human sens i shall delin so
by liken spiritu to corpor form
as may express them best; though what if earth
be but a shadow of heaven and thing therein
each to other like more than on earth is thought?
as yet thi world wa not and chao wild
reign where these heaven now roll where earth now rest
upon her center poised; when on a day
(for time though in etern appli
to motion measur all thing durabl
by present past and future) on such day
as heaven great year bring forth the empyr host
of angel by imperi summon call
innumer befor the almighti throne
forthwith from all the end of heaven appear
under their hierarch in order bright:
ten thousand thousand ensign high advanc
standard and gonfalon twixt van and rear
stream in the air and for distinct serv
of hierarchi of order and degrees;
or in their glitter tissu bear imblaz
holi memori act of zeal and love
record emin thu when in orb

thi day i have begot whom i declar
my onli son and on thi holi hill

and by myself have sworn to him shall bow
all knee in heaven and shall confess him lord:
under hi great vice-ger reign abid
unit as one individu soul
for ever happy: him who disobey
me disobey break union and that day
cast out from god and bless vision fall
into utter dark deep ingulf hi place
ordain without redempt without end
so spake the omnipot and with hi word
all seem well pleased; all seem but were not all
that day as other solemn day they spent
in song and danc about the sacr hill;
mystic danc which yonder starri sphere
of planet and of fix in all her wheel

eccentrick intervolv yet regular
then most when most irregular they seem;
and in their motion harmoni divin
so smooth her charm tone that god own ear

forthwith from danc to sweet repast they turn
desirous; all in circl as they stood

excess befor the all-bount king who shower
with copiou hand rejoic in their joy
now when ambrosi night with cloud exhal
from that high mount of god whenc light and shade
spring both the face of brightest heaven had chang

in darker veil) and roseat dew dispos
all but the unsleep eye of god to rest;
wide over all the plain and wider far

(such are the court of god) the angelick throng
dispers in band and file their camp extend

pavilion numberless and sudden rear
celesti tabernacl where they slept

melodi hymn about the sovran throne
altern all night long: but not so wake
satan; so call him now hi former name

if not the first arch-angel great in power
in favour and pre-emin yet fraught
with envi against the son of god that day

new law from him who reign new mind may rais

to utter is not safe assembl thou
of all those myriad which we lead the chief;
tell them that by command ere yet dim night

and all who under me their banner wave
homeward with fli march where we possess
the quarter of the north; there to prepar
fit entertain to receiv our king
the great messiah and hi new command
who speedili through all the hierarchi

so spake the fals arch-angel and infus
bad influenc into the unwari breast

that the most high command now ere night
now ere dim night had disincumb heaven
the great hierarch standard wa to move;
tell the suggest caus and cast between
ambigu word and jealousi to sound

the wont signal and superiour voic
of their great potentate; for great inde

nearli it now concern us to be sure

nor so content hath in hi thought to tri

laughest at their vain design and tumult vain
matter to me of glori whom their hate

so spake the son; but satan with hi power
far wa advanc on wing speed; an host
innumer as the star of night
or star of morn dew-drop which the sun
impearl on everi leaf and everi flower
region they pass the mighti regenc
of seraphim and potent and throne
in their tripl degrees; region to which
all thi dominion adam is no more
than what thi garden is to all the earth
and all the sea from one entir globos
stretch into longitude; which have pass
at length into the limit of the north
they came; and satan to hi royal seat
high on a hill far blaze as a mount
rais on a mount with pyramid and tower
from diamond quarri hewn and rock of gold;
the palac of great lucif (so call
that structur in the dialect of men
interpreted) which not long after he
affect all equal with god
in imit of that mount whereon
messiah wa declar in sight of heaven
the mountain of the congreg called;
for thither he assembl all hi train
pretend so command to consult
about the great recept of their king
thither to come and with calumni art
of counterfeit truth thu held their ear
throne domin princedom virtu powers;
if these magnifick titl yet remain
not mere titular sinc by decre
anoth now hath to himself engross
all power and us eclips under the name
of king anoint for whom all thi hast
of midnight-march and hurri meet here
thi onli to consult how we may best
with what may be devis of honour new
receiv him come to receiv from us
knee-tribut yet unpaid prostrat vile!
too much to one! but doubl how endur
to one and to hi imag now proclaimed?
but what if better counsel might erect
our mind and teach us to cast off thi yoke?
will ye submit your neck and choos to bend
the suppl knee? ye will not if i trust
to know ye right or if ye know yourselv
nativ and son of heaven possess befor
by none; and if not equal all yet free
equal free; for order and degre
jar not with liberti but well consist
who can in reason then or right assum
monarchi over such as live by right
hi equal if in power and splendour less
in freedom equal? or can introduc
law and edict on us who without law
err not? much less for thi to be our lord
and look for ador to the abus
of those imperi titl which assert
our be ordain to govern not to serv
thu far hi bold discours without controul
had audience; when among the seraphim
abdiel than whom none with more zeal ador
the deiti and divin command obey
stood up and in a flame of zeal sever
the current of hi furi thu oppos
o argument blasphem fals and proud!
word which no ear ever to hear in heaven
expect least of all from thee ingrat
in place thyself so high abov thi peer
canst thou with impiou obloquy condemn
the just decre of god pronounc and sworn
that to hi onli son by right endu
with regal scepter everi soul in heaven
shall bend the knee and in that honour due
confess him right king? unjust thou sayest
flatli unjust to bind with law the free
and equal over equal to let reign
one over all with unsucceed power
shalt thou give law to god? shalt thou disput
with him the point of liberti who made
thee what thou art and form the power of heaven
such as he pleas and circumscrib their being?
yet by experi taught we know how good
and of our good and of our digniti
how provid he is; how far from thought
to make us less bent rather to exalt
our happi state under one head more near
unit but to grant it thee unjust
that equal over equal monarch reign:
thyself though great and gloriou dost thou count
or all angelick natur join in one
equal to him begotten son? by whom
as by hi word the mighti father made
all thing even thee; and all the spirit of heaven
by him creat in their bright degre
crown them with glori and to their glori name

essenti powers; nor by hi reign obscur
but more illustri made; sinc he the head

hi law our laws; all honour to him done
return our own ceas then thi impiou rage
and tempt not these; but hasten to appeas
the incens father and the incens son
while pardon may be found in time besought
so spake the fervent angel; but hi zeal
none second as out of season judg
or singular and rash: whereat rejoic
the apost and more haughti thu repli
that we were form then sayest thou? and the work
of secondari hand by task transfer
from father to hi son? strang point and new!
doctrin which we would know whenc learned: who saw
when thi creation was? rememberest thou
thi make while the maker gave thee being?
we know no time when we were not as now;
know none befor us self-begot self-rais
by our own quicken power when fatal cours
had circl hi full orb the birth matur
of thi our nativ heaven ether son
our puissanc is our own; our own right hand
shall teach us highest deed by proof to tri
who is our equal: then thou shalt behold
whether by supplic we intend
address and to begirt the almighti throne
beseech or besieg thi report
these tide carri to the anoint king;
and fli ere evil intercept thi flight
he said; and as the sound of water deep
hoars murmur echo to hi word applaus
through the infinit host; nor less for that
the flame seraph fearless though alon
encompass round with foe thu answer bold
o alien from god o spirit accurs
forsaken of all good! i see thi fall
determin and thi hapless crew involv
in thi perfidi fraud contagion spread
both of thi crime and punishment: henceforth
no more be troubl how to quit the yoke
of god messiah; those indulg law
will not be now vouchsafed; other decre
against thee are gone forth without recall;
that golden scepter which thou didst reject
is now an iron rod to bruis and break
thi disobedi well thou didst advise;
yet not for thi advic or threat i fli
these wick tent devot lest the wrath
impend rage into sudden flame
distinguish not: for soon expect to feel
hi thunder on thi head devour fire
then who creat thee lament learn
when who can uncreat thee thou shalt know
so spake the seraph abdiel faith found
among the faithless faith onli he;
among innumer fals unmov
unshaken unseduc unterrifi
hi loyalti he kept hi love hi zeal;
nor number nor exampl with him wrought
to swerv from truth or chang hi constant mind
though singl from amidst them forth he pass
long way through hostil scorn which he sustain

and with retort scorn hi back he turn

where light and dark in perpetu round
lodg and dislodg by turn which make through heaven
grate vicissitud like day and night;
light issu forth and at the other door
obsequi dark enter till her hour
to veil the heaven though dark there might well
seem twilight here: and now went forth the morn
such as in highest heaven array in gold
empyreal; from befor her vanish night
shot through with orient beams; when all the plain
cover with thick embattl squadron bright
chariot and flame arm and fieri steed
reflect blaze on blaze first met hi view:
war he perceiv war in procinct; and found
alreadi known what he for news had thought
to have reported: gladli then he mix
among those friendli power who him receiv
with joy and acclam loud that one
that of so mani myriad fallen yet one
return not lost on to the sacr hill
they led him high applaud and present
befor the seat supreme; from whenc a voic
from midst a golden cloud thu mild wa heard
servant of god well done; well hast thou fought
the better fight who singl hast maintain
against revolt multitud the caus
of truth in word mightier than they in arms;
and for the testimoni of truth hast born
univers reproach far wors to bear
than violence; for thi wa all thi care
to stand approv in sight of god though world
judg thee perverse: the easier conquest now
remain thee aid by thi host of friend
back on thi foe more gloriou to return
than scorn thou didst depart; and to subdu
by forc who reason for their law refus
right reason for their law and for their king
messiah who by right of merit reign
go michael of celesti armi princ
and thou in militari prowess next
gabriel lead forth to battl these my son
invincible; lead forth my arm saint
by thousand and by million rang for fight
equal in number to that godless crew
rebellious: them with fire and hostil arm
fearless assault; and to the brow of heaven
pursu drive them out from god and bliss
into their place of punish the gulf
of tartaru which readi open wide
hi fieri chao to receiv their fall
so spake the sovran voic and cloud began
to darken all the hill and smoke to roll
in duski wreath reluct flame the sign
of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud
ether trumpet from on high gan blow:
at which command the power milit
that stood for heaven in mighti quadrat join
of union irresist move on
in silenc their bright legion to the sound
of instrument harmoni that breath
heroick ardour to adventur deed
under their god-lik leader in the caus
of god and hi messiah on they move
indissolubl firm; nor obviou hill
nor straiten vale nor wood nor stream divid
their perfect ranks; for high abov the ground
their march wa and the passiv air upbor
their nimbl tread; as when the total kind
of bird in orderli array on wing
came summon over eden to receiv
their name of thee; so over mani a tract
of heaven they march and mani a provinc wide
tenfold the length of thi terrene: at last
far in the horizon to the north appear
from skirt to skirt a fieri region stretch
in battail aspect and nearer view
bristl with upright beam innumer
of rigid spear and helmet throng and shield
variou with boast argument portray
the band power of satan hast on
with furiou expedition; for they ween
that self-sam day by fight or by surpris
to win the mount of god and on hi throne
to set the envier of hi state the proud
aspirer; but their thought prove fond and vain
in the mid way: though strang to us it seem
at first that angel should with angel war
and in fierc host meet who wont to meet
so oft in festiv of joy and love
unanim as son of one great sire
hymn the etern father: but the shout
of battl now began and rush sound
of onset end soon each milder thought
high in the midst exalt as a god
the apost in hi sun-bright chariot sat
idol of majesti divin enclos
with flame cherubim and golden shields;
then light from hi gorgeou throne for now
twixt host and host but narrow space wa left
a dread interv and front to front
present stood in terribl array
of hideou length: befor the cloudi van
on the rough edg of battl ere it join
satan with vast and haughti stride advanc
came tower arm in adam and gold;
abdiel that sight endur not where he stood
among the mightiest bent on highest deed
and thu hi own undaunt heart explor
o heaven! that such resembl of the highest
should yet remain where faith and realti
remain not: wherefor should not strength and might
there fail where virtu fail or weakest prove
where boldest though to fight unconquerable?
hi puissanc trust in the almighti aid
i mean to tri whose reason i have tri
unsound and false; nor is it aught but just
that he who in debat of truth hath won
should win in arm in both disput alik
victor; though brutish that contest and foul
when reason hath to deal with forc yet so
most reason is that reason overcom
so ponder and from hi arm peer
forth step opposit half-way he met
hi dare foe at thi prevent more
incens and thu secur him defi
proud art thou met? thi hope wa to have reach
the highth of thi aspir unoppos
the throne of god unguard and hi side
abandon at the terrour of thi power
or potent tongue: fool!not to think how vain
against the omnipot to rise in arms;
who out of smallest thing could without end
have rais incess armi to defeat
thi folly; or with solitari hand
reach beyond all limit at one blow
unaid could have finish thee and whelm
thi legion under darkness: but thou seest
all are not of thi train; there be who faith
prefer and pieti to god though then
to thee not visibl when i alon
seem in thi world erron to dissent
from all: my sect thou seest;now learn too late
how few sometim may know when thousand err
whom the grand foe with scorn eye askanc
thu answer ill for thee but in wish hour
of my reveng first sought for thou returnest
from flight sediti angel! to receiv
thi merit reward the first assay
of thi right hand provok sinc first that tongu
inspir with contradict durst oppos
a third part of the god in synod met
their deiti to assert; who while they feel
vigour divin within them can allow
omnipot to none but well thou comest
befor thi fellow ambiti to win
from me some plume that thi success may show
destruct to the rest: thi paus between
(unansw lest thou boast) to let thee know
at first i thought that liberti and heaven
to heavenli soul had been all one; but now
i see that most through sloth had rather serv
ministr spirit train up in feast and song!
such hast thou arm the minstrelsi of heaven
servil with freedom to contend
as both their deed compar thi day shall prove
to whom in brief thu abdiel stern repli
apostate! still thou errest nor end wilt find
of er from the path of truth remote:
unjustli thou depravest it with the name
of servitud to serv whom god ordain
or nature: god and natur bid the same
when he who rule is worthiest and excel
them whom he govern thi is servitud
to serv the unwis or him who hath rebel
against hi worthier as thine now serv thee
thyself not free but to thyself enthralled;
yet lewdli darest our ministr upbraid
reign thou in hell thi kingdom; let me serv
in heaven god ever blest and hi divin
behest obey worthiest to be obeyed;
yet chain in hell not realm expect: mean while
from me return as erst thou saidst from flight
thi greet on thi impiou crest receiv
so say a nobl stroke he lift high
which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
on the proud crest of satan that no sight
nor motion of swift thought less could hi shield
such ruin intercept: ten pace huge
he back recoiled; the tenth on bend knee
hi massi spear upstaid; as if on earth
wind under ground or water forc way
sidelong had push a mountain from hi seat
half sunk with all hi pine amaz seis
the rebel throne but greater rage to see
thu foil their mightiest; our joy fill and shout
presag of victori and fierc desir
of battle: whereat michael bid sound
the arch-angel trumpet; through the vast of heaven
it sound and the faith armi rung
hosanna to the highest: nor stood at gaze
the advers legion nor less hideou join
the horrid shock now storm furi rose
and clamour such as heard in heaven till now
wa never; arm on armour clash bray
horribl discord and the mad wheel
of brazen chariot raged; dire wa the nois
of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
of fieri dart in flame volli flew
and fli vault either host with fire
so under fieri cope togeth rush
both battl main with ruinou assault
and inextinguish rage all heaven
resounded; and had earth been then all earth
had to her center shook what wonder? when
million of fierc encount angel fought
on either side the least of whom could wield
these element and arm him with the forc
of all their regions: how much more of power
armi against armi numberless to rais
dread combust war and disturb
though not destroy their happi nativ seat;
had not the etern king omnipot
from hi strong hold of heaven high over-rul
and limit their might; though number such
as each divid legion might have seem
a numer host; in strength each arm hand
a legion; led in fight yet leader seem
each warriour singl as in chief expert
when to advanc or stand or turn the sway
of battl open when and when to close
the ridg of grim war: no thought of flight
none of retreat no unbecom deed
that argu fear; each on himself reli
as onli in hi arm the moment lay
of victory: deed of etern fame
were done but infinite; for wide wa spread
that war and various; sometim on firm ground
a stand fight then soar on main wing
torment all the air; all air seem then
conflict fire long time in even scale
the battl hung; till satan who that day
prodigi power had shown and met in arm
no equal rang through the dire attack
of fight seraphim confus at length
saw where the sword of michael smote and fell
squadron at once; with huge two-hand sway
brandish aloft the horrid edg came down
wide-wasting; such destruct to withstand

and visag all inflam first thu began
author of evil unknown till thi revolt
unnam in heaven now plenteou as thou seest
these act of hate strife hate to all
though heaviest by just measur on thyself
and thi adherents: how hast thou disturb
heaven bless peac and into natur brought
miseri uncreat till the crime
of thi rebellion! how hast thou instil
thi malic into thousand onc upright
and faith now prove false! but think not here
to troubl holi rest; heaven cast thee out
from all her confin heaven the seat of bliss
brook not the work of violenc and war
henc then and evil go with thee along
thi offspr to the place of evil hell;
thou and thi wick crew! there mingl broil
ere thi aveng sword begin thi doom
or some more sudden vengeanc wing from god
precipit thee with augment pain
so spake the princ of angels; to whom thu
the adversari nor think thou with wind
of aeri threat to awe whom yet with deed
thou canst not hast thou turn the least of these
to flight or if to fall but that they rise
unvanquish easier to transact with me
that thou shouldst hope imperi and with threat
to chase me hence? err not that so shall end
the strife which thou callest evil but we style
the strife of glory; which we mean to win
or turn thi heaven itself into the hell
thou fablest; here howev to dwell free
if not to reign: mean while thi utmost forc
and join him name almighti to thi aid
i fli not but have sought thee far and nigh
they end parl and both address for fight
unspeakable; for who though with the tongu
of angel can relat or to what thing
liken on earth conspicu that may lift
human imagin to such highth
of godlik power? for likest god they seem
stood they or move in statur motion arm
fit to decid the empir of great heaven
now wave their fieri sword and in the air
made horrid circles; two broad sun their shield
blaze opposit while expect stood
in horrour: from each hand with speed retir
where erst wa thickest fight the angelick throng
and left larg field unsaf within the wind
of such commotion; such as to set forth
great thing by small if natur concord broke
among the constel war were sprung
two planet rush from aspect malign
of fiercest opposit in mid sky
should combat and their jar sphere confound
togeth both with next to almighti arm
up-lift immin one stroke they aim
that might determin and not need repeat
as not of power at once; nor odd appear
in might or swift prevention: but the sword
of michael from the armouri of god
wa given him temper so that neither keen
nor solid might resist that edge: it met
the sword of satan with steep forc to smite
descend and in half cut sheer; nor staid
but with swift wheel revers deep enter share
all hi right side: then satan first knew pain
and writh him to and fro convolved; so sore
the gride sword with discontinu wound
pass through him: but the ether substanc close
not long divisible; and from the gash
a stream of nectur humour issu flow
sanguin such as celesti spirit may bleed
and all hi armour stain ere while so bright
forthwith on all side to hi aid wa run
by angel mani and strong who interpos
defenc while other bore him on their shield
back to hi chariot where it stood retir
from off the file of war: there they him laid
gnash for anguish and despit and shame
to find himself not matchless and hi pride
humbl by such rebuk so far beneath
hi confid to equal god in power
yet soon he healed; for spirit that live throughout
vital in everi part not as frail man
in entrail heart of head liver or rein
cannot but by annihil die;
nor in their liquid textur mortal wound
receiv no more than can the fluid air:
all heart they live all head all eye all ear
all intellect all sense; and as they pleas
they limb themselv and colour shape or size

mean while in other part like deed deserv

and with fierc ensign pierc the deep array

threaten nor from the holi one of heaven
refrain hi tongu blasphemous; but anon
down cloven to the waist with shatter arm

uriel and raphael hi vaunt foe
though huge and in a rock of diamond arm
vanquish adramelech and asmadai
two potent throne that to be less than god

nor stood unmind abdiel to annoy

ariel and arioch and the violenc

angel content with their fame in heaven
seek not the prais of men: the other sort
in might though wonder and in act of war

cancel from heaven and sacr memori
nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell
for strength from truth divid and from just

therefor etern silenc be their doom
and now their mightiest quell the battl swerv

not liabl to fear or flight or pain
far otherwis the inviol saint

such high advantag their innoc

not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
unweari unobnoxi to be pain

now night her cours began and over heaven

under her cloudi covert both retir

michael and hi angel preval

far in the dark dislodged; and void of rest
hi potent to council call by night;
and in the midst thu undismay began
o now in danger tri now known in arm
not to be overpow companion dear

who have sustain one day in doubt fight

what heaven lord had powerfullest to send

suffici to subdu us to hi will
but prove not so: then fallibl it seem
of futur we may deem him though till now
omnisci thought true is less firmli arm

sinc now we find thi our empyr form

ruin must need ensue; for what avail

which all subdu and make remiss the hand

spare out of life perhap and not repin
but live content which is the calmest life:
but pain is perfect miseri the worst
of evil and excess overturn
all patienc he who therefor can invent
with what more forcibl we may offend
our yet unwound enemi or arm
ourselv with like defenc to me deserv
no less than for deliver what we owe
whereto with look compos satan repli
not uninv that which thou aright
believest so main to our success i bring
which of us who behold the bright surfac

whose eye so superfici survey
these thing as not to mind from whenc they grow

so beauteou open to the ambient light?
these in their dark nativ the deep

which into hollow engin long and round
thick ram at the other bore with touch of fire
dilat and infuri shall send forth
from far with thunder nois among our foe
such implement of mischief as shall dash

he end and hi word their droop cheer
enlighten and their languish hope reviv
the invent all admir and each how he
to be the invent missed; so easi it seem
onc found which yet unfound most would have thought
impossible: yet hapli of thi race
in futur day if malic should abound
some one intent on mischief or inspir
with devilish machin might devis
like instrument to plagu the son of men
for sin on war and mutual slaughter bent
forthwith from council to the work they flew;
none argu stood; innumer hand
were ready; in a moment up they turn
wide the celesti soil and saw beneath
the origin of natur in their crude
conception; sulphur and nitrou foam
they found they mingl and with subtl art
concoct and adust they reduc
to blackest grain and into store conveyed:
part hidden vein dig up (nor hath thi earth
entrail unlike) of miner and stone
whereof to found their engin and their ball
of missiv ruin; part incent reed
provid pernici with one touch to fire
so all ere day-spr under consciou night
secret they finish and in order set
with silent circumspect unespi
now when fair morn orient in heaven appear
up rose the victor-angel and to arm
the matin trumpet sung: in arm they stood
of golden panopli refulg host
soon banded; other from the dawn hill
look round and scout each coast light-arm scour
each quarter to descri the distant foe
where lodg or whither fled or if for fight
in motion or in halt: him soon they met
under spread ensign move nigh in slow
but firm battalion; back with speediest sail
zophiel of cherubim the swiftest wing
came fli and in mid air aloud thu cri
arm warriour arm for fight; the foe at hand
whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit
thi day; fear not hi flight;so thick a cloud
he come and settl in hi face i see
sad resolut and secure: let each
hi adamantin coat gird well and each
fit well hi helm gripe fast hi orb shield
born even or high; for thi day will pour down
if i conjectur aught no drizzl shower
but rattl storm of arrow barb with fire
so warn he them awar themselv and soon
in order quit of all impediment;
instant without disturb they took alarm
and onward move embattled: when behold!
not distant far with heavi pace the foe
approach gross and huge in hollow cube
train hi devilish engineri impal
on everi side with shadow squadron deep
to hide the fraud at interview both stood
a while; but suddenli at head appear
satan and thu wa heard command loud
vanguard to right and left the front unfold;
that all may see who hate us how we seek
peac and composur and with open breast
stand readi to receiv them if they like
our overture; and turn not back perverse:
but that i doubt; howev wit heaven!
heaven wit thou anon! while we discharg
freeli our part: ye who appoint stand
do as you have in charg and briefli touch
what we propound and loud that all may hear!
so scof in ambigu word he scarc
had ended; when to right and left the front
divid and to either flank retired:
which to our eye discov new and strang
a tripl mount row of pillar laid
on wheel (for like to pillar most they seem
or hollow bodi made of oak or fir
with branch lopt in wood or mountain felled)
brass iron stoni mould had not their mouth
with hideou orific gape on us wide
portend hollow truce: at each behind
a seraph stood and in hi hand a reed
stood wave tipt with fire; while we suspens
collect stood within our thought amus
not long; for sudden all at onc their reed
put forth and to a narrow vent appli
with nicest touch immedi in a flame
but soon obscur with smoke all heaven appear
from those deep-throat engin belch whose roar
embowel with outrag nois the air
and all her entrail tore disgorg foul
their devilish glut chain thunderbolt and hail
of iron globes; which on the victor host
level with such impetu furi smote
that whom they hit none on their feet might stand
though stand els as rock but down they fell
by thousand angel on arch-angel rolled;
the sooner for their arms; unarm they might
have easili as spirit evad swift
by quick contract or remove; but now
foul dissip follow and forc rout;
nor serv it to relax their serri file
what should they do? if on they rush repuls
repeat and indec overthrow
doubl would render them yet more despis
and to their foe a laughter; for in view
stood rank of seraphim anoth row
in postur to displod their second tire
of thunder: back defeat to return
they wors abhor satan beheld their plight
and to hi mate thu in deris call
o friends! whi come not on these victor proud
ere while they fierc were coming; and when we
to entertain them fair with open front
and breast (what could we more?) propound term
of composit straight they chang their mind
flew off and into strang vagari fell
as they would dance; yet for a danc they seem
somewhat extravag and wild; perhap
for joy of offer peace: but i suppos
if our propos onc again were heard
we should compel them to a quick result
to whom thu belial in like gamesom mood
leader! the term we sent were term of weight
of hard content and full of forc urg home;
such as we might perceiv amus them all
and stumbl many: who receiv them right
had need from head to foot well understand;
not understood thi gift they have besid
they show us when our foe walk not upright
so they among themselv in pleasant vein
stood scof highten in their thought beyond
all doubt of victory: etern might
to match with their invent they presum
so easi and of hi thunder made a scorn
and all hi host derid while they stood
a while in trouble: but they stood not long;
rage prompt them at length and found them arm
against such hellish mischief fit to oppos
forthwith (behold the excel the power
which god hath in hi mighti angel placed!)
their arm away they threw and to the hill
(for earth hath thi varieti from heaven
of pleasur situat in hill and dale)
light as the lightn glimps they ran they flew;
from their foundat loosen to and fro
they pluck the seat hill with all their load
rock water wood and by the shaggi top
up-lift bore them in their hands: amaz
be sure and terrour seiz the rebel host
when come toward them so dread they saw
the bottom of the mountain upward turned;
till on those curs engin triple-row
they saw them whelm and all their confid
under the weight of mountain buri deep;
themselv invad next and on their head
main promontori flung which in the air
came shadow and oppress whole legion armed;
their armour help their harm crush in and bruis
into their substanc pent which wrought them pain
implac and mani a dolor groan;
long struggl underneath ere they could wind
out of such prison though spirit of purest light
purest at first now gross by sin grown
the rest in imit to like arm
betook them and the neighbour hill uptore:
so hill amid the air encount hill
hurl to and fro with jacul dire;
that under ground they fought in dismal shade;
infern noise! war seem a civil game
to thi uproar; horrid confus heap
upon confus rose: and now all heaven
had gone to wrack with ruin overspread;
had not the almighti father where he sit
shrine in hi sanctuari of heaven secur
consult on the sum of thing foreseen
thi tumult and permit all advised:
that hi great purpos he might so fulfil
to honour hi anoint son aveng
upon hi enemi and to declar
all power on him transferred: whenc to hi son
the assessour of hi throne he thu began
effulg of my glori son belov
son in whose face invis is beheld
visibl what by deiti i am;
and in whose hand what by decre i do
second omnipotence! two day are past
two day as we comput the day of heaven
sinc michael and hi power went forth to tame
these disobedient: sore hath been their fight
as likeliest wa when two such foe met armed;
for to themselv i left them; and thou knowest
equal in their creation they were form
save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought
insens for i suspend their doom;
whenc in perpetu fight they need must last
endless and no solut will be found:
war weari hath perform what war can do
and to disord rage let loos the rein
with mountain as with weapon armed; which make
wild work in heaven and danger to the main
two day are therefor past the third is thine;
for thee i have ordain it; and thu far
have suffer that the glori may be thine
of end thi great war sinc none but thou
can end it into thee such virtu and grace
immens i have transfus that all may know
in heaven and hell thi power abov compare;
and thi pervers commot govern thu
to manifest thee worthiest to be heir
of all things; to be heir and to be king
by sacr unction thi deserv right
go then thou mightiest in thi father might;
ascend my chariot guid the rapid wheel
that shake heaven basi bring forth all my war
my bow and thunder my almighti arm
gird on and sword upon thi puissant thigh;
pursu these son of dark drive them out
from all heaven bound into the utter deep:
there let them learn as like them to despis
god and messiah hi anoint king
he said and on hi son with ray direct
shone full; he all hi father full express
ineff into hi face received;
and thu the filial godhead answer spake
o father o suprem of heavenli throne
first highest holiest best; thou alway seekst
to glorifi thi son i alway thee
as is most just: thi i my glori account
my exalt and my whole delight
that thou in me well pleas declarest thi will
fulfil which to fulfil is all my bliss
scepter and power thi give i assum
and gladlier shall resign when in the end
thou shalt be all in all and i in thee
for ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:
but whom thou hatest i hate and can put on
thi terrour as i put thi mild on
imag of thee in all things; and shall soon
arm with thi might rid heaven of these rebelled;
to their prepar ill mansion driven down
to chain of dark and the undi worm;
that from thi just obedi could revolt
whom to obey is happi entir
then shall thi saint unmix and from the impur
far separ circl thi holi mount
unfeign halleluiah to thee sing
hymn of high prais and i among them chief
so said he oer hi scepter bow rose
from the right hand of glori where he sat;
and the third sacr morn began to shine
dawn through heaven forth rush with whirlwind sound
the chariot of patern deiti
flash thick flame wheel within wheel undrawn
itself instinct with spirit but convoy
by four cherubick shapes; four face each
had wonderous; as with star their bodi all
and wing were set with eyes; with eye the wheel
of beryl and career fire between;
over their head a crystal firmament
whereon a sapphir throne inlaid with pure
amber and colour of the showeri arch
he in celesti panopli all arm
of radiant urim work divin wrought
ascended; at hi right hand victori
sat eagle-winged; besid him hung hi bow
and quiver with three-bolt thunder stored;
and from about him fierc effus roll
of smoke and bicker flame and sparkl dire:
attend with ten thousand thousand saint
he onward came; far off hi come shone;
and twenti thousand (i their number heard)
chariot of god half on each hand were seen;
he on the wing of cherub rode sublim
on the crystallin sky in sapphir throne
illustri far and wide; but by hi own
first seen: them unexpect joy surpris
when the great ensign of messiah blaze
aloft by angel born hi sign in heaven;
under whose conduct michael soon reduc
hi armi circumfus on either wing
under their head imbodi all in one
befor him power divin hi way prepared;
at hi command the uproot hill retir
each to hi place; they heard hi voic and went
obsequious; heaven hi wont face renew
and with fresh floweret hill and valley smile
thi saw hi hapless foe but stood obdur
and to rebelli fight ralli their power
insens hope conceiv from despair
in heavenli spirit could such pervers dwell?
but to convinc the proud what sign avail
or wonder move the obdur to relent?
they harden more by what might most reclaim
griev to see hi glori at the sight
took envy; and aspir to hi highth
stood re-embattl fierc by forc or fraud
ween to prosper and at length prevail
against god and messiah or to fall
in univers ruin last; and now
to final battl drew disdain flight
or faint retreat; when the great son of god
to all hi host on either hand thu spake
stand still in bright array ye saints; here stand
ye angel armed; thi day from battl rest:
faith hath been your warfar and of god
accept fearless in hi righteou cause;
and as ye have receiv so have ye done
invincibly: but of thi curs crew
the punish to other hand belongs;
vengeanc is hi or whose he sole appoints:
number to thi day work is not ordain
nor multitude; stand onli and behold
god indign on these godless pour
by me; not you but me they have despis
yet envied; against me is all their rage
becaus the father to whom in heaven spreme
kingdom and power and glori appertain
hath honour me accord to hi will
therefor to me their doom he hath assigned;
that they may have their wish to tri with me
in battl which the stronger proves; they all
or i alon against them; sinc by strength
they measur all of other excel
not emul nor care who them excels;
nor other strife with them do i vouchsaf
so spake the son and into terrour chang
hi counten too sever to be beheld
and full of wrath bent on hi enemi
at onc the four spread out their starri wing
with dread shade contigu and the orb
of hi fierc chariot roll as with the sound
of torrent flood or of a numer host
he on hi impiou foe right onward drove
gloomi as night; under hi burn wheel
the stedfast empyrean shook throughout
all but the throne itself of god full soon
among them he arrived; in hi right hand
grasp ten thousand thunder which he sent
befor him such as in their soul infix
plagues: they astonish all resist lost
all courage; down their idl weapon dropt:
oer shield and helm and helm head he rode
of throne and mighti seraphim prostrat
that wish the mountain now might be again
thrown on them as a shelter from hi ire
nor less on either side tempestu fell
hi arrow from the fourfold-visag four
distinct with eye and from the live wheel
distinct alik with multitud of eyes;
one spirit in them ruled; and everi eye
glare lightn and shot forth pernici fire
among the accurs that wither all their strength
and of their wont vigour left them drain
exhaust spiritless afflict fallen
yet half hi strength he put not forth but check
hi thunder in mid volley; for he meant
not to destroy but root them out of heaven:
the overthrown he rais and as a herd
of goat or timor flock togeth throng
drove them befor him thunder-struck pursu
with terrour and with furi to the bound
and crystal wall of heaven; which open wide
roll inward and a spaciou gap disclos
into the wast deep: the monstrou sight
struck them with horrour backward but far wors
urg them behind: headlong themselv they threw
down from the verg of heaven; etern wrath
burnt after them to the bottomless pit
hell heard the unsuffer nois hell saw
heaven ruin from heaven and would have fled
affrighted; but strict fate had cast too deep
her dark foundat and too fast had bound
nine day they fell: confound chao roar
and felt tenfold confus in their fall
through hi wild anarchi so huge a rout
incumb him with ruin: hell at last
yawn receiv them whole and on them closed;
hell their fit habit fraught with fire
unquench the hous of woe and pain
disburden heaven rejoic and soon repair
her mural breach return whenc it roll
sole victor from the expuls of hi foe
messiah hi triumphal chariot turned:
to meet him all hi saint who silent stood
eye-wit of hi almighti act
with jubile advanced; and as they went
shade with branch palm each order bright
sung triumph and him sung victori king
son heir and lord to him dominion given
worthiest to reign: he celebr rode
triumphant through mid heaven into the court
and templ of hi mighti father throne
on high; who into glori him receiv
where now he sit at the right hand of bliss
thu measur thing in heaven by thing on earth
at thi request and that thou mayest bewar
by what is past to thee i have reveal
what might have els to human race been hid;
the discord which befel and war in heaven
among the angelick power and the deep fall
of those too high aspir who rebel
with satan; he who envi now thi state
who now is plot how he may seduc

which would be all hi solac and reveng
as a despit done against the most high

but listen not to hi temptat warn

descend from heaven urania by that name
if rightli thou art call whose voic divin

in presenc of the almighti father pleas
with thi celesti song up led by thee
into the heaven of heaven i have presum

lest from thi fli steed unrein (a onc

on evil day though fallen and evil tongues;
in dark and with danger compass round
and solitude; yet not alon while thou
visitest my slumber nightli or when morn
purpl the east: still govern thou my song
urania and fit audienc find though few
but drive far off the barbar disson
of bacchu and hi revel the race
of that wild rout that tore the thracian bard
in rhodop where wood and rock had ear
to raptur till the savag clamour drown
both harp and voice; nor could the muse defend
her son so fail not thou who thee implores:
for thou art heavenli she an empti dream
say goddess what ensu when raphael
the affabl arch-angel had forewarn
adam by dire exampl to bewar
apostasi by what befel in heaven
to those apostates; lest the like befal

if they transgress and slight that sole command
so easili obey amid the choic

though wander he with hi consort eve
the stori heard attent and wa fill
with admir and deep muse to hear

so unimagin as hate in heaven
and war so near the peac of god in bliss
with such confusion: but the evil soon
driven back redound as a flood on those
from whom it sprung; imposs to mix
with blessed whenc adam soon repeal
the doubt that in hi heart arose: and now
led on yet sinless with desir to know
what nearer might concern him how thi world
of heaven and earth conspicu first began;
when and whereof created; for what cause;
what within eden or without wa done
befor hi memory; as one whose drouth
yet scarc allay still eye the current stream
whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excit
proceed thu to ask hi heavenli guest
great thing and full of wonder in our ear
far differ from thi world thou hast reveal
divin interpreter! by favour sent
down from the empyrean to forewarn
us time of what might els have been our loss
unknown which human knowledg could not reach;
for which to the infinit good we owe

of what we are but sinc thou hast vouchsaf
gentli for our instruct to impart
thing abov earthli thought which yet concern
our know as to highest wisdom seem
deign to descend now lower and relat
what may no less perhap avail us known
how first began thi heaven which we behold
distant so high with move fire adorn
innumerable; and thi which yield or fill
all space the ambient air wide interfus
embrac round thi flori earth; what caus
move the creator in hi holi rest
through all etern so late to build
in chaos; and the work begun how soon
absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold
what we not to explor the secret ask
of hi etern empir but the more
to magnifi hi work the more we know
and the great light of day yet want to run
much of hi race though steep; suspens in heaven
held by thi voic thi potent voic he hear
and longer will delay to hear thee tell
hi gener and the rise birth
of natur from the unappar deep:
or if the star of even and the moon
hast to thi audienc night with her will bring
silence; and sleep listen to thee will watch;
or we can bid hi absenc till thi song
end and dismiss thee ere the morn shine
thu adam hi illustri guest besought:
and thu the godlik angel answer mild
thi also thi request with caution ask
obtain; though to recount almighti work
what word or tongu of seraph can suffic
or heart of man suffic to comprehend?
yet what thou canst attain which best may serv
to glorifi the maker and infer
thee also happier shall not be withheld
thi hearing; such commiss from abov
i have receiv to answer thi desir
of knowledg within bounds; beyond abstain
to ask; nor let thine own invent hope
thing not reveal which the invis king
onli omnisci hath suppress in night;
to none communic in earth or heaven:
enough is left besid to search and know
but knowledg is as food and need no less
her temper over appetit to know
in measur what the mind may well contain;
oppress els with surfeit and soon turn
wisdom to folli as nourish to wind
know then that after lucif from heaven
(so call him brighter onc amidst the host
of angel than that star the star among)
fell with hi flame legion through the deep
into hi place and the great son return
victori with hi saint the omnipot
etern father from hi throne beheld
their multitud and to hi son thu spake
at least our enviou foe hath fail who thought
all like himself rebelli by whose aid
thi inaccess high strength the seat
of deiti suprem us dispossess
he trust to have seis and into fraud
drew mani whom their place know here no more:
yet far the greater part have kept i see
their station; heaven yet popul retain
number suffici to possess her realm
though wide and thi high templ to frequent
with ministeri due and solemn rites:
but lest hi heart exalt him in the harm
alreadi done to have dispeopl heaven
my damag fondli deem i can repair
that detriment if such it be to lose
self-lost; and in a moment will creat
anoth world out of one man a race
of men innumer there to dwell
not here; till by degre of merit rais
they open to themselv at length the way
up hither under long obedi tried;
and earth be chang to heaven and heaven to earth
one kingdom joy and union without end

and thou my word begotten son by thee

and put not forth my good which is free
to act or not necess and chanc
approach not me and what i will is fate
so spake the almighti and to what he spake
hi word the filial godhead gave effect
immedi are the act of god more swift
than time or motion but to human ear
cannot without process of speech be told
so told as earthli notion can receiv
great triumph and rejoic wa in heaven
when such wa heard declar the almighti will;
glori they sung to the most high good will
to futur men and in their dwell peace;
glori to him whose just aveng ire
had driven out the ungodli from hi sight
and the habit of the just; to him
glori and prais whose wisdom had ordain
good out of evil to create; instead
of spirit malign a better race to bring
into their vacant room and thenc diffus
hi good to world and age infinit
so sang the hierarchies: mean while the son
on hi great expedit now appear
girt with omnipot with radianc crown
of majesti divine; sapienc and love
immens and all hi father in him shone
about hi chariot numberless were pour
cherub and seraph potent and throne
and virtu wing spirit and chariot wing
from the armouri of god; where stand of old
myriad between two brazen mountain lodg
against a solemn day har at hand
celesti equipage; and now came forth
spontan for within them spirit live
attend on their lord: heaven open wide
her ever-dur gate harmoni sound
on golden hing move to let forth
the king of glori in hi power word
and spirit come to creat new world
on heavenli ground they stood; and from the shore
they view the vast immeasur abyss
outrag as a sea dark wast wild
up from the bottom turn by furiou wind
and surg wave as mountain to assault
heaven highth and with the center mix the pole
silenc ye troubl wave and thou deep peac
said then the omnifick word; your discord end!
nor staid; but on the wing of cherubim
uplift in patern glori rode
far into chao and the world unborn;
for chao heard hi voice: him all hi train
follow in bright process to behold
creation and the wonder of hi might
then staid the fervid wheel and in hi hand
he took the golden compass prepar
in god etern store to circumscrib
thi univers and all creat things:
one foot he center and the other turn
round through the vast profund obscure;
and said thu far extend thu far thi bound
thi be thi just circumfer o world!
thu god the heaven creat thu the earth
matter unform and void: dark profound
cover the abyss: but on the wateri calm
hi brood wing the spirit of god outspread
and vital virtu infus and vital warmth
throughout the fluid mass; but downward purg
the black tartar cold infern dreg
advers to life: then found then conglob
like thing to like; the rest to sever place
dispart and between spun out the air;
and earth self-balanc on her center hung
let there be light said god; and forthwith light
ether first of thing quintess pure
sprung from the deep; and from her nativ east
to journey through the aeri gloom began
sphere in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
wa not; she in a cloudi tabernacl
sojourn the while god saw the light wa good;
and light from dark by the hemispher
divided: light the day and dark night
he name thu wa the first day even and morn:
nor past uncelebr nor unsung
by the celesti quir when orient light
exhal first from dark they beheld;
birth-day of heaven and earth; with joy and shout
the hollow univers orb they fill
and touch their golden harp and hymn prais
god and hi works; creator him they sung
both when first even wa and when first morn
again god said let there be firmament
amid the water and let it divid
the water from the waters; and god made
the firmament expans of liquid pure
transpar element air diffus
in circuit to the uttermost convex
of thi great round; partit firm and sure
the water underneath from those abov
dividing: for as earth so he the world
built on circumflu water calm in wide
crystallin ocean and the loud misrul
of chao far removed; lest fierc extrem
contigu might distemp the whole frame:
and heaven he name the firmament: so even
and morn choru sung the second day
the earth wa form but in the womb as yet
of water embryon immatur involv
appear not: over all the face of earth
main ocean flow not idle; but with warm
prolifick humour soften all her globe
ferment the great mother to conceiv
satiat with genial moisture; when god said
be gather now ye water under heaven
into one place and let dri land appear
immedi the mountain huge appear
emerg and their broad bare back upheav
into the clouds; their top ascend the sky:
so high as heav the tumid hill so low
down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep
capaci bed of waters: thither they
hast with glad precipit uprol
as drop on dust conglob from the dry:
part rise in crystal wall or ridg direct
for haste; such flight the great command impress
on the swift floods: as armi at the call
of trumpet (for of armi thou hast heard)
troop to their standard; so the wateri throng
wave roll after wave where way they found
if steep with torrent raptur if through plain
soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;
but they or under ground or circuit wide
with serpent errour wander found their way
and on the washi oos deep channel wore;
easi ere god had bid the ground be dri
all but within those bank where river now
stream and perpetu draw their humid train
the dri land earth; and the great receptacl
of congreg water he call seas:
and saw that it wa good; and said let the earth
put forth the verdant grass herb yield seed
and fruit-tre yield fruit after her kind
whose seed is in herself upon the earth
he scarc had said when the bare earth till then
desart and bare unsightli unadorn
brought forth the tender grass whose verdur clad
her univers face with pleasant green;
then herb of everi leaf that sudden flower
open their variou colour and made gay
her bosom smell sweet: and these scarc blown
forth flourish thick the cluster vine forth crept
the swell gourd up stood the corni reed
embattl in her field and the humbl shrub
and bush with frizzl hair implicit: last
rose as in danc the state tree and spread
their branch hung with copiou fruit or gem
their blossoms: with high wood the hill were crowned;
with tuft the valley and each fountain side;
with border long the rivers: that earth now
seem like to heaven a seat where god might dwell
or wander with delight and love to haunt
her sacr shades: though god had yet not rain
upon the earth and man to till the ground
none was; but from the earth a dewi mist
went up and water all the ground and each
plant of the field; which ere it wa in the earth
god made and everi herb befor it grew
on the green stem: god saw that it wa good:
so even and morn record the third day
again the almighti spake let there be light
high in the expans of heaven to divid
the day from night; and let them be for sign
for season and for day and circl years;
and let them be for light as i ordain
their offic in the firmament of heaven
to give light on the earth; and it wa so
and god made two great light great for their use
to man the greater to have rule by day
the less by night altern; and made the star
and set them in the firmament of heaven
to illumin the earth and rule the day
in their vicissitud and rule the night
and light from dark to divid god saw
survey hi great work that it wa good:
for of celesti bodi first the sun
a mighti sphere he frame unlightsom first
though of ether mould: then form the moon
globos and everi magnitud of star
and sow with star the heaven thick as a field:
of light by far the greater part he took
transplant from her cloudi shrine and place
in the sun orb made porou to receiv
and drink the liquid light; firm to retain
her gather beam great palac now of light
hither as to their fountain other star
repair in their golden urn draw light
and henc the morning-planet gild her horns;
by tinctur or reflect they augment
their small peculiar though from human sight
so far remot with diminut seen
first in hi east the gloriou lamp wa seen
regent of day and all the horizon round
invest with bright ray jocund to run
hi longitud through heaven high road; the gray
dawn and the pleiad befor him danc
shed sweet influence: less bright the moon
but opposit in level west wa set
hi mirrour with full face borrow her light
from him; for other light she need none
in that aspect and still that distanc keep
till night; then in the east her turn she shine
revolv on heaven great axl and her reign
with thousand lesser light dividu hold
with thousand thousand star that then appear
spangl the hemisphere: then first adorn
with their bright luminari that set and rose
glad even and glad morn crown the fourth day
and god said let the water gener
reptil with spawn abund live soul:
and let fowl fli abov the earth with wing
display on the open firmament of heaven
and god creat the great whale and each
soul live each that crept which plenteous
the water gener by their kinds;
and everi bird of wing after hi kind;
and saw that it wa good and bless them say
be fruit multipli and in the sea
and lake and run stream the water fill;
and let the fowl be multipli on the earth
forthwith the sound and sea each creek and bay
with fri innumer swarm and shoal
of fish that with their fin and shine scale
glide under the green wave in scull that oft
bank the mid sea: part singl or with mate
graze the sea-we their pastur and through grove
of coral stray; or sport with quick glanc
show to the sun their wave coat dropt with gold;
or in their pearli shell at eas attend
moist nutriment; or under rock their food
in joint armour watch: on smooth the seal
and bend dolphin play: part huge of bulk
wallow unwieldi enorm in their gait
tempest the ocean: there leviathan
hugest of live creatur on the deep
stretch like a promontori sleep or swim
and seem a move land; and at hi gill
draw in and at hi trunk spout out a sea
mean while the tepid cave and fen and shore
their brood as numer hatch from the egg that soon
burst with kindli ruptur forth disclos
their callow young; but feather soon and fledg
they sum their pens; and soar the air sublim
with clang despis the ground under a cloud
in prospect; there the eagl and the stork
on cliff and cedar top their eyri build:
part loos wing the region part more wise
in common rang in figur wedg their way
intellig of season and set forth
their aeri caravan high over sea
fli and over land with mutual wing
eas their flight; so steer the prudent crane
her annual voyag born on winds; the air
float as they pass fan with unnumb plumes:
from branch to branch the smaller bird with song
solac the wood and spread their paint wing
till even; nor then the solemn nightingal
ceas warbl but all night tund her soft lays:
other on silver lake and river bath
their downi breast; the swan with arch neck
between her white wing mantl proudli row
her state with oari feet; yet oft they quit
the dank and rise on stiff pennon tower
the mid aereal sky: other on ground
walk firm; the crest cock whose clarion sound
the silent hour and the other whose gay train
adorn him colour with the florid hue
of rainbow and starri eye the water thu
with fish replenish and the air with fowl
even and morn solemn the fifth day
the sixth and of creation last aros
with even harp and matin; when god said
let the earth bring forth soul live in her kind
cattl and creep thing and beast of the earth
each in their kind the earth obey and straight
open her fertil womb teem at a birth
innumer live creatur perfect form
limb and full grown: out of the ground up rose
as from hi lair the wild beast where he won
in forest wild in thicket brake or den;
among the tree in pair they rose they walked:
the cattl in the field and meadow green:
those rare and solitari these in flock
pastur at onc and in broad herd upsprung
the grassi clod now calved; now half appear
the tawni lion paw to get free
hi hinder part then spring as broke from bond
and rampant shake hi brind mane; the ounc
the libbard and the tiger as the mole
rise the crumbl earth abov them threw
in hillocks: the swift stag from under ground
bore up hi branch head: scarc from hi mould
behemoth biggest born of earth upheav
hi vastness: fleec the flock and bleat rose
as plants: ambigu between sea and land
the river-hors and scali crocodil
at onc came forth whatev creep the ground
insect or worm: those wave their limber fan
for wing and smallest lineament exact
in all the liveri deck of summer pride
with spot of gold and purpl azur and green:
these as a line their long dimens drew
streak the ground with sinuou trace; not all
minim of nature; some of serpent-kind
wonder in length and corpul involv
their snaki fold and ad wing first crept
the parsimoni emmet provid
of future; in small room larg heart enclosed;
pattern of just equal perhap
hereaft join in her popular tribe
of commonalty: swarm next appear
the femal bee that feed her husband drone
delici and build her waxen cell
with honey stored: the rest are numberless
and thou their natur knowest and gavest them name
needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
the serpent subtlest beast of all the field
of huge extent sometim with brazen eye
and hairi mane terrifick though to thee
not noxiou but obedi at thi call
now heaven in all her glori shone and roll
her motion as the great first mover hand
first wheel their course: earth in her rich attir
consumm love smiled; air water earth
by fowl fish beast wa flown wa swum wa walk
frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:
there want yet the master-work the end
of all yet done; a creatur who not prone
and brute as other creatur but endu
with sanctiti of reason might erect
hi statur and upright with front seren
govern the rest self-knowing; and from thenc
magnanim to correspond with heaven
but grate to acknowledg whenc hi good
descend thither with heart and voic and eye
direct in devot to ador
and worship god suprem who made him chief
of all hi works: therefor the omnipot
etern father (for where is not he
present?) thu to hi son audibl spake
let us make now man in our imag man
in our similitud and let them rule
over the fish and fowl of sea and air
beast of the field and over all the earth
and everi creep thing that creep the ground
thi said he form thee adam thee o man
dust of the ground and in thi nostril breath
the breath of life; in hi own imag he
creat thee in the imag of god
express; and thou becamest a live soul
male he creat thee; but thi consort
femal for race; then bless mankind and said
be fruit multipli and fill the earth;
subdu it and throughout dominion hold
over fish of the sea and fowl of the air
and everi live thing that move on the earth
wherev thu creat for no place
is yet distinct by name thenc as thou knowest
he brought thee into thi delici grove
thi garden plant with the tree of god
delect both to behold and taste;
and freeli all their pleasant fruit for food
gave thee; all sort are here that all the earth yield
varieti without end; but of the tree
which tast work knowledg of good and evil
thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest thou diest;
death is the penalti imposed; bewar
and govern well thi appetite; lest sin
surpris thee and her black attend death
here finish he and all that he had made
view and behold all wa entir good;
so even and morn accomplish the sixth day:
yet not till the creator from hi work
desist though unweari up return
up to the heaven of heaven hi high abode;
thenc to behold thi new creat world
the addit of hi empir how it show
in prospect from hi throne how good how fair
answer hi great idea up he rode
follow with acclam and the sound
symphoni of ten thousand harp that tune
angelick harmonies: the earth the air
resound (thou rememberest for thou heardst)
the heaven and all the constel rung
the planet in their station listen stood
while the bright pomp ascend jubil
open ye everlast gates! they sung
open ye heavens! your live doors;let in
the great creator from hi work return
magnific hi six day work a world;
open and henceforth oft; for god will deign
to visit oft the dwell of just men
delighted; and with frequent intercours
thither will send hi wing messeng
on errand of supern grace so sung
the gloriou train ascending: he through heaven
that open wide her blaze portal led
to god etern hous direct the way;
a broad and ampl road whose dust is gold
and pavement star as star to thee appear
seen in the galaxi that milki way
which nightli as a circl zone thou seest
powder with star and now on earth the seventh
even aros in eden for the sun
wa set and twilight from the east came on
forerun night; when at the holi mount
of heaven high-seat top the imperi throne
of godhead fix for ever firm and sure
the filial power arriv and sat him down
with hi great father; for he also went
invis yet staid (such privileg
hath omnipresence) and the work ordain
author and end of all things; and from work
now rest bless and hallow the seventh day
as rest on that day from all hi work
but not in silenc holi kept: the harp
had work and rest not; the solemn pipe
and dulcim all organ of sweet stop
all sound on fret by string or golden wire
temper soft tune intermix with voic
choral or unison: of incens cloud
fume from golden censer hid the mount
creation and the six day act they sung:
great are thi work jehovah! infinit
thi power! what thought can measur thee or tongu

which onli thi solut can resolv
when i behold thi goodli frame thi world
of heaven and earth consisting; and comput

and all her number star that seem to roll

diurnal) mere to offici light
round thi opac earth thi punctual spot
one day and night; in all her vast survey
useless besides; reason i oft admir
how natur wise and frugal could commit
such disproport with superflu hand
so mani nobler bodi to creat
greater so manifold to thi one use
for aught appear and on their orb impos
such restless revolut day by day
repeated; while the sedentari earth
that better might with far less compass move

her end without least motion and receiv
as tribut such a sumless journey brought

so spake our sire and by hi counten seem

perceiv where she sat retir in sight
with lowli majestick from her seat
and grace that won who saw to wish her stay
rose and went forth among her fruit and flower
to visit how they prosper bud and bloom
her nursery; they at her come sprung
and touch by her fair tendanc gladlier grew
yet went she not as not with such discours
delight or not capabl her ear
of what wa high: such pleasur she reserv
adam relat she sole auditress;
her husband the relat she prefer
befor the angel and of him to ask
chose rather; he she knew would intermix
grate digress and solv high disput
with conjug caresses: from hi lip
not word alon pleas her o! when meet now
such pair in love and mutual honour joined?
with goddess-lik demeanour forth she went
not unattended; for on her as queen
a pomp of win grace wait still
and from about her shot dart of desir
into all eye to wish her still in sight
and raphael now to adam doubt propos
benevol and facil thu repli
to ask or search i blame thee not; for heaven
is as the book of god befor thee set
wherein to read hi wonder work and learn
hi season hour or day or month or years:
thi to attain whether heaven move or earth
import not if thou reckon right; the rest
from man or angel the great architect
did wise to conceal and not divulg
hi secret to be scan by them who ought
rather admire; or if they list to tri
conjectur he hi fabrick of the heaven
hath left to their disput perhap to move
hi laughter at their quaint opinion wide
hereafter; when they come to model heaven
and calcul the star how they will wield
the mighti frame; how build unbuild contriv
to save appearances; how gird the sphere
with centrick and eccentrick scribbl oer
cycl and epicycl orb in orb:
alreadi by thi reason thi i guess
who art to lead thi offspr and supposest
that bodi bright and greater should not serv
the less not bright nor heaven such journey run
earth sit still when she alon receiv
the benefit: consid first that great

though in comparison of heaven so small
nor glister may of solid good contain
more plenti than the sun that barren shines;
whose virtu on itself work no effect
but in the fruit earth; there first receiv
hi beam unact els their vigour find
yet not to earth are those bright luminari
officious; but to thee earth habit
and for the heaven wide circuit let it speak
the maker high magnific who built
so spaciou and hi line stretch out so far;
that man may know he dwell not in hi own;
an edific too larg for him to fill
lodg in a small partition; and the rest
ordain for use to hi lord best known
the swift of those circl attribut
though numberless to hi omnipot
that to corpor substanc could add

who sinc the morning-hour set out from heaven
where god resid and ere mid-day arriv

by number that have name but thi i urg
admit motion in the heaven to show
invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;
not that i so affirm though so it seem
to thee who hast thi dwell here on earth
god to remov hi way from human sens
place heaven from earth so far that earthli sight
if it presum might err in thing too high
and no advantag gain what if the sun

their wander cours now high now low then hid
progress retrograd or stand still
in six thou seest; and what if seventh to these
the planet earth so stedfast though she seem
insens three differ motion move?
which els to sever sphere thou must ascrib
move contrari with thwart obliquities;
or save the sun hi labour and that swift
nocturn and diurnal rhomb suppos
invis els abov all star the wheel
of day and night; which need not thi belief
if earth industri of herself fetch day
travel east and with her part avers
from the sun beam meet night her other part
still lumin by hi ray what if that light
sent from her through the wide transpicu air
to the terrestri moon be as a star
enlighten her by day as she by night

as cloud and cloud may rain and rain produc

which two great sex anim the world

for such vast room in natur unpossess
by live soul desart and desol
onli to shine yet scarc to contribut
each orb a glimps of light convey so far
down to thi habit which return
light back to them is obviou to disput
but whether thu these thing or whether not;
but whether the sun predomin in heaven
rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;
he from the east hi flame road begin;
or she from west her silent cours advanc
with inoffens pace that spin sleep
on her soft axl while she pace even
and bear thee soft with the smooth hair along;
sollicit not thi thought with matter hid;
leav them to god above; him serv and fear!
of other creatur as him pleas best
wherev place let him dispose; joy thou
in what he give to thee thi paradis
and thi fair eve; heaven is for thee too high
to know what pass there; be lowli wise:
think onli what concern thee and thi being;
dream not of other world what creatur there
live in what state condit or degree;
content that thu far hath been reveal
not of earth onli but of highest heaven
to whom thu adam clear of doubt repli
how fulli hast thou satisfi me pure

and freed from intricaci taught to live
the easiest way; nor with perplex thought
to interrupt the sweet of life from which
god hath bid dwell far off all anxiou care
and not molest us; unless we ourselv
seek them with wander thought and notion vain
but apt the mind or fanci is to rove
uncheck and of her rove is no end;
till warn or by experi taught she learn
that not to know at larg of thing remot
from use obscur and subtle; but to know
that which befor us lie in daili life
is the prime wisdom: what is more is fume
or empti or fond impertinence:
and render us in thing that most concern
unpractis unprepar and still to seek
therefor from thi high pitch let us descend
a lower flight and speak of thing at hand
useful; whenc hapli mention may aris
of someth not unseason to ask
by suffer and thi wont favour deign
thee i have heard relat what wa done
ere my remembrance: now hear me relat
my stori which perhap thou hast not heard;
and day is not yet spent; till then thou seest
how subtli to detain thee i devise;
invit thee to hear while i relate;
fond! were it not in hope of thi reply:
for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven;
and sweeter thi discours is to my ear
than fruit of palm-tre pleasantest to thirst
and hunger both from labour at the hour
of sweet repast; they satiat and soon fill
though pleasant; but thi word with grace divin
imbu bring to their sweet no satieti
to whom thu raphael answer heavenli meek
nor are thi lip ungrac sire of men
nor tongu ineloquent; for god on thee
abundantli hi gift hath also pour
inward and outward both hi imag fair:
speak or mute all comeli and grace
attend thee; and each word each motion forms;
nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth
than of our fellow-serv and inquir
gladli into the way of god with man:
for god we see hath honour thee and set
on man hi equal love: say therefor on;
for i that day wa absent as befel
bound on a voyag uncouth and obscur
far on excurs toward the gate of hell;
squar in full legion (such command we had)
to see that none thenc issu forth a spi
or enemi while god wa in hi work;
lest he incens at such erupt bold
destruct with creation might have mix
not that they durst without hi leav attempt;
but us he send upon hi high behest
for state as sovran king; and to inur
our prompt obedi fast we found fast shut
the dismal gate and barricado strong;
but long ere our approach heard within
nois other than the sound of danc or song
torment and loud lament and furiou rage
glad we return up to the coast of light
ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charg
but thi relat now; for i attend
pleas with thi word no less than thou with mine
so spake the godlik power and thu our sire
for man to tell how human life began
is hard; for who himself begin knew
desir with thee still longer to convers
induc me as new wake from soundest sleep
soft on the floweri herb i found me laid
in balmi sweat; which with hi beam the sun
soon dri and on the reek moistur fed
straight toward heaven my wonder eye i turn
and gaze a while the ampl sky; till rais
by quick instinct motion up i sprung
as thitherward endeavour and upright
stood on my feet: about me round i saw
hill dale and shadi wood and sunni plain
and liquid laps of murmur streams; by these
creatur that live and move and walk or flew;
bird on the branch warbling; all thing smiled;
with fragranc and with joy my heart oerflow
myself i then perus and limb by limb
survey and sometim went and sometim ran
with suppl joint as live vigour led:
but who i wa or where or from what caus
knew not; to speak i tri and forthwith spake;
my tongu obey and readili could name
whateer i saw thou sun said i fair light
and thou enlighten earth so fresh and gay
ye hill and dale ye river wood and plain
and ye that live and move fair creatur tell
tell if ye saw how i came thu how here?--
not of myself;--bi some great maker then
in good and in power pre-eminent:
tell me how may i know him how ador
from whom i have that thu i move and live
and feel that i am happier than i know--
while thu i call and stray i knew not whither
from where i first drew air and first beheld
thi happi light; when answer none return
on a green shadi bank profus of flower
pensiv i sat me down: there gentl sleep
first found me and with soft oppress seis
my drous sens untroubl though i thought
i then wa pass to my former state
insens and forthwith to dissolve:
when suddenli stood at my head a dream
whose inward apparit gentli move
my fanci to believ i yet had be
and lived: one came methought of shape divin
and said thi mansion want thee adam; rise
first man of men innumer ordain
first father! call by thee i come thi guid
to the garden of bliss thi seat prepar
so say by the hand he took me rais
and over field and water as in air
smooth-slid without step last led me up
a woodi mountain; whose high top wa plain
a circuit wide enclos with goodliest tree
plant with walk and bowers; that what i saw
of earth befor scarc pleasant seem each tree
loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
tempt stir in me sudden appetit
to pluck and eat; whereat i wake and found
befor mine eye all real as the dream
had live shadowed: here had new begun
my wander had not he who wa my guid
up hither from among the tree appear
presenc divin rejoic but with awe
in ador at hi feet i fell
submiss: he rear me and whom thou soughtest i am
said mildli author of all thi thou seest
abov or round about thee or beneath
thi paradis i give thee count it thine
to till and keep and of the fruit to eat:
of everi tree that in the garden grow
eat freeli with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
but of the tree whose oper bring
knowledg of good and ill which i have set
the pledg of thi obedi and thi faith
amid the garden by the tree of life
rememb what i warn thee shun to tast
and shun the bitter consequence: for know
the day thou eatest thereof my sole command
transgress inevit thou shalt die
from that day mortal; and thi happi state
shalt lose expel from henc into a world
of woe and sorrow sternli he pronounc
the rigid interdict which resound
yet dread in mine ear though in my choic
not to incur; but soon hi clear aspect
return and graciou purpos thu renew
not onli these fair bound but all the earth
to thee and to thi race i give; as lord
possess it and all thing that therein live
or live in sea or air; beast fish and fowl
in sign whereof each bird and beast behold
after their kinds; i bring them to receiv
from thee their name and pay thee fealti
with low subjection; understand the same
of fish within their wateri resid
not hither summon sinc they cannot chang
their element to draw the thinner air
as thu he spake each bird and beast behold
approach two and two; these cower low
with blandishment; each bird stoop on hi wing
i name them as they pass and understood
their natur with such knowledg god endu
my sudden apprehension: but in these
i found not what methought i want still;
and to the heavenli vision thu presum
o by what name for thou abov all these
abov mankind or aught than mankind higher
surpassest far my naming; how may i
ador thee author of thi univers
and all thi good to man? for whose well be
so ampli and with hand so liber
thou hast provid all things: but with me
i see not who partak in solitud
what happi who can enjoy alon
or all enjoy what content find?
thu i presumptuous; and the vision bright
as with a smile more brighten thu repli
what callest thou solitude? is not the earth
with variou live creatur and the air
replenish and all these at thi command
to come and play befor thee? knowest thou not
their languag and their ways? they also know
and reason not contemptibly: with these
find pastim and bear rule; thi realm is larg
so spake the univers lord and seem
so ordering: i with leav of speech implor
and humbl deprec thu repli
let not my word offend thee heavenli power;
my maker be propiti while i speak
hast thou not made me here thi substitut
and these inferiour far beneath me set?
among unequ what societi
can sort what harmoni or true delight?
which must be mutual in proport due
given and received; but in dispar
the one intens the other still remiss
cannot well suit with either but soon prove
tediou alike: of fellowship i speak
such as i seek fit to particip
all ration delight: wherein the brute
cannot be human consort: they rejoic
each with their kind lion with lioness;
so fitli them in pair thou hast combined:
much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
so well convers nor with the ox the ape;
wors then can man with beast and least of all
whereto the almighti answer not displeas
a nice and subtl happi i see
thou to thyself proposest in the choic
of thi associ adam! and wilt tast
no pleasur though in pleasur solitari
what thinkest thou then of me and thi my state?
seem i to thee suffici possess
of happi or not? who am alon
from all eternity; for none i know
second to me or like equal much less
how have i then with whom to hold convers
save with the creatur which i made and those
to me inferiour infinit descent
beneath what other creatur are to thee?
he ceased; i lowli answer to attain
the highth and depth of thi etern way
all human thought come short suprem of things!
thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
is no defici found: not so is man
but in degree; the caus of hi desir
by convers with hi like to help
or solac hi defect no need that thou
shouldst propag alreadi infinite;
and through all number absolut though one:
but man by number is to manifest
hi singl imperfect and beget
like of hi like hi imag multipli
in uniti defective; which requir
collater love and dearest amiti
thou in thi secresi although alon
best with thyself accompani seekest not
social communication; yet so pleas
canst rais thi creatur to what highth thou wilt
of union or communion deified:
i by convers cannot these erect
from prone; nor in their way complac find
thu i embolden spake and freedom use
permiss and accept found; which gain
thi answer from the graciou voic divin
thu far to tri thee adam i wa pleased;
and find thee know not of beast alon
which thou hast rightli name but of thyself;
express well the spirit within thee free
my imag not impart to the brute;
whose fellowship therefor unmeet for thee
good reason wa thou freeli shouldst dislike;
and be so mind still: i ere thou spakest
knew it not good for man to be alone;
and no such compani as then thou sawest
intend thee; for trial onli brought
to see how thou couldest judg of fit and meet:
what next i bring shall pleas thee be assur
thi like thi fit help thi other self
thi wish exactli to thi heart desir
he end or i heard no more; for now
my earthli by hi heavenli overpow
which it had long stood under strain to the highth
in that celesti colloquy sublim
as with an object that excel the sens
dazzl and spent sunk down; and sought repair
of sleep which instantli fell on me call
by natur as in aid and close mine eye
mine eye he close but open left the cell
of fanci my intern sight; by which
abstract as in a tranc methought i saw
though sleep where i lay and saw the shape
still gloriou befor whom awak i stood:
who stoop open my left side and took
from thenc a rib with cordial spirit warm
and life-blood stream fresh; wide wa the wound
but suddenli with flesh fill up and healed:
the rib he form and fashion with hi hands;
under hi form hand a creatur grew
man-lik but differ sex; so love fair
that what seem fair in all the world seem now
mean or in her sum up in her contain
and in her looks; which from that time infus
sweet into my heart unfelt befor
and into all thing from her air inspir
the spirit of love and amor delight
she disappear and left me dark; i wake
to find her or for ever to deplor
her loss and other pleasur all abjure:
when out of hope behold her not far off
such as i saw her in my dream adorn
with what all earth or heaven could bestow
to make her amiable: on she came
led by her heavenli maker though unseen
and guid by hi voice; nor uninform
of nuptial sanctiti and marriag rites:
grace wa in all her step heaven in her eye
in everi gestur digniti and love
i overjoy could not forbear aloud
thi turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfil
thi word creator bounteou and benign
giver of all thing fair! but fairest thi
of all thi gifts! nor enviest i now see
bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
befor me: woman is her name;of man
extracted: for thi caus he shall forego
father and mother and to hi wife adhere;
and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul
she heard me thus; and though divin brought
yet innoc and virgin modesti
her virtu and the conscienc of her worth
that would be woo and not unsought be won
not obviou not obtrus but retir
the more desirable; or to say all
natur herself though pure of sin thought
wrought in her so that see me she turned:
i follow her; she what wa honour knew
and with obsequi majesti approv
my plead reason to the nuptial bower
i led her blush like the morn: all heaven
and happi constel on that hour
shed their selectest influence; the earth
gave sign of gratul and each hill;
joyou the birds; fresh gale and gentl air
whisper it to the wood and from their wing
flung rose flung odour from the spici shrub
disport till the amor bird of night
sung spousal and bid hast the evening-star
on hi hill top to light the bridal lamp
thu have i told thee all my state and brought
my stori to the sum of earthli bliss
which i enjoy; and must confess to find
in all thing els delight inde but such
as use or not work in the mind no chang
nor vehement desire; these delicaci
i mean of tast sight smell herb fruit and flower
walk and the melodi of birds: but here
far otherwis transport i behold
transport touch; here passion first i felt
commot strange! in all enjoy els
superiour and unmoved; here onli weak
against the charm of beauti power glanc
or natur fail in me and left some part
not proof enough such object to sustain;
or from my side subduct took perhap
more than enough; at least on her bestow
too much of ornament in outward show
elabor of inward less exact
for well i understand in the prime end
of natur her the inferiour in the mind
and inward faculti which most excel;
in outward also her resembl less
hi imag who made both and less express
the charact of that dominion given
oer other creatures: yet when i approach
her loveli so absolut she seem
and in herself complet so well to know
her own that what she will to do or say
seem wisest virtuousest discreetest best:
all higher knowledg in her presenc fall
degraded; wisdom in discours with her
lose discountenanc and like folli shows;
author and reason on her wait
as one intend first not after made
occasionally; and to consumm all
great of mind and nobl their seat
build in her loveliest and creat an awe
about her as a guard angelick place
to whom the angel with contract brow
accus not natur she hath done her part;
do thou but thine; and be not diffid
of wisdom; she desert thee not if thou
dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh
by attribut overmuch to thing
less excel as thou thyself perceivest
for what admirest thou what transport thee so
an outside? fair no doubt and worthi well
thi cherish thi honour and thi love;
not thi subjection: weigh with her thyself;
then value: oft-tim noth profit more
than self-esteem ground on just and right
well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest
the more she will acknowledg thee her head
and to realiti yield all her shows:
made so adorn for thi delight the more
so aw that with honour thou mayest love
thi mate who see when thou art seen least wise
but if the sens of touch wherebi mankind
is propag seem such dear delight
beyond all other; think the same vouchsaf
to cattl and each beast; which would not be
to them made common and divulg if aught
therein enjoy were worthi to subdu
the soul of man or passion in him move
what higher in her societi thou findest
attract human ration love still;
in love thou dost well in passion not
wherein true love consist not: love refin
the thought and heart enlarges; hath hi seat
in reason and is judicious; is the scale
by which to heavenli love thou mayest ascend
not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which caus
among the beast no mate for thee wa found
to whom thu half abash adam repli
neither her outsid form so fair nor aught
in procreat common to all kind
(though higher of the genial bed by far
and with mysteri rever i deem)
so much delight me as those grace act
those thousand decenc that daili flow
from all her word and action mix with love
and sweet complianc which declar unfeign
union of mind or in us both one soul;
harmoni to behold in wed pair
more grate than harmoni sound to the ear
yet these subject not; i to thee disclos
what inward thenc i feel not therefor foil
who meet with variou object from the sens
various representing; yet still free
approv the best and follow what i approv
to love thou blamest me not; for love thou sayest
lead up to heaven is both the way and guide;
bear with me then if law what i ask:
love not the heavenli spirit and how their love
express they? by look only? or do they mix
irradi virtual or immedi touch?
to whom the angel with a smile that glow
celesti rosi red love proper hue
answer let it suffic thee that thou knowest
us happi and without love no happi
whatev pure thou in the bodi enjoyest
(and pure thou wert created) we enjoy
in eminence; and obstacl find none
of membran joint or limb exclus bars;
easier than air with air if spirit embrac
total they mix union of pure with pure
desir nor restrain convey need
as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
but i can now no more; the part sun
beyond the earth green cape and verdant isl
hesperian set my signal to depart
be strong live happi and love! but first of all
him whom to love is to obey and keep
hi great command; take heed lest passion sway
thi judgement to do aught which els free will
would not admit: thine and of all thi son
the weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!
i in thi persev shall rejoic
and all the blest: stand fast;to stand or fall
free in thine own arbitr it lie
perfect within no outward aid require;
and all temptat to transgress repel
so say he arose; whom adam thu

gentl to me and affabl hath been

so part they; the angel up to heaven

found unsuspect way there wa a place
now not though sin not time first wrought the chang
where tigri at the foot of paradis
into a gulf shot under ground till part
rose up a fountain by the tree of life:
in with the river sunk and with it rose
satan involv in rise mist; then sought
where to lie hid; sea he had search and land
from eden over pontu and the pool
maeoti up beyond the river ob;
downward as far antarctick; and in length
west from oront to the ocean bar
at darien ; thenc to the land where flow
gang and indus: thu the orb he roam
with narrow search; and with inspect deep
consid everi creatur which of all
most opportun might serv hi wiles; and found
the serpent subtlest beast of all the field
him after long debat irresolut
of thought revolv hi final sentenc chose
fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
to enter and hi dark suggest hide
from sharpest sight: for in the wili snake
whatev sleight none would suspici mark
as from hi wit and nativ subtleti
proceeding; which in other beast observ
doubt might beget of diabolick power
activ within beyond the sens of brute
thu he resolv but first from inward grief
hi burst passion into plaint thu pour
more justli seat worthier of god as built
with second thought reform what wa old!
o earth how like to heaven if not prefer
for what god after better wors would build?
terrestri heaven danc round by other heaven
that shine yet bear their bright offici lamp
light abov light for thee alon as seem
in thee concentr all their preciou beam
of sacr influence! as god in heaven
is center yet extend to all; so thou
centr receivest from all those orbs: in thee
not in themselv all their known virtu appear
product in herb plant and nobler birth
of creatur anim with gradual life
of growth sens reason all sum up in man
with what delight could i have walk thee round
if i could joy in aught sweet interchang
of hill and valley river wood and plain
now land now sea and shore with forest crown
rock den and caves! but i in none of these
find place or refuge; and the more i see
pleasur about me so much more i feel
torment within me as from the hate sieg
of contraries: all good to me becom
bane and in heaven much wors would be my state
but neither here seek i no nor in heaven
to dwell unless by master heaven supreme;
nor hope to be myself less miser
by what i seek but other to make such
as i though therebi wors to me redound:
for onli in destroy i find eas
to my relentless thoughts; and him destroy
or won to what may work hi utter loss
for whom all thi wa made all thi will soon
follow as to him link in weal or woe;
in woe then; that destruct wide may range:
to me shall be the glori sole among
the infern power in one day to have mar
what he almighti style six night and day
continu making; and who know how long
befor had been contriving? though perhap
not longer than sinc i in one night freed
from servitud inglori well nigh half
the angelick name and thinner left the throng
of hi adorers: he to be aveng
and to repair hi number thu impair
whether such virtu spent of old now fail
more angel to creat if they at least
are hi creat or to spite us more
determin to advanc into our room
a creatur form of earth and him endow
exalt from so base origin
with heavenli spoil our spoils: what he decre
he effected; man he made and for him built
magnific thi world and earth hi seat
him lord pronounced; and o indignity!
subject to hi servic angel-w
and flame minist to watch and tend
their earthli charge: of these the vigil
i dread; and to elud thu wrapt in mist
of midnight vapour glide obscur and pri
in everi bush and brake where hap may find
the serpent sleeping; in whose mazi fold
to hide me and the dark intent i bring
o foul descent! that i who erst contend
with god to sit the highest am now constrain
into a beast; and mix with bestial slime
thi essenc to incarn and imbrut
that to the highth of deiti aspired!
but what will not ambit and reveng
descend to? who aspir must down as low
as high he soared; obnoxi first or last
to basest thing reveng at first though sweet
bitter ere long back on itself recoils:
let it; i reck not so it light well aim
sinc higher i fall short on him who next
provok my envi thi new favourit
of heaven thi man of clay son of despit
whom us the more to spite hi maker rais
from dust: spite then with spite is best repaid
so say through each thicket dank or dri
like a black mist low-creep he held on
hi midnight-search where soonest he might find
the serpent; him fast-sleep soon he found
in labyrinth of mani a round self-rol
hi head the midst well store with subtil wiles:
not yet in horrid shade or dismal den
nor nocent yet; but on the grassi herb
fearless unfear he slept: in at hi mouth
the devil entered; and hi brutal sens
in heart or head possess soon inspir
with act intelligential; but hi sleep
disturb not wait close the approach of morn
now when as sacr light began to dawn
in eden on the humid flower that breath
their morn incens when all thing that breath
from the earth great altar send up silent prais
to the creator and hi nostril fill
with grate smell forth came the human pair
and join their vocal worship to the quir
of creatur want voice; that done partak
the season prime for sweetest scent and airs:
then commun how that day they best may pli
their grow work: for much their work out-grew
the hand dispatch of two garden so wide
and eve first to her husband thu began
adam well may we labour still to dress
thi garden still to tend plant herb and flower
our pleasant task enjoined; but till more hand
aid us the work under our labour grow
luxuri by restraint; what we by day
lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind
one night or two with wanton growth derid
tend to wild thou therefor now advis
or bear what to my mind first thought present:
let us divid our labours; thou where choic
lead thee or where most need whether to wind
the woodbin round thi arbour or direct
the clasp ivi where to climb; while i
in yonder spring of rose intermix
with myrtl find what to redress till noon:
for while so near each other thu all day
our task we choos what wonder if so near
look interven and smile or object new
casual discours draw on; which intermit
our day work brought to littl though begun
earli and the hour of supper come unearned?
to whom mild answer adam thu return
sole eve associ sole to me beyond

well hast thou motion well thi thought employ
how we might best fulfil the work which here
god hath assign us; nor of me shalt pass
unpraised: for noth loveli can be found
in woman than to studi houshold good
and good work in her husband to promot
yet not so strictli hath our lord impos
labour as to debar us when we need
refresh whether food or talk between
food of the mind or thi sweet intercours
of look and smiles; for smile from reason flow
to brute deni and are of love the food;
love not the lowest end of human life
for not to irksom toil but to delight
he made us and delight to reason join
these path and bower doubt not but our joint hand
will keep from wilder with eas as wide
as we need walk till younger hand ere long
assist us; but if much convers perhap
thee satiat to short absenc i could yield:
for solitud sometim is best societi
and short retir urg sweet return
but other doubt possess me lest harm
befal thee sever from me; for thou knowest
what hath been warn us what malici foe
envi our happi and of hi own
despair seek to work us woe and shame
by sli assault; and somewher nigh at hand
watch no doubt with greedi hope to find
hi wish and best advantag us asunder;
hopeless to circumv us join where each
to other speedi aid might lend at need:
whether hi first design be to withdraw
our fealti from god or to disturb
conjug love than which perhap no bliss
enjoy by us excit hi envi more;
or thi or wors leav not the faith side
that gave thee be still shade thee and protect
the wife where danger or dishonour lurk
safest and seemliest by her husband stay
who guard her or with her the worst endur
to whom the virgin majesti of eve
as one who love and some unkind meet
with sweet auster composur thu repli
offspr of heaven and earth and all earth lord!
that such an enemi we have who seek
our ruin both by thee inform i learn
and from the part angel over-heard
as in a shadi nook i stood behind
just then return at shut of even flower
but that thou shouldst my firm therefor doubt
to god or thee becaus we have a foe
may tempt it i expect not to hear
hi violenc thou fearest not be such
as we not capabl of death or pain
can either not receiv or can repel
hi fraud is then thi fear; which plain infer
thi equal fear that my firm faith and love
can by hi fraud be shaken or seduced;
thought which how found they harbour in thi breast
adam mis-thought of her to thee so dear?
to whom with heal word adam repli
daughter of god and man immort eve!
for such thou art; from sin and blame entire:
not diffid of thee do i dissuad
thi absenc from my sight but to avoid
the attempt itself intend by our foe
for he who tempt though in vain at least aspers
the tempt with dishonour foul; suppos
not incorrupt of faith not proof
against temptation: thou thyself with scorn
and anger wouldst resent the offer wrong
though ineffectu found: misdeem not then
if such affront i labour to avert
from thee alon which on us both at onc
the enemi though bold will hardli dare;
or dare first on me the assault shall light
nor thou hi malic and fals guil contemn;
subtl he need must be who could seduc
angels; nor think superflu other aid
i from the influenc of thi look receiv
access in everi virtue; in thi sight
more wise more watch stronger if need were
of outward strength; while shame thou look on
shame to be overcom or over-reach
would utmost vigour rais and rais unit
whi shouldst not thou like sens within thee feel
when i am present and thi trial choos
with me best wit of thi virtu tried?
so spake domestick adam in hi care
and matrimoni love; but eve who thought
less attribut to her faith sincer
thu her repli with accent sweet renew
if thi be our condit thu to dwell
in narrow circuit straiten by a foe
subtl or violent we not endu
singl with like defenc wherev met;
how are we happi still in fear of harm?
but harm preced not sin: onli our foe
tempt affront us with hi foul esteem
of our integrity: hi foul esteem
stick no dishonour on our front but turn
foul on himself; then wherefor shun or fear
by us? who rather doubl honour gain
from hi surmis prove false; find peac within
favour from heaven our wit from the event
and what is faith love virtu unassay
alon without exteriour help sustained?
let us not then suspect our happi state
left so imperfect by the maker wise
as not secur to singl or combin
frail is our happi if thi be so
and eden were no eden thu expos
to whom thu adam fervent repli
o woman best are all thing as the will
of god ordain them: hi creat hand
noth imperfect or defici left
of all that he creat much less man
or aught that might hi happi state secur
secur from outward force; within himself
the danger lie yet lie within hi power:
against hi will he can receiv no harm
but god left free the will; for what obey
reason is free; and reason he made right
but bid her well be ware and still erect;
lest by some fair-appear good surpris
she dictat false; and mis-inform the will
to do what god expressli hath forbid
not then mistrust but tender love enjoin
that i should mind thee oft; and mind thou me
firm we subsist yet possibl to swerve;
sinc reason not imposs may meet
some speciou object by the foe suborn
and fall into decept unawar
not keep strictest watch as she wa warn
seek not temptat then which to avoid
were better and most like if from me
thou sever not: trial will come unsought
wouldst thou approv thi constanc approv
first thi obedience; the other who can know
not see thee attempt who attest?
but if thou think trial unsought may find
us both secur than thu warn thou seemest
go; for thi stay not free absent thee more;
go in thi nativ innoc reli
on what thou hast of virtue; summon all!
for god toward thee hath done hi part do thine
so spake the patriarch of mankind; but eve
persisted; yet submiss though last repli
with thi permiss then and thu forewarn
chiefli by what thi own last reason word
touch only; that our trial when least sought
may find us both perhap far less prepar
the willing i go nor much expect
a foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
so bent the more shall shame him hi repuls
thu say from her husband hand her hand
soft she withdrew; and like a wood-nymph light
oread or dryad or of delia train
betook her to the groves; but delia self
in gait surpass and goddess-lik deport
though not as she with bow and quiver arm
but with such garden tool as art yet rude
guiltless of fire had form or angel brought
to pale or pomona thu adorn
likest she seem pomona when she fled
vertumnu or to cere in her prime
yet virgin of proserpina from jove
her long with ardent look hi eye pursu
delight but desir more her stay
oft he to her hi charg of quick return
repeated; she to him as oft engag
to be return by noon amid the bower
and all thing in best order to invit
noontid repast or afternoon repos
o much deceiv much fail hapless eve
of thi presum return! event perverse!
thou never from that hour in paradis
foundst either sweet repast or sound repose;
such ambush hid among sweet flower and shade
wait with hellish rancour immin
to intercept thi way or send thee back
despoil of innoc of faith of bliss!
for now and sinc first break of dawn the fiend
mere serpent in appear forth wa come;
and on hi quest where likeliest he might find
the onli two of mankind but in them
the whole includ race hi purpos prey
in bower and field he sought where ani tuft
of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay
their tendanc or plantat for delight;
by fountain or by shadi rivulet
he sought them both but wish hi hap might find
eve separate; he wish but not with hope
of what so seldom chanced; when to hi wish
beyond hi hope eve separ he spi
veil in a cloud of fragranc where she stood
half spi so thick the rose blush round
about her glow oft stoop to support
each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
carnat purpl azur or speck with gold
hung droop unsustained; them she upstay
gentli with myrtl band mindless the while

from her best prop so far and storm so nigh
nearer he drew and mani a walk travers
of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm;
then volubl and bold now hid now seen
among thick-woven arboret and flower
imbord on each bank the hand of eve:
spot more delici than those garden feign
or of reviv adoni or renown
alcin host of old laert son;
or that not mystick where the sapient king
held dallianc with hi fair egyptian spous
much he the place admir the person more
as one who long in popul citi pent
where hous thick and sewer annoy the air
forth issu on a summer morn to breath
among the pleasant villag and farm

the smell of grain or ted grass or kine
or dairi each rural sight each rural sound;
if chanc with nymph-lik step fair virgin pass
what pleas seem for her now pleas more;
she most and in her look sum all delight:
such pleasur took the serpent to behold
thi floweri plat the sweet recess of eve
thu earli thu alone: her heavenli form
angelick but more soft and feminin
her grace innoc her everi air
of gestur or least action overaw
hi malic and with rapin sweet bereav
hi fierc of the fierc intent it brought:
that space the evil-on abstract stood
from hi own evil and for the time remain
stupidli good; of enmiti disarm
of guil of hate of envi of revenge:
but the hot hell that alway in him burn
though in mid heaven soon end hi delight
and tortur him now more the more he see
of pleasur not for him ordained: then soon
fierc hate he recollect and all hi thought
of mischief gratul thu excit
thought whither have ye led me! with what sweet
compuls thu transport to forget
what hither brought us! hate not love;nor hope
of paradis for hell hope here to tast
of pleasure; but all pleasur to destroy
save what is in destroying; other joy
to me is lost then let me not let pass
occas which now smiles; behold alon
the woman opportun to all attempt
her husband for i view far round not nigh
whose higher intellectu more i shun
and strength of courag haughti and of limb
heroick built though of terrestri mould;
foe not informidable! exempt from wound
i not; so much hath hell debas and pain
enfeebl me to what i wa in heaven
she fair divin fair fit love for gods!
not terribl though terrour be in love
and beauti not approach by stronger hate
hate stronger under show of love well feigned;
the way which to her ruin now i tend
so spake the enemi of mankind enclos
in serpent inmat bad! and toward eve
address hi way: not with indent wave
prone on the ground as since; but on hi rear
circular base of rise fold that tower
fold abov fold a surg maze! hi head
crest aloft and carbuncl hi eyes;
with burnish neck of verdant gold erect
amidst hi circl spire that on the grass
float redundant: pleas wa hi shape
and lovely; never sinc of serpent-kind
loveli not those that in illyria chang
hermion and cadmu or the god

ammonian jove or capitolin wa seen;
he with olympias; thi with her who bore
scipio the highth of rome with tract obliqu
at first as one who sought access but fear
to interrupt side-long he work hi way
as when a ship by skil steersmen wrought
nigh river mouth or foreland where the wind
veer oft as oft so steer and shift her sail:
so vari he and of hi tortuou train
curl mani a wanton wreath in sight of eve
to lure her eye; she busi heard the sound
of rusl leav but mind not as use
to such disport befor her through the field
from everi beast; more duteou at her call
than at circean call the herd disguis
he bolder now uncal befor her stood
but as in gaze admiring: oft he bow
hi turret crest and sleek enamel neck
fawning; and lick the ground whereon she trod
hi gentl dumb express turn at length
the eye of eve to mark hi play; he glad
of her attent gain with serpent-tongu
organick or impuls of vocal air
hi fraudul temptat thu began
wonder not sovran mistress if perhap
thou canst who art sole wonder! much less arm
thi look the heaven of mild with disdain
displeas that i approach thee thu and gaze
insatiate; i thu single;nor have fear
thi aw brow more aw thu retir
fairest resembl of thi maker fair
thee all thing live gaze on all thing thine
by gift and thi celesti beauti ador
with ravish beheld! there best beheld
where univers admired; but here
in thi enclosur wild these beast among
behold rude and shallow to discern
half what in thee is fair one man except
who see thee? and what is one? who should be seen
a goddess among god ador and serv
by angel numberless thi daili train
so gloze the tempter and hi proem tuned:
into the heart of eve hi word made way
though at the voic much marvelling; at length
not unamaz she thu in answer spake
what may thi mean? languag of man pronounc
by tongu of brute and human sens expressed?
the first at least of these i thought deni
to beasts; whom god on their creation-day
creat mute to all articul sound:
the latter i demur; for in their look
much reason and in their action oft appear
thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field
i knew but not with human voic endued;
redoubl then thi miracl and say
how camest thou speakabl of mute and how
to me so friendli grown abov the rest
of brutal kind that daili are in sight?
say for such wonder claim attent due
to whom the guil tempter thu repli
empress of thi fair world resplend eve!
easi to me it is to tell thee all
what thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:
i wa at first as other beast that graze
the trodden herb of abject thought and low
as wa my food; nor aught but food discern
or sex and apprehend noth high:
till on a day rove the field i chanc
a goodli tree far distant to behold
loaden with fruit of fairest colour mix
ruddi and gold: i nearer drew to gaze;
when from the bough a savouri odour blown
grate to appetit more pleas my sens
than smell of sweetest fennel or the teat
of ewe or goat drop with milk at even
unsuck of lamb or kid that tend their play
to satisfi the sharp desir i had
of tast those fair appl i resolv
not to defer; hunger and thirst at onc
power persuad quicken at the scent
of that allur fruit urg me so keen
about the mossi trunk i wound me soon;
for high from ground the branch would requir
thi utmost reach or adams: round the tree
all other beast that saw with like desir
long and envi stood but could not reach
amid the tree now got where plenti hung
tempt so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
i spare not; for such pleasur till that hour
at feed or fountain never had i found
sate at length ere long i might perceiv
strang alter in me to degre
of reason in my inward powers; and speech
want not long; though to thi shape retain
thenceforth to specul high or deep
i turn my thought and with capaci mind
consid all thing visibl in heaven
or earth or middle; all thing fair and good:
but all that fair and good in thi divin
semblanc and in thi beauti heavenli ray
unit i beheld; no fair to thine
equival or second! which compel
me thu though importun perhap to come
and gaze and worship thee of right declar
sovran of creatur univers dame!
so talk the spirit sli snake; and eve
yet more amaz unwari thu repli
serpent thi overprais leav in doubt
the virtu of that fruit in thee first proved:
but say where grow the tree? from henc how far?
for mani are the tree of god that grow
in paradis and variou yet unknown
to us; in such abund lie our choic
as leav a greater store of fruit untouch
still hang incorrupt till men
grow up to their provis and more hand
help to disburden natur of her birth
to whom the wili adder blith and glad
empress the way is readi and not long;
beyond a row of myrtl on a flat
fast by a fountain one small thicket past
of blow myrrh and balm: if thou accept
my conduct i can bring thee thither soon
lead then said eve he lead swiftli roll
in tangl and made intric seem straight
to mischief swift hope elev and joy
brighten hi crest; as when a wander fire
compact of unctuou vapour which the night
condens and the cold environ round
kindl through agit to a flame
which oft they say some evil spirit attend
hover and blaze with delus light
mislead the amaz night-wander from hi way
to bog and mire and oft through pond or pool;
there swallow up and lost from succour far
so glister the dire snake and into fraud
led eve our credul mother to the tree
of prohibit root of all our woe;
which when she saw thu to her guid she spake
serpent we might have spare our come hither
fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
the credit of whose virtu rest with thee;
wonder inde if caus of such effect
but of thi tree we may not tast nor touch;
god so command and left that command
sole daughter of hi voice; the rest we live
law to ourselves; our reason is our law
to whom the tempter guil repli
indeed! hath god then said that of the fruit
of all these garden-tre ye shall not eat
yet lord declar of all in earth or air$?
to whom thu eve yet sinless of the fruit
of each tree in the garden we may eat;
but of the fruit of thi fair tree amidst
the garden god hath said ye shall not eat
thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
she scarc had said though brief when now more bold
the tempter but with show of zeal and love
to man and indign at hi wrong
new part put on; and as to passion move
fluctuat disturb yet come and in act
rais as of some great matter to begin
as when of old some orat renown
in athen or free rome where eloqu
flourish sinc mute! to some great caus address
stood in himself collected; while each part
motion each act won audienc ere the tongue;
sometim in highth began as no delay
of prefac brook through hi zeal of right:
so stand move or to highth up grown
the tempter all impass thu began
o sacr wise and wisdom-giv plant
mother of science! now i feel thi power
within me clear; not onli to discern
thing in their caus but to trace the way
of highest agent deem howev wise
queen of thi universe! do not believ
those rigid threat of death: ye shall not die:
how should you? by the fruit? it give you life
to knowledge; by the threatener? look on me
me who have touch and tasted; yet both live
and life more perfect have attain than fate
meant me by ventur higher than my lot
shall that be shut to man which to the beast
is open? or will god incens hi ire
for such a petti trespass? and not prais
rather your dauntless virtu whom the pain
of death denounc whatev thing death be
deter not from achiev what might lead
to happier life knowledg of good and evil;
of good how just? of evil if what is evil
be real whi not known sinc easier shunned?
god therefor cannot hurt ye and be just;
not just not god; not fear then nor obeyed:
your fear itself of death remov the fear
whi then wa thi forbid? whi but to awe;
whi but to keep ye low and ignor
hi worshippers? he know that in the day
ye eat thereof your eye that seem so clear
yet are but dim shall perfectli be then
open and clear and ye shall be as god
know both good and evil as they know
that ye shall be as god sinc i as man
intern man is but proport meet;
i of brute human; ye of human god
so ye shall die perhap by put off
human to put on gods; death to be wish
though threaten which no wors than thi can bring
and what are god that man may not becom
as they particip god-lik food?
the god are first and that advantag use
on our belief that all from them proceeds:
i question it; for thi fair earth i see
warm by the sun produc everi kind;
them nothing: if they all thing who enclos
knowledg of good and evil in thi tree
that whoso eat thereof forthwith attain
wisdom without their leave? and wherein lie
the offenc that man should thu attain to know?
what can your knowledg hurt him or thi tree
impart against hi will if all be his?
or is it envy? and can envi dwell
in heavenli breasts? these these and mani more
caus import your need of thi fair fruit
goddess human reach then and freeli taste!
he ended; and hi word replet with guil
into her heart too easi entranc won:
fix on the fruit she gaze which to behold
might tempt alone; and in her ear the sound
yet rung of hi persuas word impregn
with reason to her seem and with truth:
mean while the hour of noon drew on and wake
an eager appetit rais by the smell
so savouri of that fruit which with desir
inclin now grown to touch or tast
solicit her long eye; yet first
paus a while thu to herself she muse
great are thi virtu doubtless best of fruit
though kept from man and worthi to be admired;
whose tast too long forborn at first assay
gave elocut to the mute and taught
the tongu not made for speech to speak thi praise:
thi prais he also who forbid thi use
conceal not from us name thee the tree
of knowledg knowledg both of good and evil;
forbid us then to taste! but hi forbid
commend thee more while it infer the good
by thee commun and our want:
for good unknown sure is not had; or had
and yet unknown is as not had at all
in plain then what forbid he but to know
forbid us good forbid us to be wise?
such prohibit bind not but if death
bind us with after-band what profit then
our inward freedom? in the day we eat
of thi fair fruit our doom is we shall die!
how die the serpent? he hath eaten and live
and know and speak and reason and discern
irrat till then for us alon
wa death invented? or to us deni
thi intellectu food for beast reserved?
for beast it seems: yet that one beast which first
hath tast envi not but bring with joy
the good befallen him author unsuspect
friendli to man far from deceit or guil
what fear i then? rather what know to fear
under thi ignor of good and evil
of god or death of law or penalty?
here grow the cure of all thi fruit divin
fair to the eye invit to the tast
of virtu to make wise: what hinder then
to reach and feed at onc both bodi and mind?
so say her rash hand in evil hour
forth reach to the fruit she pluck she eat!
earth felt the wound; and natur from her seat
sigh through all her work gave sign of woe
that all wa lost back to the thicket slunk
the guilti serpent; and well might;for eve
intent now wholli on her tast nought els
regarded; such delight till then as seem
in fruit she never tast whether true
or fanci so through expect high
of knowledge; not wa godhead from her thought
greedili she ingorg without restraint
and knew not eat death: satiat at length
and highten as with wine jocund and boon
thu to herself she pleasingli began
o sovran virtuou preciou of all tree
in paradise! of oper blest
to sapienc hitherto obscur infam
and thi fair fruit let hang as to no end
created; but henceforth my earli care
not without song each morn and due prais
shall tend thee and the fertil burden eas
of thi full branch offer free to all;
till diet by thee i grow matur
in knowledg as the god who all thing know;
though other envi what they cannot give:
for had the gift been their it had not here
thu grown experi next to thee i owe
best guide; not follow thee i had remain
in ignorance; thou openest wisdom way
and givest access though secret she retir
and i perhap am secret: heaven is high
high and remot to see from thenc distinct
each thing on earth; and other care perhap
may have divert from continu watch
our great forbidd safe with all hi spi
about him but to adam in what sort
shall i appear? shall i to him make known
as yet my chang and give him to partak
full happi with me or rather not
but keep the odd of knowledg in my power
without copartner? so to add what want
in femal sex the more to draw hi love
and render me more equal; and perhap
a thing not undesir sometim
superiour; for inferiour who is free
thi may be well: but what if god have seen
and death ensue? then i shall be no more!
and adam wed to anoth eve
shall live with her enjoy i extinct;
a death to think! confirm then i resolv
adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
so dear i love him that with him all death
i could endur without him live no life
so say from the tree her step she turned;
but first low rever done as to the power
that dwelt within whose presenc had infus
into the plant sciential sap deriv
from nectar drink of god adam the while
wait desir her return had wove
of choicest flower a garland to adorn
her tress and her rural labour crown;
as reaper oft are wont their harvest-queen
great joy he promis to hi thought and new
solac in her return so long delayed:
yet oft hi heart divin of someth ill
misgav him; he the falter measur felt;
and forth to meet her went the way she took
that morn when first they parted: by the tree
of knowledg he must pass; there he her met
scarc from the tree returning; in her hand
a bough of fairest fruit that downi smile
new gather and ambrosi smell diffus
to him she hasted; in her face excus
came prologu and apolog too prompt;
which with bland word at will she thu address
hast thou not wonder adam at my stay?
thee i have miss and thought it long depriv
thi presence; agoni of love till now
not felt nor shall be twice; for never more
mean i to tri what rash untri i sought
the pain of absenc from thi sight but strang
hath been the caus and wonder to hear:
thi tree is not as we are told a tree
of danger tast nor to evil unknown
open the way but of divin effect
to open eye and make them god who taste;
and hath been tast such: the serpent wise
or not restrain as we or not obey
hath eaten of the fruit; and is becom
not dead as we are threaten but thenceforth
endu with human voic and human sens
reason to admiration; and with me
persuas hath so prevail that i
have also tast and have also found
the effect to correspond; open mine eye
dim erst dilat spirit ampler heart
and grow up to godhead; which for thee
chiefli i sought without thee can despis
for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss;
tediou unshar with thee and odiou soon
thou therefor also tast that equal lot
may join us equal joy as equal love;
lest thou not tast differ degre
disjoin us and i then too late renounc
deiti for thee when fate will not permit
thu eve with counten blith her stori told;
but in her cheek distemp flush glow
on the other side adam soon as he heard
the fatal trespass done by eve amaz
astoni stood and blank while horrour chill
ran through hi vein and all hi joint relaxed;
from hi slack hand the garland wreath for eve
down dropt and all the fade rose shed:
speechless he stood and pale till thu at length
first to himself he inward silenc broke
o fairest of creation last and best
of all god work creatur in whom excel
whatev can to sight or thought be form
holi divin good amiabl or sweet!
how art thou lost! how on a sudden lost
defac deflow and now to death devote!
rather how hast thou yield to transgress
the strict forbidd how to violat
the sacr fruit forbidden! some curs fraud
of enemi hath beguil thee yet unknown
and me with thee hath ruined; for with thee
certain my resolut is to die:
how can i live without thee! how forego
thi sweet convers and love so dearli join
to live again in these wild wood forlorn!
should god creat anoth eve and i
anoth rib afford yet loss of thee
would never from my heart: no no!i feel
the link of natur draw me: flesh of flesh
bone of my bone thou art and from thi state
mine never shall be part bliss or woe
so have said as one from sad dismay
recomfort and after thought disturb
submit to what seem remediless
thu in calm mood hi word to eve he turn
bold deed thou hast presum adventur eve
and peril great provok who thu hast dare
had it been onli covet to eye
that sacr fruit sacr to abstin
much more to tast it under ban to touch
but past who can recal or done undo?
not god omnipot nor fate; yet so
perhap thou shalt not die perhap the fact
is not so heinou now foretast fruit
profan first by the serpent by him first
made common and unhallow ere our taste;
nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;
live as thou saidst and gain to live as man
higher degre of life; induc strong
to us as like tast to attain
proport ascent; which cannot be
but to be god or angel demi-god
nor can i think that god creator wise
though threaten will in earnest so destroy
us hi prime creatur dignifi so high
set over all hi works; which in our fall
for us creat need with us must fail
depend made; so god shall uncreat
be frustrat do undo and labour lose;
not well conceiv of god who though hi power
creation could repeat yet would be loth
us to abolish lest the adversari
triumph and say; fickl their state whom god
most favours; who can pleas him long? me first
he ruin now mankind; whom will he next?
matter of scorn not to be given the foe
howev i with thee have fix my lot
certain to undergo like doom: if death
consort with thee death is to me as life;
so forcibl within my heart i feel
the bond of natur draw me to my own;
my own in thee for what thou art is mine;
our state cannot be severed; we are one
one flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself
so adam; and thu eve to him repli
o gloriou trial of exceed love
illustri evid exampl high!
engag me to emulate; but short
of thi perfect how shall i attain
adam from whose dear side i boast me sprung
and gladli of our union hear thee speak
one heart one soul in both; whereof good proof
thi day afford declar thee resolv
rather than death or aught than death more dread
shall separ us link in love so dear
to undergo with me one guilt one crime
if ani be of tast thi fair fruit;
whose virtu for of good still good proce
direct or by occas hath present
thi happi trial of thi love which els
so emin never had been known?
were it i thought death menac would ensu
thi my attempt i would sustain alon
the worst and not persuad thee rather die
desert than oblig thee with a fact
pernici to thi peace; chiefli assur
remark so late of thi so true
so faith love unequalled: but i feel
far otherwis the event; not death but life
augment open eye new hope new joy
tast so divin that what of sweet befor
hath touch my sens flat seem to thi and harsh
on my experi adam freeli tast
and fear of death deliv to the wind
so say she embrac him and for joy
tenderli wept; much won that he hi love
had so ennobl as of choic to incur
divin displeasur for her sake or death
in recomp for such complianc bad
such recomp best merit from the bough
she gave him of that fair entic fruit
with liber hand: he scrupl not to eat
against hi better knowledge; not deceiv
but fondli overcom with femal charm
earth trembl from her entrail as again
in pangs; and natur gave a second groan;
sky loured; and mutter thunder some sad drop
wept at complet of the mortal sin
original: while adam took no thought
eat hi fill; nor eve to iter
her former trespass fear the more to sooth
him with her love society; that now
as with new wine intox both
they swim in mirth and fanci that they feel
divin within them breed wing
wherewith to scorn the earth: but that fals fruit
far other oper first display
carnal desir inflaming; he on eve
began to cast lascivi eyes; she him
as wantonli repaid; in lust they burn:
till adam thu gan eve to dallianc move
eve now i see thou art exact of tast
and eleg of sapienc no small part;
sinc to each mean savour we appli
and palat call judicious; i the prais
yield thee so well thi day thou hast purvey
much pleasur we have lost while we abstain
from thi delight fruit nor known till now
true relish tasting; if such pleasur be
in thing to us forbidden it might be wish
for thi one tree had been forbidden ten
but come so well refresh now let us play
as meet is after such delici fare;
for never did thi beauti sinc the day
i saw thee first and wed thee adorn
with all perfect so inflam my sens
with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
than ever; bounti of thi virtuou tree!
so said he and forbor not glanc or toy
of amor intent; well understood
of eve whose eye dart contagi fire
her hand he seised; and to a shadi bank
thick over-head with verdant roof imbow
he led her noth loth; flower were the couch
pansi and violet and asphodel
and hyacinth; earth freshest softest lap
there they their fill of love and love disport
took larg of their mutual guilt the seal
the solac of their sin; till dewi sleep
oppress them weari with their amor play
soon as the forc of that fallaci fruit
that with exhilar vapour bland
about their spirit had play and inmost power
made err wa now exhaled; and grosser sleep
bred of unkindli fume with consciou dream
incumb now had left them; up they rose
as from unrest; and each the other view
soon found their eye how open and their mind
how darkened; innoc that as a veil
had shadow them from know ill wa gone;
just confid and nativ righteous
and honour from about them nake left
to guilti shame; he cover but hi robe
uncov more so rose the danit strong
herculean samson from the harlot-lap
of philistean dalilah and wake
shorn of hi strength they destitut and bare
of all their virtue: silent and in face
confound long they sat as strucken mute:
till adam though not less than eve abash
at length gave utter to these word constrain
o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
to that fals worm of whomsoev taught
to counterfeit man voice; true in our fall
fals in our promis rising; sinc our eye
open we find inde and find we know
both good and evil; good lost and evil got;
bad fruit of knowledg if thi be to know;
which leav us nake thu of honour void
of innoc of faith of puriti
our wont ornament now soil and stain
and in our face evid the sign
of foul concupiscence; whenc evil store;
even shame the last of evils; of the first
be sure then--how shall i behold the face
henceforth of god or angel erst with joy
and raptur so oft beheld? those heavenli shape
will dazzl now thi earthli with their blaze
insuffer bright o! might i here
in solitud live savage; in some glade
obscur where highest wood impenetr
to star or sun-light spread their umbrag broad
and brown as evening: cover me ye pines!
ye cedar with innumer bough
hide me where i may never see them more!--
but let us now as in bad plight devis
what best may for the present serv to hide
the part of each from other that seem most
to shame obnoxi and unseemliest seen;
some tree whose broad smooth leav togeth sew
and gird on our loin may cover round
those middl parts; that thi new comer shame
there sit not and reproach us as unclean
so counsel he and both togeth went
into the thickest wood; there soon they chose
the fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renown
but such as at thi day to indian known
in malabar or decan spread her arm
branch so broad and long that in the ground
the bend twig take root and daughter grow
about the mother tree a pillar shade
high over-arch and echo walk between:
there oft the indian herdsman shun heat
shelter in cool and tend hi pastur herd
at loop-hol cut through thickest shade: those leav
they gather broad as amazonian targe;
and with what skill they had togeth sew
to gird their waist; vain cover if to hide
their guilt and dread shame! o how unlik
to that first nake glory! such of late
columbu found the american so girt
with feather cincture; nake els and wild
among the tree on isl and woodi shore
thu fenc and as they thought their shame in part
cover but not at rest or eas of mind
they sat them down to weep; nor onli tear
rain at their eye but high wind wors within
began to rise high passion anger hate
mistrust suspicion discord; and shook sore
their inward state of mind calm region onc
and full of peac now tost and turbulent:
for understand rule not and the will
heard not her lore; both in subject now
to sensual appetit who from beneath
usurp over sovran reason claim
superiour sway: from thu distemp breast
adam estrang in look and alter style
speech intermit thu to eve renew
would thou hadst hearken to my word and staid
with me as i besought thee when that strang
desir of wander thi unhappi morn

let none henceforth seek needless caus to approv

to whom soon move with touch of blame thu eve

imputest thou that to my default or will
of wander as thou callest it which who know
but might as ill have happen thou be by

wa i to have never part from thi side?
as good have grown there still a lifeless rib

command me absolut not to go

mean while the heinou and despit act
of satan done in paradise; and how
he in the serpent had pervert eve
her husband she to tast the fatal fruit
wa known in heaven; for what can scape the eye
of god all-se or deceiv hi heart
omniscient? who in all thing wise and just
hinder not satan to attempt the mind
of man with strength entir and free will arm
complet to have discov and repuls
whatev wile of foe or seem friend
for still they knew and ought to have still rememb
the high injunct not to tast that fruit
whoever tempted; which they not obey
(incur what could they less?) the penalty;
and manifold in sin deserv to fall
up into heaven from paradis in hast
the angelick guard ascend mute and sad
for man; for of hi state by thi they knew
much wonder how the subtl fiend had stolen
entranc unseen soon as the unwelcom news
from earth arriv at heaven-g displeas
all were who heard; dim sad did not spare
that time celesti visag yet mix
with piti violat not their bliss
about the new-arriv in multitud
the ether peopl ran to hear and know
how all befel: they toward the throne suprem
account made hast to make appear
with righteou plea their utmost vigil
and easili approved; when the most high
etern father from hi secret cloud
amidst in thunder utter thu hi voic
assembl angel and ye power return
from unsuccess charge; be not dismay
nor troubl at these tide from the earth
which your sincerest care could not prevent;
foretold so late what would come to pass
when first thi tempter cross the gulf from hell
i told ye then he should prevail and speed
on hi bad errand; man should be seduc
and flatter out of all believ lie
against hi maker; no decre of mine
concur to necessit hi fall
or touch with lightest moment of impuls
hi free will to her own inclin left
in even scale but fallen he is; and now
what rest but that the mortal sentenc pass
on hi transgression--death denounc that day?
which he presum alreadi vain and void
becaus not yet inflict as he fear
by some immedi stroke; but soon shall find
forbear no acquitt ere day end
justic shall not return as bounti scorn
but whom send i to judg them? whom but thee
viceger son? to thee i have transfer
all judgement whether in heaven or earth or hell
easi it may be seen that i intend
merci colleagu with justic send thee
man friend hi mediat hi design
both ransom and redeem voluntari
and destin man himself to judg man fallen
so spake the father; and unfold bright
toward the right hand hi glori on the son
blaze forth uncloud deity: he full
resplend all hi father manifest
express and thu divin answer mild
father etern thine is to decree;
mine both in heaven and earth to do thi will
supreme; that thou in me thi son belov
mayest ever rest well pleas i go to judg
on earth these thi transgressours; but thou knowest
whoever judg the worst on me must light
when time shall be; for so i undertook
befor thee; and not repent thi obtain
of right that i may mitig their doom
on me derived; yet i shall temper so
justic with merci as may illustr most
them fulli satisfi and thee appeas
attend none shall need nor train where none
are to behold the judgement but the judg
those two; the third best absent is condemn
convict by flight and rebel to all law:
convict to the serpent none belong
thu say from hi radiant seat he rose
of high collater glory: him throne and power
princedom and domin ministr
accompani to heaven-gate; from whenc
eden and all the coast in prospect lay
down he descend straight; the speed of god
time count not though with swiftest minut wing
now wa the sun in western cadenc low
from noon and gentl air due at their hour
to fan the earth now wake and usher in
the even cool; when he from wrath more cool
came the mild judg and intercessour both
to sentenc man: the voic of god they heard
now walk in the garden by soft wind
brought to their ear while day declined; they heard
and from hi presenc hid themselv among
the thickest tree both man and wife; till god
approach thu to adam call aloud
where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
my come seen far off? i miss thee here
not pleas thu entertain with solitud
where obviou duti ere while appear unsought:
or come i less conspicu or what chang
absent thee or what chanc detains?--com forth!
he came; and with him eve more loth though first
to offend; discountenanc both and discomposed;
love wa not in their look either to god
or to each other; but appar guilt
and shame and perturb and despair
anger and obstinaci and hate and guil
whenc adam falter long thu answer brief
i heard thee in the garden and of thi voic
afraid be nake hid myself to whom
the graciou judg without revil repli
my voic thou oft hast heard and hast not fear
but still rejoiced; how is it now becom
so dread to thee? that thou art nake who
hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the tree
whereof i gave thee charg thou shouldst not eat?
to whom thu adam sore beset repli
o heaven! in evil strait thi day i stand
befor my judge; either to undergo
myself the total crime or to accus
my other self the partner of my life;
whose fail while her faith to me remain
i should conceal and not expos to blame
by my complaint: but strict necess
subdu me and calamit constraint;
lest on my head both sin and punish
howev insupport be all
devolved; though should i hold my peac yet thou
wouldst easili detect what i conceal--
thi woman whom thou madest to be my help
and gavest me as thi perfect gift so good
so fit so accept so divin
that from her hand i could suspect no ill
and what she did whatev in itself
her do seem to justifi the deed;
she gave me of the tree and i did eat
to whom the sovran presenc thu repli
wa she thi god that her thou didst obey
befor hi voice? or wa she made thi guid
superiour or but equal that to her
thou didst resign thi manhood and the place
wherein god set thee abov her made of thee
and for thee whose perfect far excel
her in all real dignity? adorn
she wa inde and love to attract
thi love not thi subjection; and her gift
were such as under govern well seemed;
unseemli to bear rule; which wa thi part
and person hadst thou known thyself aright
so have said he thu to eve in few
say woman what is thi which thou hast done?
to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm
confess soon yet not befor her judg
bold or loquaci thu abash repli
the serpent me beguil and i did eat
which when the lord god heard without delay
to judgement he proceed on the accus
serpent though brute; unabl to transfer
the guilt on him who made him instrument
of mischief and pollut from the end
of hi creation; justli then accurs
as vitiat in nature: more to know
concern not man (sinc he no further knew)
nor alter hi offence; yet god at last
to satan first in sin hi doom appli
though in mysteri term judg as then best:
and on the serpent thu hi curs let fall
becaus thou hast done thi thou art accurs
abov all cattl each beast of the field;
upon thi belli grovel thou shalt go
and dust shalt eat all the day of thi life
between thee and the woman i will put
enmiti and between thine and her seed;
her seed shall bruis thi head thou bruis hi heel
so spake thi oracl then verifi
when jesu son of mari second eve
saw satan fall like lightn down from heaven
princ of the air; then rise from hi grave
spoil princip and power triumph
in open show; and with ascens bright
captiv led captiv through the air
the realm itself of satan long usurped;
whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
even he who now foretold hi fatal bruise;
and to the woman thu hi sentenc turn
thi sorrow i will greatli multipli
by thi conception; children thou shalt bring
in sorrow forth; and to thi husband will
thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule
on adam last thu judgement he pronounc
becaus thou hast hearken to the voic of thi wife
and eaten of the tree concern which
i charg thee say thou shalt not eat thereof:
curs is the ground for thi sake; thou in sorrow
shalt eat thereof all the day of thi life;
thorn also and thistl it shall bring thee forth
unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
in the sweat of thi face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground; for thou
out of the ground wast taken know thi birth
for dust thou art and shalt to dust return
so judg he man both judg and saviour sent;
and the instant stroke of death denounc that day
remov far off; then piti how they stood
befor him nake to the air that now
must suffer chang disdain not to begin
thenceforth the form of servant to assume;
as when he wash hi servant feet; so now
as father of hi famili he clad
their naked with skin of beast or slain
or as the snake with youth coat repaid;
and thought not much to cloth hi enemies;
nor he their outward onli with the skin
of beast but inward naked much more
opprobri with hi robe of righteous

in glori as of old; to him appeas

o son whi sit we here each other view
idli while satan our great author thrive

so say with delight he snuf the smell

so scent the grim featur and upturn
hi nostril wide into the murki air;
sagaci of hi quarri from so far
then both from out hell-gat into the wast
wide anarchi of chao damp and dark
flew diverse; and with power (their power wa great)
hover upon the water what they met
solid or slimi as in rage sea
tost up and down togeth croud drove

from out of chao to the outsid bare
of thi round world: with pin of adam
and chain they made all fast too fast they made

and of thi world; and on the left hand hell
with long reach interposed; three sever way
in sight to each of these three place led
and now their way to earth they had descri

satan in like of an angel bright
betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steer
hi zenith while the sun in ari rose:
disguis he came; but those hi children dear
their parent soon discern though in disguis
he after eve seduc unmind slunk

to observ the sequel saw hi guil act
by eve though all unweet second
upon her husband; saw their shame that sought
vain covertures; but when he saw descend
the son of god to judg them terrifi
he fled; not hope to escap but shun
the present; fear guilti what hi wrath
might suddenli inflict; that past return
by night and listen where the hapless pair
sat in their sad discours and variou plaint
thenc gather hi own doom; which understood
not instant but of futur time with joy
and tide fraught to hell he now returned;
and at the brink of chao near the foot

triumphal with triumphal act have met

no detriment need fear; go and be strong!
so say he dismiss them; they with speed
their cours through thickest constel held
spread their bane; the blast star look wan
and planet planet-struck real eclips
then suffer the other way satan went down
the causey to hell-gate: on either side
dispart chao overbuilt exclaim
and with rebound surg the bar assail
that scorn hi indignation: through the gate
wide open and unguard satan pass
and all about found desolate; for those
appoint to sit there had left their charg
flown to the upper world; the rest were all
far to the inland retir about the wall
of pandemonium; citi and proud seat
of lucif so by allus call
of that bright star to satan paragoned;
there kept their watch the legion while the grand

might intercept their emperour sent; so he
depart gave command and they observ
as when the tartar from hi russian foe

heaven-banish host left desart utmost hell
mani a dark leagu reduc in care watch

each hour their great adventur from the search
of foreign worlds: he through the midst unmark

of lowest order passed; and from the door
of that plutonian hall invis
ascend hi high throne; which under state
of richest textur spread at the upper end
wa place in regal lustr down a while

at last as from a cloud hi fulgent head
and shape star-bright appear or brighter; clad
with what permiss glori sinc hi fall

at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng
bent their aspect and whom they wish beheld
their mighti chief returned: loud wa the acclaim:

for in possess such not onli of right

littl inferiour by my adventur hard

voyag th unreal vast unbound deep
of horribl confusion; over which
by sin and death a broad way now is pave
to expedit your gloriou march; but i
toil out my uncouth passag forc to ride
the untract abyss plung in the womb
of unorigin night and chao wild;
that jealou of their secret fierc oppos
my journey strang with clamor uproar
protest fate supreme; thenc how i found
the new creat world which fame in heaven
long had foretold a fabrick wonder
of absolut perfection! therein man
place in a paradis by our exil
made happy: him by fraud i have seduc
from hi creator; and the more to encreas
your wonder with an apple; he thereat
offend worth your laughter! hath given up
both hi belov man and all hi world
to sin and death a prey and so to us
without our hazard labour or alarm;
to rang in and to dwell and over man
to rule as over all he should have rule
true is me also he hath judg or rather
me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
man i deceived: that which to me belong
is enmiti which he will put between
me and mankind; i am to bruis hi heel;
hi seed when is not set shall bruis my head:
a world who would not purchas with a bruis
or much more grievou pain?--y have the account
of my performance: what remain ye god
but up and enter now into full bliss?
so have said a while he stood expect
their univers shout and high applaus
to fill hi ear; when contrari he hear
on all side from innumer tongu
a dismal univers hiss the sound
of publick scorn; he wonder but not long
had leisur wonder at himself now more
hi visag drawn he felt to sharp and spare;

where all yet left of that revolt rout
heaven-fallen in station stood or just array;
sublim with expect when to see
in triumph issu forth their gloriou chief;
they saw but other sight instead! a croud
of ugli serpents; horrour on them fell
and horrid sympathy; for what they saw
they felt themselv now changing; down their arm
down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;
and the dire hiss renew and the dire form
catch by contagion; like in punish
as in their crime thu wa the applaus they meant
turn to explod hiss triumph to shame
cast on themselv from their own mouth there stood
a grove hard by sprung up with thi their chang

yet parch with scald thirst and hunger fierc
though to delud them sent could not abstain;
but on they roll in heap and up the tree
climb sat thicker than the snaki lock
that curl megaera: greedili they pluck
the fruitag fair to sight like that which grew
near that bitumin lake where sodom flamed;
thi more delus not the touch but tast
deceived; they fondli think to allay
their appetit with gust instead of fruit
chew bitter ash which the offend tast
with spatter nois rejected: oft they assay
hunger and thirst constraining; drug as oft
with hatefullest disrelish writh their jaw
with soot and cinder filled; so oft they fell
into the same illus not as man

and worn with famin long and ceaseless hiss
till their lost shape permit they resumed;
yearli enjoin some say to undergo

howev some tradit they dispers

what thinkest thou of our empir now though earn

to gratifi my scorn enemi
that laugh as if transport with some fit

and know not that i call and drew them thither
my hell-hound to lick up the draff and filth
which man pollut sin with taint hath shed

then heaven and earth renew shall be made pure

till then the curs pronounc on both preced

who can extenu thee? next to the son
destin restor of mankind by whom

or down from heaven descend--such wa their song;
while the creator call forth by name
hi mighti angel gave them sever charg
as sort best with present thing the sun
had first hi precept so to move so shine
as might affect the earth with cold and heat
scarc tolerable; and from the north to call

solstiti summer heat to the blanc moon
her offic they prescribed; to the other five
their planetari motion and aspect
in sextil squar and trine and opposit
of noxiou efficaci and when to join

their influenc malign when to shower
which of them rise with the sun or fall
should prove tempestuous: to the wind they set
their corner when with bluster to confound
sea air and shore; the thunder when to roll
with terrour through the dark aereal hall
some say he bid hi angel turn ascans
the pole of earth twice ten degre and more
from the sun axle; they with labour push
obliqu the centrick globe: some say the sun
wa bid turn rein from the equinocti road
like distant breadth to tauru with the seven
atlantick sister and the spartan twin
up to the tropick crab: thenc down amain
by leo and the virgin and the scale
as deep as capricorn; to bring in chang
of season to each clime; els had the spring
perpetu smile on earth with vernant flower
equal in day and night except to those
beyond the polar circles; to them day
had unbenight shone while the low sun
to recompens hi distanc in their sight
had round still the horizon and not known
or east or west; which had forbid the snow
from cold estotiland and south as far
beneath magellan at that tast fruit

avoid pinch cold and scorch heat?
these chang in the heaven though slow produc
like chang on sea and land; sider blast
vapour and mist and exhal hot
corrupt and pestilent: now from the north
of norumbega and the samo shore
burst their brazen dungeon arm with ice
and snow and hail and stormi gust and flaw
borea and caecia and argest loud
and thrascia rend the wood and sea upturn;
with advers blast upturn them from the south
notu and afer black with thunder cloud

sirocco and libecchio thu began
outrag from lifeless things; but discord first
daughter of sin among the irrat
death introduc through fierc antipathy:
beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
and fish with fish; to graze the herb all leav
devour each other; nor stood much in awe
of man but fled him; or with counten grim
glare on him pass these were from without
the grow miseri which adam saw
alreadi in part though hid in gloomiest shade
to sorrow abandon but wors felt within;
and in a troubl sea of passion tost
thu to disburden sought with sad complaint
o miser of happy! is thi the end
of thi new gloriou world and me so late
the glori of that glori who now becom
accurs of blessed? hide me from the face
of god whom to behold wa then my highth
of happiness!--yet well if here would end
the misery; i deserv it and would bear
my own deservings; but thi will not serve:
all that i eat or drink or shall beget
is propag curs o voic onc heard
delight encreas and multiply;
now death to hear! for what can i encreas
or multipli but curs on my head?
who of all age to succeed but feel
the evil on him brought by me will curs
my head? ill fare our ancestor impur
for thi we may thank adam! but hi thank
shall be the execration: so besid
mine own that bide upon me all from me
shall with a fierc reflux on me rebound;
on me as on their natur center light
heavi though in their place o fleet joy
of paradis dear bought with last woes!
did i request thee maker from my clay
to mould me man? did i solicit thee
from dark to promot me or here place
in thi delici garden? as my will
concur not to my be it were but right
and equal to reduc me to my dust;
desir to resign and render back
all i received; unabl to perform
thi term too hard by which i wa to hold
the good i sought not to the loss of that
suffici penalti whi hast thou ad
the sens of endless woes? inexplic
whi am i mock with death and lengthen out
to deathless pain? how gladli would i meet
mortal my sentenc and be earth
insensible! how glad would lay me down
as in my mother lap! there i should rest
and sleep secure; hi dread voic no more
would thunder in my ears; no fear of wors
to me and to my offspr would torment me
with cruel expect yet one doubt
pursu me still lest all i cannot die;
lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man
which god inspir cannot togeth perish
with thi corpor clod; then in the grave
or in some other dismal place who know
but i shall die a live death? o thought
horrid if true! yet why? it wa but breath
of life that sinned; what die but what had life
and sin? the bodi properli had neither
all of me then shall die: let thi appeas
the doubt sinc human reach no further know
for though the lord of all be infinit
is hi wrath also? be it man is not so
but mortal doom how can he exercis
wrath without end on man whom death must end?
can he make deathless death? that were to make
strang contradict which to god himself
imposs is held; as argument
of weak not of power will he draw out
for anger sake finit to infinit
in punish man to satisfi hi rigour
satisfi never? that were to extend
hi sentenc beyond dust and natur law;
by which all caus els accord still
to the recept of their matter act;
not to the extent of their own sphere but say
that death be not one stroke as i suppos
bereav sens but endless miseri
from thi day onward; which i feel begun
both in me and without me; and so last
to perpetuity;--ay me!that fear
come thunder back with dread revolut
on my defenceless head; both death and i
am found etern and incorpor both;
nor i on my part single; in me all
poster stand cursed: fair patrimoni
that i must leav ye sons! o were i abl
to wast it all myself and leav ye none!
so disinherit how would you bless
me now your curse! ah whi should all mankind
for one man fault thu guiltless be condemn
it guiltless? but from me what can proceed
but all corrupt; both mind and will deprav
not to do onli but to will the same
with me? how can they then acquit stand
in sight of god? him after all disput
forc i absolve: all my evas vain
and reason though through maze lead me still
but to my own conviction: first and last
on me me onli as the sourc and spring
of all corrupt all the blame light due;
so might the wrath! fond wish!couldst thou support
that burden heavier than the earth to bear;
than all the world much heavier though divid
with that bad woman? thu what thou desirest
and what thou fearest alik destroy all hope
of refug and conclud thee miser
beyond all past exampl and future;
to satan onli like both crime and doom
o conscience! into what abyss of fear
and horrour hast thou driven me; out of which
i find no way from deep to deeper plunged!
thu adam to himself lament loud
through the still night; not now as ere man fell
wholesom and cool and mild but with black air
accompanied; with damp and dread gloom;
which to hi evil conscienc repres
all thing with doubl terrour: on the ground
outstretch he lay on the cold ground; and oft
curs hi creation; death as oft accus
of tardi execut sinc denounc
the day of hi offenc whi come not death
said he with one thrice-accept stroke
to end me? shall truth fail to keep her word
justic divin not hasten to be just?
but death come not at call; justic divin
mend not her slowest pace for prayer or cri
o wood o fountain hillock dale and bowers!
with other echo late i taught your shade
to answer and resound far other song--
whom thu afflict when sad eve beheld
desol where she sat approach nigh
soft word to hi fierc passion she assayed:
but her with stern regard he thu repel
out of my sight thou serpent! that name best
befit thee with him leagu thyself as fals
and hateful; noth want but that thi shape
like hi and colour serpentin may show
thi inward fraud; to warn all creatur from thee
henceforth; lest that too heavenli form pretend
to hellish falshood snare them! but for thee
i had persist happy; had not thi pride
and wander vaniti when least wa safe
reject my forewarn and disdain
not to be trusted; long to be seen
though by the devil himself; him overween
to over-reach; but with the serpent meet
fool and beguiled; by him thou i by thee
to trust thee from my side; imagin wise
constant matur proof against all assaults;
and understood not all wa but a show
rather than solid virtue; all but a rib
crook by natur bent as now appear
more to the part sinist from me drawn;
well if thrown out as supernumerari
to my just number found o! whi did god
creator wise that peopl highest heaven
with spirit masculin creat at last

with men as angel without feminine;
or find some other way to gener
mankind? thi mischief had not been befallen
and more that shall befall; innumer

and strait conjunct with thi sex: for either
he never shall find out fit mate but such
as some misfortun bring him or mistake;
or whom he wish most shall seldom gain
through her pervers but shall see her gain
by a far worse; or if she love withheld
by parents; or hi happiest choic too late
shall meet alreadi link and wedlock-bound
to a fell adversari hi hate or shame:
which infinit calam shall caus

while yet we live scarc one short hour perhap
between us two let there be peace; both join

would speed befor thee and be louder heard
that on my head all might be visited;
thi frailti and infirm sex forgiven
to me commit and by me expos
but rise;--let us no more contend nor blame
each other blame enough elsewhere; but strive
in offic of love how we may lighten
each other burden in our share of woe;
sinc thi day death denounc if aught i see
will prove no sudden but a slow-pac evil;
a long day die to augment our pain;
and to our seed (o hapless seed!) deriv
to whom thu eve recov heart repli
adam by sad experi i know
how littl weight my word with thee can find

restor by thee vile as i am to place

thi love the sole content of my heart
live or die from thee i will not hide
what thought in my unquiet breast are risen
tend to some relief of our extrem

as in our evil and of easier choic
if care of our descent perplex us most
which must be born to certain woe devour
by death at last; and miser it is
to be to other caus of miseri
our own begotten and of our loin to bring
into thi curs world a woeful race
that after wretch life must be at last
food for so foul a monster; in thi power
it lie yet ere concept to prevent
the race unblest to be yet unbegot
childless thou art childless remain: so death
shall be deceiv hi glut and with us two
be forc to satisfi hi raven maw
but if thou judg it hard and difficult
convers look love to abstain
from love due right nuptial embrac sweet;
and with desir to languish without hope
befor the present object languish
with like desire; which would be miseri
and torment less than none of what we dread;
then both ourselv and seed at onc to free
from what we fear for both let us make short --
let us seek death; -- or he not found suppli
with our own hand hi offic on ourselves:
whi stand we longer shiver under fear
that show no end but death and have the power
of mani way to die the shortest choos
destruct with destruct to destroy? --
she end here or vehement despair
broke off the rest: so much of death her thought
had entertain as dy her cheek with pale
but adam with such counsel noth sway
to better hope hi more attent mind
labour had raised; and thu to eve repli
eve thi contempt of life and pleasur seem
to argu in thee someth more sublim
and excel than what thi mind contemns;
but self-destruct therefor sought refut
that excel thought in thee; and impli
not thi contempt but anguish and regret
for loss of life and pleasur overlov
or if thou covet death as utmost end
of miseri so think to evad
the penalti pronounced; doubt not but god
hath wiseli arm hi veng ire than so
to be forestalled; much more i fear lest death
so snatch will not exempt us from the pain
we are by doom to pay; rather such act
of contumaci will provok the highest
to make death in us live: then let us seek
some safer resolut which methink
i have in view call to mind with heed
part of our sentenc that thi seed shall bruis
the serpent head; piteou amends! unless
be meant whom i conjectur our grand foe
satan; who in the serpent hath contriv
against us thi deceit: to crush hi head
would be reveng indeed! which will be lost
by death brought on ourselv or childless day
resolv as thou proposest; so our foe
shal scape hi punish ordain and we
instead shall doubl our upon our head
no more be mention then of violenc
against ourselves; and wil barren
that cut us off from hope; and savour onli
rancour and pride impati and despit
reluct against god and hi just yoke
laid on our neck rememb with what mild
and graciou temper he both heard and judg
without wrath or reviling; we expect
immedi dissolut which we thought
wa meant by death that day; when lo!to thee
pain onli in child-bear were foretold
and bring forth; soon recompens with joy
fruit of thi womb: on me the curs aslop
glanc on the ground; with labour i must earn
my bread; what harm? idl had been worse;
my labour will sustain me; and lest cold
or heat should injur us hi time care

how much more if we pray him will hi ear

and teach us further by what mean to shun

which now the sky with variou face begin

to whom the father without cloud seren

but longer in that paradis to dwell
the law i gave to natur him forbids:

hi final remedy; and after life
tri in sharp tribul and refin
by faith and faith work to second life
wake in the renov of the just
resign him up with heaven and earth renew
but let us call to synod all the blest
through heaven wide bounds: from them i will not hide

if patient thi bid they obey
dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal
to adam what shall come in futur day
as i shall thee enlighten; intermix
my coven in the woman seed renewed;
so send them forth though sorrow yet in peace:
and on the east side of the garden place
where entranc up from eden easiest climb
cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame
wide-waving; all approach far off to fright
and guard all passag to the tree of life:
lest paradis a receptacl prove
to spirit foul and all my tree their prey;
with whose stolen fruit man onc more to delud
he ceased; and the arch-angelick power prepar
for swift descent; with him the cohort bright
of watch cherubim: four face each
had like a doubl janus; all their shape
spangl with eye more numer than those

charm with arcadian pipe the pastor reed
of herm or hi opiat rod mean while
to re-salut the world with sacr light
leucothea waked; and with fresh dew imbalm
the earth; when adam and first matron eve
had end now their orison and found
strength ad from above; new hope to spring
out of despair; joy but with fear yet linked;
which thu to eve hi welcom word renew
eve easili my faith admit that all
the good which we enjoy from heaven descends;
but that from us aught should ascend to heaven
so preval as to concern the mind
of god high-blest or to inclin hi will
hard to belief may seem; yet thi will prayer
or one short sigh of human breath upborn
even to the seat of god for sinc i sought
by prayer the offend deiti to appease;

methought i saw him placabl and mild
bend hi ear; persuas in me grew
that i wa heard with favour; peac return

hi promis that thi seed shall bruis our foe;
which then not mind in dismay yet now

to whom thu eve with sad demeanour meek

who highli thu to entitl me vouchsafst
far other name deserv but the field
to labour call us now with sweat impos
though after sleepless night; for see!th morn

her rosi progress smiling: let us forth;
i never from thi side henceforth to stray
whereer our day work lie though now enjoin
labori till day droop; while here we dwell
what can be toilsom in these pleasant walks?
here let us live though in fallen state content
so spake so wish much humbl eve; but fate
subscrib not: natur first gave sign impress
on bird beast air; air suddenli eclips
after short blush of morn; nigh in her sight
the bird of jove stoop from hi aeri tour
two bird of gayest plume befor him drove;
down from a hill the beast that reign in wood
first hunter then pursu a gentl brace
goodliest of all the forest hart and hind;
direct to the eastern gate wa bent their flight

pursu not unmov to eve thu spake
o eve some further chang await us nigh
which heaven by these mute sign in natur show

us hapli too secur of our discharg
from penalti becaus from death releas
some days: how long and what till then our life
who knows? or more than thi that we are dust
and thither must return and be no more?
whi els thi doubl object in our sight
of flight pursu in the air and oer the ground
one way the self-sam hour? whi in the east

more orient in yon western cloud that draw
oer the blue firmament a radiant white

he er not; for by thi the heavenli band
down from a sky of jasper light now
in paradis and on a hill made halt;
a gloriou apparit had not doubt
and carnal fear that day dim adam eye
not that more gloriou when the angel met
jacob in mahanaim where he saw
the field pavilion with hi guardian bright;
nor that which on the flame mount appear
in dothan cover with a camp of fire
against the syrian king who to surpris
one man assassin-lik had levi war

new law to be observed; for i descri
from yonder blaze cloud that veil the hill
one of the heavenli host; and by hi gait

that i should fear; nor sociabl mild
as raphael that i should much confide;
but solemn and sublime; whom not to offend
with rever i must meet and thou retir
he ended: and the arch-angel soon drew nigh
not in hi shape celesti but as man
clad to meet man; over hi lucid arm
a militari vest of purpl flow
liveli than meliboean or the grain
of sarra worn by king and hero old
in time of truce; iri had dipt the woof;
hi starri helm unbuckl show him prime
in manhood where youth ended; by hi side
as in a glister zodiack hung the sword

suffici that thi prayer are heard; and death

defeat of hi seisur mani day
given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent
and one bad act with mani deed well done
mayest cover: well may then thi lord appeas
redeem thee quit from death rapaci claim;
but longer in thi paradis to dwell
permit not: to remov thee i am come
and send thee from the garden forth to till
the ground whenc thou wast taken fitter soil
he ad not; for adam at the news
heart-struck with chill gripe of sorrow stood
that all hi sens bound; eve who unseen
yet all had heard with audibl lament
discov soon the place of her retir
o unexpect stroke wors than of death!
must i thu leav thee$ paradise? thu leav
thee nativ soil! these happi walk and shade
fit haunt of gods? where i had hope to spend
quiet though sad the respit of that day
that must be mortal to us both o flower
that never will in other climat grow
my earli visit and my last

from the first open bud and gave ye names!
who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
your tribe and water from the ambrosi fount?
thee lastli nuptial bower! by me adorn
with what to sight or smell wa sweet! from thee
how shall i part and whither wander down

less pure accustom to immort fruits?
whom thu the angel interrupt mild
lament not eve but patient resign
what justli thou hast lost nor set thi heart
thu over-fond on that which is not thine:
thi go is not lonely; with thee goe

where he abid think there thi nativ soil
adam by thi from the cold sudden damp

to michael thu hi humbl word address
celesti whether among the throne or name
of them the highest; for such of shape may seem
princ abov princes! gentli hast thou told
thi messag which might els in tell wound
and in perform end us; what besid
of sorrow and deject and despair
our frailti can sustain thi tide bring
departur from thi happi place our sweet
recess and onli consol left
familiar to our eyes! all place els
inhospit appear and desolate;
nor know us nor known: and if by prayer
incess i could hope to chang the will
of him who all thing can i would not ceas
to weari him with my assidu cries:
but prayer against hi absolut decre
no more avail than breath against the wind
blown stifl back on him that breath it forth:
therefor to hi great bid i submit
thi most afflict me that depart henc

hi bless countenance: here i could frequent
with worship place by place where he vouchsaf
presenc divine; and to my son relat
on thi mount he appeared; under thi tree
stood visible; among these pine hi voic

so mani grate altar i would rear
of grassi turf and pile up everi stone
of lustr from the brook in memori
or monument to ages; and theron
offer sweet-smel gum and fruit and flowers:
in yonder nether world where shall i seek
hi bright appear or foot-step trace?
for though i fled him angri yet recal
to life prolong and promis race i now
gladli behold though but hi utmost skirt

to whom thu michael with regard benign
adam thou knowest heaven hi and all the earth;
not thi rock only; hi omnipres fill
land sea and air and everi kind that live

all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
no despic gift; surmis not then
hi presenc to these narrow bound confin
of paradis or eden: thi had been
perhap thi capit seat from whenc had spread
all generations; and had hither come
from all the end of the earth to celebr
and rever thee their great progenitor
but thi pre-emin thou hast lost brought down
to dwell on even ground now with thi sons:
yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
god is as here; and will be found alik
present; and of hi presenc mani a sign
still follow thee still compass thee round
with good and patern love hi face
express and of hi step the track divin
which that thou mayest believ and be confirm
ere thou from henc depart; know i am sent
to show thee what shall come in futur day
to thee and to thi offspring: good with bad
expect to hear; supern grace contend
with sin of men; therebi to learn
true patienc and to temper joy with fear
and piou sorrow; equal inur
by moder either state to bear
prosper or adverse: so shalt thou lead
safest thi life and best prepar endur
thi mortal passag when it comes--ascend
thi hill; let eve (for i have drench her eyes)
here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;
as onc thou sleptst while she to life wa form
to whom thu adam grate repli

howev chastening; to the evil turn
my obviou breast; arm to overcom

if so i may attain -- so both ascend
in the vision of god it wa a hill
of paradis the highest; from whose top
the hemispher of earth in clearest ken
stretch out to the amplest reach of prospect lay
not higher that hill nor wider look round
whereon for differ caus the tempter set
our second adam in the wilderness;
to show him all earth kingdom and their glori
hi eye might there command wherev stood

of atabalipa; and yet unspoil
guiana whose great citi geryon son
call el dorado but to nobler sight
michael from adam eye the film remov
which that fals fruit that promis clearer sight
had bred; then purg with euphrasi and rue
the visual nerv for he had much to see;
and from the well of life three drop instil
so deep the power of these ingredi pierc
even to the inmost seat of mental sight
that adam now enforc to close hi eye
sunk down and all hi spirit becam entranced;
but him the gentl angel by the hand
soon rais and hi attent thu recal
adam now ope thine eyes; and first behold
the effect which thi origin crime hath wrought
in some to spring from thee; who never touch
the except tree; nor with the snake conspired;
nor sin thi sin; yet from that sin deriv
corrupt to bring forth more violent deed
hi eye he open and beheld a field
part arabl and tilth whereon were sheav
new reaped; the other part sheep-walk and folds;
i the midst an altar as the land-mark stood
rustick of grassi sord; thither anon
a sweati reaper from hi tillag brought
first fruit the green ear and the yellow sheaf
uncul as came to hand; a shepherd next
more meek came with the firstl of hi flock
choicest and best; then sacrif laid
the inward and their fat with incens strow
on the cleft wood and all due right performed:
hi offer soon propiti fire from heaven
consum with nimbl glanc and grate steam;
the other not for hi wa not sincere;
whereat he inli rage and as they talk
smote him into the midriff with a stone
that beat out life; he fell;and deadli pale
groan out hi soul with gush blood effus
much at that sight wa adam in hi heart
dismay and thu in hast to the angel cri
o teacher some great mischief hath befallen
to that meek man who well had sacrificed;
is pieti thu and pure devot paid?
to whom michael thu he also move repli
these two are brethren adam and to come
out of thi loins; the unjust the just hath slain
for envi that hi brother offer found
from heaven acceptance; but the bloodi fact
will be avenged; and the other faith approv
lose no reward; though here thou see him die
roll in dust and gore to which our sire
alas! both for the deed and for the cause!
but have i now seen death? is thi the way
i must return to nativ dust? o sight
of terrour foul and ugli to behold
horrid to think how horribl to feel!
to whom thu michael death thou hast seen
in hi first shape on man; but mani shape
of death and mani are the way that lead
to hi grim cave all dismal; yet to sens
more terribl at the entranc than within
some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die;
by fire flood famin by intemper more
in meat and drink which on the earth shall bring
diseas dire of which a monstrou crew
befor thee shall appear; that thou mayest know
what miseri the inabstin of eve
shall bring on men immedi a place
befor hi eye appear sad noisom dark;
a lazar-hous it seemed; wherein were laid

intestin stone and ulcer colick-pang

and over them triumphant death hi dart
shook but delay to strike though oft invok
with vow as their chief good and final hope
sight so deform what heart of rock could long
dry-ey behold? adam could not but wept
though not of woman born; compass quell
hi best of man and gave him up to tear
a space till firmer thought restrain excess;
and scarc recov word hi plaint renew
o miser mankind to what fall

better end here unborn whi is life given
to be thu wrest from us? rather whi

their maker imag answer michael then
forsook them when themselv they vilifi
to serv ungovern appetite; and took
hi imag whom they serv a brutish vice

therefor so abject is their punish
disfigur not god like but their own;

i yield it just said adam and submit
but is there yet no other way besid
these pain passag how we may come
to death and mix with our connatur dust?
there is said michael if thou well observ
the rule of not too much; by temper taught
in what thou eatest and drinkest; seek from thenc
due nourish not glutton delight
till mani year over thi head return:
so mayest thou live; till like ripe fruit thou drop
into thi mother lap; or be with eas
gather nor harshli plucked; for death mature:
thi is old age; but then thou must outliv
thi youth thi strength thi beauty; which will chang
to wither weak and gray; thi sens then
obtus all tast of pleasur must forego
to what thou hast; and for the air of youth
hope and cheer in thi blood will reign
a melancholi damp of cold and dri
to weigh thi spirit down and last consum
the balm of life to whom our ancestor
henceforth i fli not death nor would prolong
life much; bent rather how i may be quit
fairest and easiest of thi cumbrou charge;
which i must keep till my appoint day
of render up and patient attend
my dissolut michael repli
nor love thi life nor hate; but what thou livest
live well; how long or short permit to heaven:
and now prepar thee for anoth sight
he look and saw a spaciou plain whereon
were tent of variou hue; by some were herd
of cattl grazing; other whenc the sound
of instrument that made melodi chime
wa heard of harp and organ; and who move
their stop and chord wa seen; hi volant touch
instinct through all proport low and high
fled and pursu transvers the reson fugu
in other part stood one who at the forg
labour two massi clod of iron and brass
had melt (whether found where casual fire
had wast wood on mountain or in vale
down to the vein of earth; thenc glide hot
to some cave mouth; or whether wash by stream
from underground;) the liquid ore he drain
into fit mould prepared; from which he form
first hi own tools; then what might els be wrought
fusil or graven in metal after these
but on the hither side a differ sort
from the high neighbour hill which wa their seat
down to the plain descended; by their guis
just men they seem and all their studi bent
to worship god aright and know hi work
not hid; nor those thing last which might preserv
freedom and peac to men; they on the plain
long had not walk when from the tent behold!
a bevi of fair women richli gay
in gem and wanton dress; to the harp they sung
soft amor ditti and in danc came on:
the men though grave eye them; and let their eye
rove without rein; till in the amor net
fast caught they liked; and each hi like chose;
and now of love they treat till the evening-star
love harbing appeared; then all in heat
they light the nuptial torch and bid invok
hymen then first to marriag rite invoked:
with feast and musick all the tent resound
such happi interview and fair event
of love and youth not lost song garland flower
and charm symphoni attach the heart
of adam soon inclin to admit delight
the bent of nature; which he thu express
true open of mine eye prime angel blest;
much better seem thi vision and more hope
of peac day portend than those two past;
those were of hate and death or pain much worse;
here natur seem fulfil in all her end
to whom thu michael judg not what is best
by pleasur though to natur seem meet;
creat as thou art to nobler end
holi and pure conform divin
those tent thou sawest so pleasant were the tent
of wicked wherein shall dwell hi race
who slew hi brother; studiou they appear
of art that polish life invent rare;
unmind of their maker though hi spirit
taught them; but they hi gift acknowledg none
yet they a beauteou offspr shall beget;
for that fair femal troop thou sawest that seem
of goddess so blith so smooth so gay
yet empti of all good wherein consist
woman domestick honour and chief praise;
bred onli and complet to the tast
of lust appet to sing to danc
to dress and troll the tongu and roll the eye:
to these that sober race of men whose live
religi titl them the son of god
shall yield up all their virtu all their fame
ignobl to the train and to the smile
of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy
erelong to swim at large; and laugh for which
the world erelong a world of tear must weep
to whom thu adam of short joy bereft
o piti and shame that they who to live well
enter so fair should turn asid to tread
path indirect or in the mid way faint!
but still i see the tenour of man woe
hold on the same from woman to begin
from man effemin slack it begin
said the angel who should better hold hi place
by wisdom and superiour gift receiv
but now prepar thee for anoth scene
he look and saw wide territori spread
befor him town and rural work between;
citi of men with lofti gate and tower
concours in arm fierc face threaten war
giant of mighti bone and bold emprise;
part wield their arm part curb the foam steed
singl or in array of battl rang
both hors and foot nor idli muster stood;
one way a band select from forag drive
a herd of beev fair oxen and fair kine
from a fat meadow ground; or fleeci flock
ewe and their bleat lamb over the plain
their booty; scarc with life the shepherd fli
but call in aid which make a bloodi fray;
with cruel tournament the squadron join;
where cattl pastur late now scatter lie
with carcass and arm the ensanguin field
deserted: other to a citi strong
lay sieg encamped; by batteri scale and mine
assaulting; other from the wall defend
with dart and javelin stone and sulphur fire;
on each hand slaughter and gigantick deed
in other part the scepter herald call
to council in the city-gates; anon
gray-head men and grave with warriour mix
assembl and harangu are heard; but soon
in factiou opposition; till at last
of middl age one rise emin
in wise deport spake much of right and wrong
of justic or religion truth and peac
and judgement from above: him old and young
explod and had seiz with violent hand
had not a cloud descend snatch him thenc
unseen amid the throng: so violenc
proceed and oppress and sword-law
through all the plain and refug none wa found
adam wa all in tear and to hi guid
lament turn full sad; o!what are these
death minist not men? who thu deal death
inhumanli to men and multipli
ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
hi brother: for of whom such massacr
make they but of their brethren; men of men
but who wa that just man whom had not heaven
rescu had in hi righteous been lost?
to whom thu michael these are the product
of those ill-mat marriag thou sawest;
where good with bad were match who of themselv
abhor to join; and by imprud mix
produc prodigi birth of bodi or mind
such were these giant men of high renown;
for in those day might onli shall be admir
and valour and heroick virtu called;
to overcom in battl and subdu
nation and bring home spoil with infinit
man-slaught shall be held the highest pitch
of human glory; and for glori done
of triumph to be style great conquerour
patron of mankind god and son of gods;
destroy rightlier call and plagu of men
thu fame shall be achiev renown on earth;
and what most merit fame in silenc hid
but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
the onli righteou in a world prevers
and therefor hate therefor so beset
with foe for dare singl to be just
and utter odiou truth that god would come
to judg them with hi saints; him the most high
rapt in a balmi cloud with wing steed
did as thou sawest receiv to walk with god
high in salvat and the clime of bliss
exempt from death; to show thee what reward
await the good; the rest what punishment;
which now direct thine eye and soon behold
he look and saw the face of thing quit changed;
the brazen throat of war had ceas to roar;
all now wa turn to jolliti and game
to luxuri and riot feast and dance;
marri or prostitut as befel
rape or adulteri where pass fair
allur them; thenc from cup to civil broil
at length a reverend sire among them came
and of their do great dislik declar
and testifi against their ways; he oft
frequent their assembl whereso met
triumph or festivals; and to them preach
convers and repent as to soul
in prison under judgement imminent:
but all in vain: which when he saw he ceas
contend and remov hi tent far off;
then from the mountain hew timber tall
began to build a vessel of huge bulk;
measur by cubit length and breadth and highth;
smear round with pitch; and in the side a door
contrived; and of provis laid in larg
for man and beast: when lo a wonder strange!
of everi beast and bird and insect small
came seven and pairs; and enter in as taught
their order: last the sire and hi three son
with their four wives; and god made fast the door
mean while the south-wind rose and with black wing
wide-hov all the cloud togeth drove
from under heaven; the hill to their suppli
vapour and exhal dusk and moist
sent up amain; and now the thicken sky
like a dark ciel stood; down rush the rain
impetuous; and continu till the earth
no more wa seen: the float vessel swum
uplift and secur with beak prow
rode tilt oer the waves; all dwell els
flood overwhelm and them with all their pomp
deep under water rolled; sea cover sea
sea without shore; and in their palac
where luxuri late reign sea-monst whelp
and stabled; of mankind so numer late
all left in one small bottom swum imbark
how didst thou griev then adam to behold
the end of all thi offspr end so sad
depopulation! thee anoth flood
of tear and sorrow a flood thee also drown
and sunk thee as thi sons; till gentli rear
by the angel on thi feet thou stoodest at last
though comfortless; as when a father mourn
hi children all in view destroy at once;
and scarc to the angel utterdst thu thi plaint
o vision ill foreseen! better had i
live ignor of future! so had born
my part of evil onli each day lot
enough to bear; those now that were dispens
the burden of mani age on me light
at onc by my foreknowledg gain birth
abort to torment me ere their be
with thought that they must be let no man seek
henceforth to be foretold what shall befal
him or hi children; evil he may be sure
which neither hi foreknow can prevent;
and he the futur evil shall no less
in apprehens than in substanc feel
grievou to bear: but that care now is past
man is not whom to warn: those few escap
famin and anguish will at last consum
wander that wateri desart: i had hope
when violenc wa ceas and war on earth
all would have then gone well; peac would have crown
with length of happi day the race of man;
but i wa far deceived; for now i see
peac to corrupt no less than war to wast
how come it thus? unfold celesti guid
and whether here the race of man will end
to whom thu michael those whom last thou sawest
in triumph and luxuri wealth are they
first seen in act of prowess emin
and great exploit but of true virtu void;
who have spilt much blood and done much wast
subdu nation and achiev therebi
fame in the world high titl and rich prey;
shall chang their cours to pleasur eas and sloth
surfeit and lust; till wanton and pride
rais out of friendship hostil deed in peac
the conquer also and enslav by war
shall with their freedom lost all virtu lose
and fear of god; from whom their pieti feign
in sharp contest of battl found no aid
against invaders; therefor cool in zeal
thenceforth shall practic how to live secur
worldli or dissolut on what their lord
shall leav them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear
more than enough that temper may be tried:
so all shall turn degener all depraved;
justic and temper truth and faith forgot;
one man except the onli son of light
in a dark age against exampl good
against allur custom and a world
offended: fearless of reproach and scorn
the grand-child with twelv son encreas depart
from canaan to a land hereaft call
egypt divid by the river nile;
see where it flow disgorg at seven mouth
into the sea: to sojourn in that land
he come invit by a younger son
in time of dearth; a son whose worthi deed
rais him to be the second in that realm
of pharaoh: there he die and leav hi race
grow into a nation and now grown
suspect to a sequent king who seek
to stop their overgrowth as inmat guest
or violenc he of their wick way
shall them admonish; and befor them set
the path of righteous how much more safe
and full of peace; denounc wrath to come
on their impenitence; and shall return
of them derid but of god observ
the one just man alive; by hi command
shall build a wonder ark as thou beheldst
to save himself and houshold from amidst
a world devot to univers wrack
no sooner he with them of man and beast
select for life shall in the ark be lodg
and shelter round; but all the cataract
of heaven set open on the earth shall pour
rain day and night; all fountain of the deep
broke up shall heav the ocean to usurp
beyond all bounds; till inund rise
abov the highest hills: then shall thi mount
of paradis by might of wave be move
out of hi place push by the horn flood
with all hi verdur spoil and tree adrift
down the great river to the open gulf
and there take root an island salt and bare
the haunt of seal and orc and sea-mew clang:
to teach thee that god attribut to place
no sanctiti if none be thither brought
by men who there frequent or therein dwell
and now what further shall ensu behold
he look and saw the ark hull on the flood
which now abated; for the cloud were fled
driven by a keen north-wind that blow dri
wrinkl the face of delug as decayed;
and the clear sun on hi wide wateri glass
gaze hot and of the fresh wave larg drew
as after thirst; which made their flow shrink
from stand lake to trip ebb that stole
with soft foot toward the deep; who now had stopt
hi sluce as the heaven hi window shut
the ark no more now float but seem on ground
fast on the top of some high mountain fix
and now the top of hill as rock appear;
with clamour thenc the rapid current drive
toward the retreat sea their furiou tide
forthwith from out the ark a raven fli
and after him the surer messeng
a dove sent forth onc and again to spi
green tree or ground whereon hi foot may light:
the second time return in hi bill
an olive-leaf he bring pacifick sign:
anon dri ground appear and from hi ark
the ancient sire descend with all hi train;
then with uplift hand and eye devout
grate to heaven over hi head behold
a dewi cloud and in the cloud a bow
conspicu with three lift colour gay
betoken peac from god and coven new
whereat the heart of adam erst so sad
greatli rejoiced; and thu hi joy broke forth
o thou who futur thing canst repres
as present heavenli instructer! i reviv
at thi last sight; assur that man shall live
with all the creatur and their seed preserv
far less i now lament for one whole world
of wick son destroy than i rejoic
for one man found so perfect and so just
that god vouchsaf to rais anoth world
from him and all hi anger to forget
but say what mean those colour streak in heaven
distend as the brow of god appeased?
or serv they as a floweri verg to bind
the fluid skirt of that same wateri cloud
lest it again dissolv and shower the earth?
to whom the arch-angel dextrous thou aimest;
so willingli doth god remit hi ire
though late repent him of man depraved;
griev at hi heart when look down he saw
the whole earth fill with violenc and all flesh
corrupt each their way; yet those remov
such grace shall one just man find in hi sight
that he relent not to blot out mankind;
and make a coven never to destroy
the earth again by flood; nor let the sea
surpass hi bounds; nor rain to drown the world
with man therein or beast; but when he bring
over the earth a cloud will therein set
hi triple-colour bow whereon to look
and call to mind hi covenant: day and night
seed-tim and harvest heat and hoari frost
shall hold their course; till fire purg all thing new
both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell



book xii


as one who in hi journey bate at noon
though bent on speed; so here the arch-angel paus
betwixt the world destroy and world restor
if adam aught perhap might interpose;
then with transit sweet new speech resum
thu thou hast seen one world begin and end;
and man as from a second stock proceed
much thou hast yet to see; but i perceiv
thi mortal sight to fail; object divin
must need impair and weari human sense:
henceforth what is to come i will relate;
thou therefor give due audienc and attend
thi second sourc of men while yet but few
and while the dread of judgement past remain
fresh in their mind fear the deiti
with some regard to what is just and right
shall lead their live and multipli apace;
labour the soil and reap plenteou crop
corn wine and oil; and from the herd or flock
oft sacrif bullock lamb or kid
with larg wine-off pour and sacr feast
shall spend their day in joy unblamed; and dwell
long time in peac by famili and tribe
under patern rule: till one shall rise
of proud ambiti heart; who not content
with fair equal fratern state
will arrog dominion undeserv
over hi brethren and quit dispossess
concord and law of natur from the earth;
hunt (and men not beast shall be hi game)
with war and hostil snare such as refus
subject to hi empir tyrannous:
a mighti hunter thenc he shall be style
befor the lord; as in despit of heaven
or from heaven claim second sovranty;
and from rebellion shall deriv hi name
though of rebellion other he accus
he with a crew whom like ambit join
with him or under him to tyrann
march from eden toward the west shall find
the plain wherein a black bitumin gurg
boil out from under ground the mouth of hell:
of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
a citi and tower whose top may reach to heaven;
and get themselv a name; lest far dispers
in foreign land their memori be lost;
regardless whether good or evil fame
but god who oft descend to visit men
unseen and through their habit walk
to mark their do them behold soon
come down to see their citi ere the tower
obstruct heaven-tow and in deris set
upon their tongu a variou spirit to rase
quit out their nativ language; and instead
to sow a jangl nois of word unknown:
forthwith a hideou gabbl rise loud
among the builders; each to other call
not understood; till hoars and all in rage
as mock they storm: great laughter wa in heaven
and look down to see the hubbub strang
and hear the din: thu wa the build left
ridicul and the work confus name
whereto thu adam fatherli displeas
o execr son! so to aspir
abov hi brethren; to himself assum
author usurp from god not given:
he gave us onli over beast fish fowl
dominion absolute; that right we hold
by hi donation; but man over men
he made not lord; such titl to himself
reserv human left from human free
but thi usurp hi encroach proud
stay not on man; to god hi tower intend
sieg and defiance: wretch man!what food
will he convey up thither to sustain
himself and hi rash army; where thin air
abov the cloud will pine hi entrail gross
and famish him of breath if not of bread?
to whom thu michael justli thou abhorrest
that son who on the quiet state of men
such troubl brought affect to subdu
ration liberty; yet know withal
sinc thi origin laps true liberti
is lost which alway with right reason dwell
twin and from her hath no dividu being:
reason in man obscur or not obey
immedi inordin desir
and upstart passion catch the govern
from reason; and to servitud reduc
man till then free therefor sinc he permit
within himself unworthi power to reign
over free reason god in judgement just
subject him from without to violent lords;
who oft as undeservedli enthral
hi outward freedom: tyranni must be;
though to the tyrant therebi no excus
yet sometim nation will declin so low
from virtu which is reason that no wrong
but justic and some fatal curs annex
depriv them of their outward liberty;
their inward lost: wit the irrever son
of him who built the ark; who for the shame
done to hi father heard thi heavi curs
servant of servant on hi viciou race
thu will thi latter as the former world
still tend from bad to worse; till god at last
weari with their iniqu withdraw
hi presenc from among them and avert
hi holi eyes; resolv from thenceforth
to leav them to their own pollut ways;
and one peculiar nation to select
from all the rest of whom to be invok
a nation from one faith man to spring:
him on thi side euphrat yet resid
bred up in idol-worship: o that men
(canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown
while yet the patriarch live who scape the flood
as to forsak the live god and fall
to worship their own work in wood and stone
for gods! yet him god the most high vouchsaf
to call by vision from hi father hous
hi kindr and fals god into a land
which he will show him; and from him will rais
a mighti nation; and upon him shower
hi benedict so that in hi seed
all nation shall be blest: he straight obeys;
not know to what land yet firm believes:
i see him but thou canst not with what faith
he leav hi god hi friend and nativ soil
ur of chaldaea pass now the ford
to haran; after him a cumbrou train
of herd and flock and numer servitude;
not wander poor but trust all hi wealth
with god who call him in a land unknown
canaan he now attains; i see hi tent
pitch about sechem and the neighbour plain
of moreh; there by promis he receiv
gift to hi progeni of all that land
from hameth northward to the desart south;
(thing by their name i call though yet unnamed;)
from hermon east to the great western sea;
mount hermon yonder sea; each place behold
in prospect as i point them; on the shore
mount carmel; here the double-fount stream
jordan true limit eastward; but hi son
shall dwell to senir that long ridg of hill
thi ponder that all nation of the earth
shall in hi seed be blessed: by that seed
is meant thi great deliver who shall bruis
the serpent head; whereof to thee anon
plainlier shall be reveal thi patriarch blest
whom faith abraham due time shall call
a son and of hi son a grand-child leaves;
like him in faith in wisdom and renown:
the grandchild with twelv son increas depart
from canaan to a land hereaft call
egypt divid by the river nile
see where it flow disgorg at seven mouth
into the sea to sojourn in that land
he come invit by a younger son
in time of dearth a son whose worthi deed
rais him to be the second in that realm
of pharaoh there he die and leav hi race
grow into a nation and now grown
suspect to a sequent king who seek
to stop their overgrowth as inmat guest
too numerous; whenc of guest he make them slave
inhospit and kill their infant males:
till by two brethren (these two brethren call
mose and aaron) sent from god to claim
hi peopl from enthral they return
with glori and spoil back to their promis land
but first the lawless tyrant who deni
to know their god or messag to regard
must be compel by sign and judgement dire;
to blood unsh the river must be turned;
frog lice and fli must all hi palac fill
with loath intrus and fill all the land;
hi cattl must of rot and murren die;
botch and blain must all hi flesh emboss
and all hi people; thunder mix with hail
hail mix with fire must rend the egyptian sky
and wheel on the earth devour where it rolls;
what it devour not herb or fruit or grain
a darksom cloud of locust swarm down
must eat and on the ground leav noth green;
dark must overshadow all hi bound
palpabl dark and blot out three days;
last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
of egypt must lie dead thu with ten wound
the river-dragon tame at length submit
to let hi sojourn depart and oft
humbl hi stubborn heart; but still as ice
more harden after thaw; till in hi rage
pursu whom he late dismiss the sea
swallow him with hi host; but them let pass
as on dri land between two crystal walls;
awe by the rod of mose so to stand
divid till hi rescu gain their shore:
such wondrou power god to hi saint will lend
though present in hi angel; who shall go
befor them in a cloud and pillar of fire;
by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire;
to guid them in their journey and remov
behind them while the obdur king pursues:
all night he will pursue; but hi approach
dark defend between till morn watch;
then through the fieri pillar and the cloud
god look forth will troubl all hi host
and craze their chariot-wheels: when by command
mose onc more hi potent rod extend
over the sea; the sea hi rod obeys;
on their embattl rank the wave return
and overwhelm their war: the race elect
safe toward canaan from the shore advanc
through the wild desart not the readiest way;
lest enter on the canaanit alarm
war terrifi them inexpert and fear
return them back to egypt choos rather
inglori life with servitude; for life
to nobl and ignobl is more sweet
untrain in arm where rash lead not on
thi also shall they gain by their delay
in the wide wilderness; there they shall found
their govern and their great senat choos
through the twelv tribe to rule by law ordained:
god from the mount of sinai whose gray top
shall trembl he descend will himself
in thunder lightn and loud trumpet sound
ordain them laws; part such as appertain
to civil justice; part religi rite
of sacrifice; inform them by type
and shadow of that destin seed to bruis
the serpent by what mean he shall achiev
mankind deliver but the voic of god
to mortal ear is dreadful: they beseech
that mose might report to them hi will
and terrour cease; he grant what they besought
instruct that to god is no access
without mediat whose high offic now
mose in figur bears; to introduc
one greater of whose day he shall foretel
and all the prophet in their age the time
of great messiah shall sing thu law and rite
establish such delight hath god in men
obedi to hi will that he vouchsaf
among them to set up hi tabernacle;
the holi one with mortal men to dwell:
by hi prescript a sanctuari is frame
of cedar overlaid with gold; therein
an ark and in the ark hi testimoni
the record of hi covenant; over these
a mercy-seat of gold between the wing
of two bright cherubim; befor him burn
seven lamp as in a zodiack repres
the heavenli fires; over the tent a cloud
shall rest by day a fieri gleam by night;
save when they journey and at length they come
conduct by hi angel to the land
promis to abraham and hi seed:--th rest
were long to tell; how mani battl fought
how mani king destroyed; and kingdom won;
or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still
a day entir and night due cours adjourn
man voic command sun in gibeon stand
and thou moon in the vale of aialon
till israel overcome! so call the third
from abraham son of isaac; and from him
hi whole descent who thu shall canaan win
here adam interpos o sent from heaven
enlighten of my dark graciou thing
thou hast revealed; those chiefli which concern
just abraham and hi seed: now first i find
mine eye true-open and my heart much eased;
erewhil perplex with thought what would becom
of me and all mankind: but now i see
hi day in whom all nation shall be blest;
favour unmerit by me who sought
forbidden knowledg by forbidden mean
thi yet i apprehend not whi to those
among whom god will deign to dwell on earth
so mani and so variou law are given;
so mani law argu so mani sin
among them; how can god with such reside?
to whom thu michael doubt not but that sin
will reign among them as of thee begot;
and therefor wa law given them to evinc
their natur praviti by stir up
sin against law to fight: that when they see
law can discov sin but not remov
save by those shadowi expiat weak
the blood of bull and goat they may conclud
some blood more preciou must be paid for man;
just for unjust; that in such righteous
to them by faith imput they may find
justif toward god and peac
of conscience; which the law by ceremoni
cannot appease; nor man the mortal part
perform; and not perform cannot live
so law appear imperfect; and but given
with purpos to resign them in full time
up to a better covenant; disciplin
from shadowi type to truth; from flesh to spirit;
from imposit of strict law to free
accept of larg grace; from servil fear
to filial; work of law to work of faith
and therefor shall not mose though of god
highli belov be but the minist
of law hi peopl into canaan lead;
but joshua whom the gentil jesu call
hi name and offic bear who shall quell
the adversary-serp and bring back
through the world wilder long-wand man
safe to etern paradis of rest
mean while they in their earthli canaan place
long time shall dwell and prosper but when sin
nation interrupt their publick peac
provok god to rais them enemies;
from whom as oft he save them penit
by judg first then under kings; of whom
the second both for pieti renown
and puissant deed a promis shall receiv
irrevoc that hi regal throne
for ever shall endure; the like shall sing
all propheci that of the royal stock
of david (so i name thi king) shall rise
a son the woman seed to thee foretold
foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust
all nations; and to king foretold of king
the last; for of hi reign shall be no end
but first a long success must ensue;
and hi next son for wealth and wisdom fame
the cloud ark of god till then in tent
wander shall in a gloriou templ enshrin
such follow him as shall be regist
part good part bad; of bad the longer scroll;
whose foul idolatri and other fault
heap to the popular sum will so incens
god as to leav them and expos their land
their citi hi templ and hi holi ark
with all hi sacr thing a scorn and prey
to that proud citi whose high wall thou sawest
left in confusion; babylon thenc call
there in captiv he let them dwell
the space of seventi years; then bring them back
rememb merci and hi coven sworn
to david stablish as the day of heaven
return from babylon by leav of king
their lord whom god dispos the hous of god
they first re-edify; and for a while
in mean estat live moderate; till grown
in wealth and multitud factiou they grow;
but first among the priest dissent spring
men who attend the altar and should most
endeavour peace: their strife pollut bring
upon the templ itself: at last they seis
the scepter and regard not david sons;
then lose it to a stranger that the true
anoint king messiah might be born
bar of hi right; yet at hi birth a star
unseen befor in heaven proclaim him come;
and guid the eastern sage who inquir
hi place to offer incens myrrh and gold:
hi place of birth a solemn angel tell
to simpl shepherd keep watch by night;
they gladli thither hast and by a quir
of squadron angel hear hi carol sung
a virgin is hi mother but hi sire
the power of the most high: he shall ascend
the throne hereditari and bound hi reign
with earth wide bound hi glori with the heaven
he ceas discern adam with such joy
surcharg as had like grief been dew in tear
without the vent of words; which these he breath
o prophet of glad tide finish
of utmost hope! now clear i understand
what oft my steadiest thought have search in vain;
whi our great expect should be call
the seed of woman: virgin mother hail
high in the love of heaven; yet from my loin
thou shalt proceed and from thi womb the son
of god most high: so god with man unites!
need must the serpent now hi capit bruis
expect with mortal pain: say where and when
their fight what stroke shall bruis the victor heel
to whom thu michael dream not of their fight
as of a duel or the local wound
of head or heel: not therefor join the son
manhood to godhead with more strength to foil
thi enemy; nor so is overcom
satan whose fall from heaven a deadlier bruis
disabl not to give thee thi death wound:
which he who come thi saviour shall recur
not by destroy satan but hi work
in thee and in thi seed: nor can thi be
but by fulfil that which thou didst want
obedi to the law of god impos
on penalti of death and suffer death;
the penalti to thi transgress due
and due to their which out of thine will grow:
so onli can high justic rest appaid
the law of god exact he shall fulfil
both by obedi and by love though love
alon fulfil the law; thi punish
he shall endur by come in the flesh
to a reproach life and curs death;
proclaim life to all who shall believ
in hi redemption; and that hi obedi
imput becom their by faith; hi merit
to save them not their own though legal work
for thi he shall live hate be blasphem
seis on by forc judg and to death condemn
a shame and accurs nail to the cross
by hi own nation; slain for bring life:
but to the cross he nail thi enemi
the law that is against thee and the sin
of all mankind with him there crucifi
never to hurt them more who rightli trust
in thi hi satisfaction; so he die
but soon revives; death over him no power
shall long usurp; ere the third dawn light
return the star of morn shall see him rise
out of hi grave fresh as the dawn light
thi ransom paid which man from death redeem
hi death for man as mani as offer life
neglect not and the benefit embrac
by faith not void of works: thi god-lik act
annul thi doom the death thou shouldest have die
in sin for ever lost from life; thi act
shall bruis the head of satan crush hi strength
defeat sin and death hi two main arms;
and fix far deeper in hi head their sting
than tempor death shall bruis the victor heel
or their whom he redeems; a death like sleep
a gentl waft to immort life
nor after resurrect shall he stay
longer on earth than certain time to appear
to hi discipl men who in hi life
still follow him; to them shall leav in charg
to teach all nation what of him they learn
and hi salvation; them who shall believ
baptiz in the profluent stream the sign
of wash them from guilt of sin to life
pure and in mind prepar if so befal
for death like that which the redeem die
all nation they shall teach; for from that day
not onli to the son of abraham loin
salvat shall be preach but to the son
of abraham faith wherev through the world;
so in hi seed all nation shall be blest
then to the heaven of heaven he shall ascend
with victori triumph through the air
over hi foe and thine; there shall surpris
the serpent princ of air and drag in chain
through all hi realm and there confound leave;
then enter into glori and resum
hi seat at god right hand exalt high
abov all name in heaven; and thenc shall come
when thi world dissolut shall be ripe
with glori and power to judg both quick and dead;
to judg the unfaith dead but to reward
hi faith and receiv them into bliss
whether in heaven or earth; for then the earth
shall all be paradis far happier place
than thi of eden and far happier day
so spake the arch-angel michael; then paus
as at the world great period; and our sire
replet with joy and wonder thu repli
o good infinit good immense!
that all thi good of evil shall produc
and evil turn to good; more wonder
than that which by creation first brought forth
light out of darkness! full of doubt i stand
whether i should repent me now of sin
by me done and occasioned; or rejoic
much more that much more good thereof shall spring;
to god more glori more good-wil to men
from god and over wrath grace shall abound
but say if our deliver up to heaven
must re-ascend what will betid the few
hi faith left among the unfaith herd
the enemi of truth? who then shall guid
hi peopl who defend? will they not deal
wors with hi follow than with him they dealt?
be sure they will said the angel; but from heaven
he to hi own a comfort will send
the promis of the father who shall dwell
hi spirit within them; and the law of faith
work through love upon their heart shall write
to guid them in all truth; and also arm
with spiritu armour abl to resist
satan assault and quench hi fieri darts;
what man can do against them not afraid
though to the death; against such cruelti
with inward consol recompens
and oft support so as shall amaz
their proudest persecutors: for the spirit
pour first on hi apostl whom he send
to evangel the nation then on all
baptiz shall them with wonder gift endu
to speak all tongu and do all miracl
as did their lord befor them thu they win
great number of each nation to receiv
with joy the tide brought from heaven: at length
their ministri perform and race well run
their doctrin and their stori written left
they die; but in their room as they forewarn
wolv shall succeed for teacher grievou wolv
who all the sacr mysteri of heaven
to their own vile advantag shall turn
of lucr and ambition; and the truth
with superstit and tradit taint
left onli in those written record pure
though not but by the spirit understood
then shall they seek to avail themselv of name
place and titl and with these to join
secular power; though feign still to act
by spiritu to themselv appropri
the spirit of god promis alik and given
to all believers; and from that pretenc
spiritu law by carnal power shall forc
on everi conscience; law which none shall find
left them inrol or what the spirit within
shall on the heart engrav what will they then
but forc the spirit of grace itself and bind
hi consort liberty? what but unbuild
hi live templ built by faith to stand
their own faith not anothers? for on earth
who against faith and conscienc can be heard
infallible? yet mani will presume:
whenc heavi persecut shall aris
on all who in the worship persever
of spirit and truth; the rest far greater part
will deem in outward rite and speciou form
religion satisfied; truth shall retir
bestuck with slander dart and work of faith
rare be found: so shall the world go on
to good malign to bad men benign;
under her own weight groaning; till the day
appear of respir to the just
and vengeanc to the wick at return
of him so late promis to thi aid
the woman seed; obscur then foretold
now ampler known thi saviour and thi lord;
last in the cloud from heaven to be reveal
in glori of the father to dissolv
satan with hi pervert world; then rais
from the conflagr mass purg and refin
new heaven new earth age of endless date
found in righteous and peac and love;
to bring forth fruit joy and etern bliss
he ended; and thu adam last repli
how soon hath thi predict seer blest
measur thi transient world the race of time
till time stand fixed! beyond is all abyss
etern whose end no eye can reach
greatly-instruct i shall henc depart;
greatli in peac of thought; and have my fill
of knowledg what thi vessel can contain;
beyond which wa my folli to aspir
henceforth i learn that to obey is best
and love with fear the onli god; to walk
as in hi presence; ever to observ
hi providence; and on him sole depend
merci over all hi work with good
still overcom evil and by small
accomplish great thing by thing deem weak
subvert worldli strong and worldli wise
by simpli meek: that suffer for truth sake
is fortitud to highest victori
and to the faith death the gate of life;
taught thi by hi exampl whom i now

to whom thu also the angel last repli
thi have learn thou hast attain the sum

let us descend now therefor from thi top

whenc thou returnest and whither wentest i know;
for god is also in sleep; and dream advis
which he hath sent propiti some great good
presag sinc with sorrow and heart distress
weari i fell asleep: but now lead on;
in me is no delay; with thee to go
is to stay here; without thee here to stay
is to go henc unwilling; thou to me
art all thing under $heaven all place thou
who for my wil crime art banish henc
thi further consol yet secur
i carri hence; though all by me is lost
such favour i unworthi am vouchsaf
by me the promis seed shall all restor
so spake our mother eve; and adam heard
well pleas but answer not: for now too nigh
the arch-angel stood; and from the other hill
to their fix station all in bright array
the cherubim descended; on the ground
glide meteor as evening-mist
risen from a river oer the marish glide
and gather ground fast at the labour heel
homeward return high in front advanc
the brandish sword of god befor them blaze
fierc as a comet; which with torrid heat
and vapour as the libyan air adust
began to parch that temper clime; whereat
in either hand the hasten angel caught
our linger parent and to the eastern gate
led them direct and down the cliff as fast
to the subject plain; then disappear
they look back all the eastern side beheld
of paradis so late their happi seat
wave over by that flame brand; the gate
with dread face throng and fieri arms:
some natur tear they dropt but wipe them soon;
the world wa all befor them where to choos
their place of rest and provid their guide:
they hand in hand with wander step and slow
through eden took their solitari way
