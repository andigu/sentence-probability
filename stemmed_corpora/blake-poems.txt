[poem by william blake 1789]


song of innoc and of experi
and the book of thel


song of innoc


introduct

pipe down the valley wild
pipe song of pleasant glee
on a cloud i saw a child
and he laugh said to me:

pipe a song about a lamb!
so i pipe with merri cheer
piper pipe that song again;
so i piped: he wept to hear

drop thi pipe thi happi pipe;
sing thi song of happi cheer:!
so i sang the same again
while he wept with joy to hear

piper sit thee down and write
in a book that all may read
so he vanishd from my sight;
and i pluckd a hollow reed

and i made a rural pen
and i staind the water clear
and i wrote my happi song
everi child may joy to hear


the shepherd

how sweet is the shepherd sweet lot!
from the morn to the even he stays;
he shall follow hi sheep all the day
and hi tongu shall be fill with prais

for he hear the lamb innoc call
and he hear the ewe tender reply;
he is watch while they are in peac
for they know when their shepherd is nigh


the echo green

the sun doe aris
and make happi the skies;
the merri bell ring
to welcom the spring;
the skylark and thrush
the bird of the bush
sing louder around
to the bell cheer sound;
while our sport shall be seen
on the echo green

old john with white hair
doe laugh away care
sit under the oak
among the old folk
they laugh at our play
and soon they all say
such such were the joy
when we all -- girl and boy --
in our youth-tim were seen
on the echo green

till the littl one weari
no more can be merry:
the sun doe descend
and our sport have an end
round the lap of their mother
mani sister and brother
like bird in their nest
are readi for rest
and sport no more seen
on the darken green


the lamb

littl lamb who make thee
dost thou know who made thee
gave thee life and bid thee feed
by the stream and oer the mead;
gave thee cloth of delight
softest cloth wolli bright;
gave thee such a tender voic
make all the vale rejoice?
littl lamb who made thee?
dost thou know who made thee?

littl lamb ill tell thee;
littl lamb ill tell thee:
he is call by thi name
for he call himself a lamb
he is meek and he is mild
he becam a littl child
i a child and thou a lamb
we are call by hi name
littl lamb god bless thee!
littl lamb god bless thee!


the littl black boy

my mother bore me in the southern wild
and i am black but oh my soul is white!
white as an angel is the english child
but i am black as if bereav of light

my mother taught me underneath a tree
and sit down befor the heat of day
she took me on her lap and kiss me
and point to the east began to say:

look on the rise sun: there god doe live
and give hi light and give hi heat away
and flower and tree and beast and men receiv
comfort in morn joy in the noonday

and we are put on earth a littl space
that we may learn to bear the beam of love
and these black bodi and thi sunburnt face
is but a cloud and like a shadi grove

for when our soul have learnd the heat to bear
the cloud will vanish we shall hear hi voic
say come out from the grove my love and care
and round my golden tent like lamb rejoic

thu did my mother say and kiss me;
and thu i say to littl english boy
when i from black and he from white cloud free
and round the tent of god like lamb we joy

ill shade him from the heat till he can bear
to lean in joy upon our father knee;
and then ill stand and stroke hi silver hair
and be like him and he will then love me


the blossom

merri merri sparrow!
under leav so green
a happi blossom
see you swift as arrow
seek your cradl narrow
near my bosom
pretti pretti robin!
under leav so green
a happi blossom
hear you sob sob
pretti pretti robin
near my bosom


the chimney-sweep

when my mother die i wa veri young
and my father sold me while yet my tongu
could scarc cri weep! weep! weep! weep!
so your chimney i sweep and in soot i sleep

there littl tom dacr who cri when hi head
that curl like a lamb back wa shaved; so i said
hush tom! never mind it for when your head bare
you know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair

and so he wa quiet and that veri night
as tom wa a-sleep he had such a sight! --
that thousand of sweeper dick joe ned and jack
were all of them lock up in coffin of black

and by came an angel who had a bright key
and he open the coffin and let them all free;
then down a green plain leap laugh they run
and wash in a river and shine in the sun

then nake and white all their bag left behind
they rise upon cloud and sport in the wind;
and the angel told tom if hed be a good boy
hed have god for hi father and never want joy

and so tom awok and we rose in the dark
and got with our bag and our brush to work
though the morn wa cold tom wa happi and warm:
so if all do their duti they need not fear harm


the littl boy lost

father father where are you going?
oh do not walk so fast!
speak father speak to you littl boy
or els i shall be lost

the night wa dark no father wa there
the child wa wet with dew;
the mire wa deep and the child did weep
and away the vapour flew


the littl boy found

the littl boy lost in the lone fen
led by the wander light
began to cri but god ever nigh
appear like hi father in white

he kiss the child and by the hand led
and to hi mother brought
who in sorrow pale through the lone dale
the littl boy weep sought


laugh song

when the green wood laugh with the voic of joy
and the dimpl stream run laugh by;
when the air doe laugh with our merri wit
and the green hill laugh with the nois of it;

when the meadow laugh with live green
and the grasshopp laugh in the merri scene
when mari and susan and emili
with their sweet round mouth sing ha ha he!

when the paint bird laugh in the shade
where our tabl with cherri and nut is spread:
come live and be merri and join with me
to sing the sweet choru of ha ha he!

holi thursday

twa on a holi thursday their innoc face clean
came children walk two and two in read and blue and green:
grey-head beadl walk befor with wand as white as snow
till into the high dome of paul they like thame water flow

oh what a multitud they seem these flower of london town!
seat in compani they sit with radianc all their own
the hum of multitud wa there but multitud of lamb
thousand of littl boy and girl rais their innoc hand

now like a mighti wild they rais to heaven the voic of song
or like harmoni thunder the seat of heaven among:
beneath them sit the age man wise guardian of the poor
then cherish piti lest you drive an angel from your door


night

the sun descend in the west
the even star doe shine;
the bird are silent in their nest
and i must seek for mine
the moon like a flower
in heaven high bower
with silent delight
sit and smile on the night

farewel green field and happi grove
where flock have taen delight
where lamb have nibbl silent move
the feet of angel bright;
unseen they pour bless
and joy without ceas
on each bud and blossom
and each sleep bosom

they look in everi thoughtless nest
where bird are cover warm;
they visit cave of everi beast
to keep them all from harm:
if they see ani weep
that should have been sleep
they pour sleep on their head
and sit down by their bed

when wolv and tiger howl for prey
they piti stand and weep;
seek to drive their thirst away
and keep them from the sheep
but if they rush dread
the angel most heed
receiv each mild spirit
new world to inherit


and there the lion ruddi eye
shall flow with tear of gold:
and piti the tender cri
and walk round the fold:
saying: wrath by hi meek
and by hi health sick
are driven away
from our immort day

and now besid thee bleat lamb
i can lie down and sleep
or think on him who bore thi name
graze after thee and weep
for wash in life river
my bright mane for ever
shall shine like the gold
as i guard oer the fold


spring

sound the flute!
now it mute!
bird delight
day and night
nightingal

lark in sky--

merrili merrili to welcom in the year

littl boy

littl girl
sweet and small;
cock doe crow
so do you;
merri voic
infant noise;
merrili merrili to welcom in the year

littl lamb
here i am;
come and lick
my white neck;
let me pull
your soft wool;
let me kiss
your soft face;
merrili merrili to welcom in the year


nurs song

when the voic of children are heard on the green
and laugh is heard on the hill
my heart is at rest within my breast
and everyth els is still
then come home my children the sun is gone down
and the dew of night arise;
come come leav off play and let us away
till the morn appear in the sky

no no let us play for it is yet day
and we cannot go to sleep;
besid in the sky the littl bird fli
and the hill are all cover with sheep
well well go and play till the light fade away
and then go home to bed
the littl one leap and shout and laugh
and all the hill echo


infant joy

i have no name;
i am but two day old
what shall i call thee?
i happi am
joy is my name
sweet joy befal thee!

pretti joy!
sweet joy but two day old
sweet joy i call thee:
thou dost smile
i sing the while;
sweet joy befal thee!


a dream

onc a dream did weav a shade
oer my angel-guard bed
that an emmet lost it way
where on grass methought i lay

troubl wilder and forlorn
dark benight travel-worn
over mani a tangl spray
all heart-brok i heard her say:

oh my children! do they cri
do they hear their father sigh?
now they look abroad to see
now return and weep for me

piti i drop a tear:
but i saw a glow-worm near
who repli what wail wight
call the watchman of the night?

i am set to light the ground
while the beetl goe hi round:
follow now the beetl hum;
littl wander hie thee home!


on anoth sorrow

can i see anoth woe
and not be in sorrow too?
can i see anoth grief
and not seek for kind relief?

can i see a fall tear
and not feel my sorrow share?
can a father see hi child
weep nor be with sorrow filled?

can a mother sit and hear
an infant groan an infant fear?
no no! never can it be!
never never can it be!

and can he who smile on all
hear the wren with sorrow small
hear the small bird grief and care
hear the woe that infant bear --

and not sit besid the next
pour piti in their breast
and not sit the cradl near
weep tear on infant tear?

and not sit both night and day
wipe all our tear away?
oh no! never can it be!
never never can it be!

he doth give hi joy to all:
he becom an infant small
he becom a man of woe
he doth feel the sorrow too

think not thou canst sigh a sigh
and thi maker is not by:
think not thou canst weep a tear
and thi maker is not year

oh he give to us hi joy
that our grief he may destroy:
till our grief is fled an gone
he doth sit by us and moan


song of experi


introduct

hear the voic of the bard
who present past and futur sees;
whose ear have heard
the holi word
that walk among the ancient tree;

call the laps soul
and weep in the even dew;
that might control
the starri pole
and fallen fallen light renew!

o earth o earth return!
aris from out the dewi grass!
night is worn
and the morn
rise from the slumbrou mass

turn away no more;
whi wilt thou turn away?
the starri floor
the wateri shore
are given thee till the break of day


earth answer

earth rais up her head
from the dark dread and drear
her light fled
stoni dread
and her lock cover with grey despair

prison on wateri shore
starri jealousi doe keep my den
cold and hoar;
weep ore
i hear the father of the ancient men

selfish father of men!
cruel jealou selfish fear!
can delight
chain in night
the virgin of youth and morn bear?


doe spring hide it joy
when bud and blossom grow?
doe the sower
sow by night
or the plowman in dark plough?

break thi heavi chain
that doe freez my bone around!
selfish vain
etern bane
that free love with bondag bound


the clod and the pebbl

love seeketh not itself to pleas
nor for itself hath ani care
but for anoth give it eas
and build a heaven in hell despair

so sang a littl clod of clay
trodden with the cattl feet
but a pebbl of the brook
warbl out these metr meet:

love seeketh onli self to pleas
to bind anoth to it delight
joy in anoth loss of eas
and build a hell in heaven despit


holi thursday

is thi a holi thing to see
in a rich and fruit land --
babe reduc to miseri
fed with cold and usur hand?

is that trembl cri a song?
can it be a song of joy?
and so mani children poor?
it is a land of poverty!

and their son doe never shine
and their field are bleak and bare
and their way are fill with thorns:
it is etern winter there

for whereer the sun doe shine
and whereer the rain doe fall
babe should never hunger there
nor poverti the mind appal


the littl girl lost

in futur
i prophet see
that the earth from sleep
(grave the sentenc deep)

shall aris and seek
for her maker meek;
and the desert wild
becom a garden mild

in the southern clime
where the summer prime
never fade away
love lyca lay

seven summer old
love lyca told
she had wander long
hear wild bird song

sweet sleep come to me
underneath thi tree;
do father mother weep?
where can lyca sleep?

lost in desert wild
is your littl child
how can lyca sleep
if her mother weep?

if her heart doe ach
then let lyca wake;
if my mother sleep
lyca shall not weep

frown frown night
oer thi desert bright
let thi moon aris
while i close my eye

sleep lyca lay
while the beast of prey
come from cavern deep
view the maid asleep

the kingli lion stood
and the virgin viewed:
then he gambol round
oer the hallow ground

leopard tiger play
round her as she lay;
while the lion old
bow hi mane of gold

and her breast did lick
and upon her neck
from hi eye of flame
rubi tear there came;

while the lioness
loos her slender dress
and nake they convey
to cave the sleep maid


the littl girl found

all the night in woe
lyca parent go
over valley deep
while the desert weep

tire and woe-begon
hoars with make moan
arm in arm seven day
they trace the desert way

seven night they sleep
among shadow deep
and dream they see their child
starv in desert wild

pale through pathless way
the fanci imag stray
famish weep weak
with hollow piteou shriek

rise from unrest
the trembl woman press
with feet of weari woe;
she could no further go

in hi arm he bore
her arm with sorrow sore;
till befor their way
a couch lion lay

turn back wa vain:
soon hi heavi mane
bore them to the ground
then he stalk around

smell to hi prey;
but their fear allay
when he lick their hand
and silent by them stand

they look upon hi eye
fill with deep surprise;
and wonder behold
a spirit arm in gold

on hi head a crown
on hi shoulder down
flow hi golden hair
gone wa all their care

follow me he said;
weep not for the maid;
in my palac deep
lyca lie asleep

then they follow
where the vision led
and saw their sleep child
among tiger wild

to thi day they dwell
in a lone dell
nor fear the wolvish howl
nor the lion growl


the chimney sweeper

a littl black thing in the snow
cri weep! weep! in note of woe!
where are thi father and mother? say!--
they are both gone up to the church to pray

becaus i wa happi upon the heath
and smile among the winter snow
they cloth me in the cloth of death
and taught me to sing the note of woe

and becaus i am happi and danc and sing
they think they have done me no injuri
and are gone to prais god and hi priest and king
who make up a heaven of our miseri


nurs song

when voic of children are heard on the green
and whisper are in the dale
the day of my youth rise fresh in my mind
my face turn green and pale

then come home my children the sun is gone down
and the dew of night arise;
your spring and your day are wast in play
and your winter and night in disguis


the sick rose

o rose thou art sick!
the invis worm
that fli in the night
in the howl storm

ha found out thi bed
of crimson joy
and hi dark secret love
doe thi life destroy


the fli

littl fli
thi summer play
my thoughtless hand
ha brush away

am not i
a fli like thee?
or art not thou
a man like me?

for i danc
and drink and sing
till some blind hand
shall brush my wing

if thought is life
and strength and breath
and the want
of thought is death;

then am i
a happi fli
if i live
or if i die


the angel

i dreamt a dream! what can it mean?
and that i wa a maiden queen
guard by an angel mild:
witless woe wa neer beguiled!

and i wept both night and day
and he wipe my tear away;
and i wept both day and night
and hid from him my heart delight

so he took hi wing and fled;
then the morn blush rosi red
i dri my tear and arm my fear
with ten-thousand shield and spear

soon my angel came again;
i wa arm he came in vain;
for the time of youth wa fled
and grey hair were on my head


the tiger

tiger tiger burn bright
in the forest of the night
what immort hand or eye
could frame thi fear symmetry?

in what distant deep or sky
burnt the fire of thine eyes?
on what wing dare he aspire?
what the hand dare seiz the fire?

and what shoulder and what art
could twist the sinew of thi heart?
and when thi heart began to beat
what dread hand and what dread feet?

what the hammer? what the chain?
in what furnac wa thi brain?
what the anvil? what dread grasp
dare it deadli terror clasp?

when the star threw down their spear
and water heaven with their tear
did he smile hi work to see?
did he who made the lamb make thee?

tiger tiger burn bright
in the forest of the night
what immort hand or eye
dare frame thi fear symmetry?


my pretti rose tree

a flower wa offer to me
such a flower as may never bore;
but i said ive a pretti rose tree
and i pass the sweet flower oer

then i went to my pretti rose tree
to tend her by day and by night;
but my rose turn away with jealousi
and her thorn were my onli delight


ah sunflow

ah sunflow weari of time
who countest the step of the sun;
seek after that sweet golden clime
where the travel journey is done;

where the youth pine away with desir
and the pale virgin shroud in snow
aris from their grave and aspir
where my sunflow wish to go!


the lili

the modest rose put forth a thorn
the humbl sheep a threatn horn:
while the lili white shall in love delight
nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauti bright


the garden of love

i laid me down upon a bank
where love lay sleeping;
i heard among the rush dank
weep weep

then i went to the heath and the wild
to the thistl and thorn of the waste;
and they told me how they were beguil
driven out and compel to the chast

i went to the garden of love
and saw what i never had seen;
a chapel wa built in the midst
where i use to play on the green

and the gate of thi chapel were shut
and thou shalt not writ over the door;
so i turn to the garden of love
that so mani sweet flower bore

and i saw it wa fill with grave
and tombston where flower should be;
and priest in black gown were walk their round
and bind with briar my joy and desir


the littl vagabond

dear mother dear mother the church is cold;
but the alehous is healthi and pleasant and warm
besid i can tell where i am use well;
the poor parson with wind like a blown bladder swell

but if at the church they would give us some ale
and a pleasant fire our soul to regal
wed sing and wed pray all the livelong day
nor ever onc wish from the church to stray

then the parson might preach and drink and sing
and wed be as happi as bird in the spring;
and modest dame lurch who is alway at church
would not have bandi children nor fast nor birch

and god like a father rejoic to see
hi children as pleasant and happi as he
would have no more quarrel with the devil or the barrel
but kiss him and give him both drink and apparel


london

i wander through each charter street
near where the charter thame doe flow
a mark in everi face i meet
mark of weak mark of woe

in everi cri of everi man
in everi infant cri of fear
in everi voic in everi ban
the mind-forg manacl i hear:

how the chimney-sweep cri
everi blacken church appal
and the hapless soldier sigh
run in blood down palace-wal

but most through midnight street i hear
how the youth harlot curs
blast the new-born infant tear
and blight with plagu the marriage-hears


the human abstract

piti would be no more
if we did not make somebodi poor
and merci no more could be
if all were as happi as we

and mutual fear bring peac
till the selfish love increas
then cruelti knit a snare
and spread hi bait with care

he sit down with hi holi fear
and water the ground with tears;
then humil take it root
underneath hi foot

soon spread the dismal shade
of mysteri over hi head
and the caterpillar and fli
feed on the mysteri

and it bear the fruit of deceit
ruddi and sweet to eat
and the raven hi nest ha made
in it thickest shade

the god of the earth and sea
sought through natur to find thi tree
but their search wa all in vain:
there grow one in the human brain


infant sorrow

my mother groan my father wept:
into the danger world i leapt
helpless nake pipe loud
like a fiend hid in a cloud

struggl in my father hand
strive against my swaddling-band
bound and weari i thought best
to sulk upon my mother breast


a poison tree

i wa angri with my friend:
i told my wrath my wrath did end
i wa angri with my foe:
i told it not my wrath did grow

and i water it in fear
night and morn with my tear
and i sun it with smile
and with soft deceit wile

and it grew both day and night
till it bore an appl bright
and my foe beheld it shine
and he knew that it wa mine --

and into my garden stole
when the night had veil the pole;
in the morn glad i see
my foe outstretch beneath the tree


a littl boy lost

nought love anoth as itself
nor vener anoth so
nor is it possibl to thought
a greater than itself to know

and father how can i love you
or ani of my brother more?
i love you like the littl bird
that pick up crumb around the door

the priest sat by and heard the child;
in trembl zeal he seiz hi hair
he led him by hi littl coat
and all admir the priestli care

and stand on the altar high
lo what a fiend is here! said he:
one who set reason up for judg
of our most holi mysteri

the weep child could not be heard
the weep parent wept in vain:
they strip him to hi littl shirt
and bound him in an iron chain

and burn him in a holi place
where mani had been burn before;
the weep parent wept in vain
are such thing done on albion shore?


a littl girl lost

children of the futur age
read thi indign page
know that in a former time
love sweet love wa thought a crime

in the age of gold
free from winter cold
youth and maiden bright
to the holi light
nake in the sunni beam delight

onc a youth pair
fill with softest care
met in garden bright
where the holi light
had just remov the curtain of the night

then in rise day
on the grass they play;
parent were afar
stranger came not near
and the maiden soon forgot her fear

tire with kiss sweet
they agre to meet
when the silent sleep
wave oer heaven deep
and the weari tire wander weep

to her father white
came the maiden bright;
but hi love look
like the holi book
all her tender limb with terror shook

ona pale and weak
to thi father speak!
oh the trembl fear!
oh the dismal care
that shake the blossom of my hoari hair!


the schoolboy

i love to rise on a summer morn
when bird are sing on everi tree;
the distant huntsman wind hi horn
and the skylark sing with me:
oh what sweet company!

but to go to school in a summer morn --
oh it drive all joy away!
under a cruel eye outworn
the littl one spend the day
in sigh and dismay

ah then at time i droop sit
and spend mani an anxiou hour;
nor in my book can i take delight
nor sit in learn bower
worn through with the dreari shower

how can the bird that is born for joy
sit in a cage and sing?
how can a child when fear annoy
but droop hi tender wing
and forget hi youth spring?

oh father and mother if bud are nip
and blossom blown away;
and if the tender plant are strip
of their joy in the spring day
by sorrow and care dismay --

how shall the summer aris in joy
or the summer fruit appear?
or how shall we gather what grief destroy
or bless the mellow year
when the blast of winter appear?


to terzah

whateer is born of mortal birth
must be consum with the earth
to rise from gener free:
then what have i to do with thee?
the sex sprang from shame and pride
blown in the morn in even died;
but merci chang death into sleep;
the sex rose to work and weep

thou mother of my mortal part
with cruelti didst mould my heart
and with fals self-deceiv tear
didst bind my nostril eye and ear

didst close my tongu in senseless clay
and me to mortal life betray
the death of jesu set me free:
then what have i to do with thee?


the voic of the ancient bard

youth of delight! come hither
and see the open morn
imag of truth new-born
doubt is fled and cloud of reason
dark disput and art teaz
folli is an endless maze;
tangl root perplex her ways;
how mani have fallen there!
they stumbl all night over bone of the dead;
and feel -- they know not what but care;
and wish to lead other when they should be led


appendix

the daughter of mne seraphim led round their sunni flock
all but the youngest: she in pale sought the secret air
to fade away like morn beauti from her mortal day:
down by the river of adona her soft voic is heard;
and thu her gentl lament fall like morn dew

o life of thi our spring! whi fade the lotu of the water?
whi fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall
ah! thel is like a watri bow and like a part cloud
like a reflect in a glass: like shadow in the water
like dream of infant like a smile upon an infant face
like the dove voic like transient day like music in the air:
ah! gentl may i lay me down and gentl rest my head
and gentl sleep the sleep of death and gentli hear the voic
of him that walketh in the garden in the even time

the lilli of the valley breath in the humbl grass
answerd the love maid and said: i am a watri weed
and i am veri small and love to dwell in lowli vales:
so weak the gild butterfli scarc perch on my head
yet i am visit from heaven and he that smile on all
walk in the valley and each morn over me spread hi hand
say rejoic thou humbl grass thou new-born lili flower
thou gentl maid of silent valley and of modest brooks:
for thou shall be cloth in light and fed with morn manna:
till summer heat melt thee besid the fountain and the spring
to flourish in etern vales: they whi should thel complain
whi should the mistress of the vale of har utter a sigh

she ceasd & smild in tear then sat down in her silver shrine

thel answerd o thou littl virgin of the peac valley
give to those that cannot crave the voiceless the oer tire
the breath doth nourish the innoc lamb he smell the milki garment
he crop thi flower while thou sittest smile in hi face
wipe hi mild and meekin mouth from all contagi taint
thi wine doth purifi the golden honey; thi perfum
which thou dost scatter on everi littl blade of grass that spring
reviv the milk cow & tame the fire-breath steed
but thel is like a faint cloud kindl at the rise sun:
i vanish from my pearli throne and who shall find my place

queen of the vale the lili answer ask the tender cloud
and it shall tell thee whi it glitter in the morn sky
and whi it scatter it bright beauti thro the humid air
descend o littl cloud & hover befor the eye of thel

the cloud descend and the lili bowd her modest head:
and went to mind her numer charg among the verdant grass


ii

o littl cloud the virgin said i charg thee to tell me
whi thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away:
then we shall seek thee but not find: ah thel is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hear my voic

the cloud then shewd hi golden head & hi bright form emergd
hover and glitter on the air befor the face of thel

o virgin knowst thou not our steed drink of the golden spring
where luvah doth renew hi horses: lookst thou on my youth
and fearest thou becaus i vanish and am seen no more
noth remains; o maid i tell thee when i pass away
it is to tenfold life to love to peac and raptur holy:
unseen descend weigh my light wing upon balmi flowers:
and court the fair eye dew to take me to her shine tent
the weep virgin trembl kneel befor the risen sun
till we aris linkd in a golden band and never part:
but walk unit bear food to all our tender flower

dost thou o littl cloud? i fear that i am not like thee:
for i walk through the vale of har and smell the sweetest flowers:
but i feed not the littl flowers: i hear the warbl bird
but i feed not the warbl bird they fli and seek their food:
but thel delight in these no more becaus i fade away
and all shall say without a use thi shine women livd
or did she onli live to be at death the food of worm

the cloud reclind upon hi airi throne and answerd thu

then if thou art the food of worm o virgin of the sky
how great thi use how great thi bless everi thing that live
live not alon nor or itself: fear not and i will call
the weak worm from it lowli bed and thou shalt hear it voic
come forth worm and the silent valley to thi pensiv queen

the helpless worm aros and sat upon the lilli leaf
and the bright cloud saild on to find hi partner in the vale


iii

then thel astonishd viewd the worm upon it dewi bed

art thou a worm? imag of weak art thou but a worm?
i see thee like an infant wrap in the lilli leaf;
ah weep not littl voic thou canst not speak but thou canst weep:
is thi a worm? i see they lay helpless & naked: weep
and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother smile

the clod of clay heard the worm voic & raisd her piti head:
she bowd over the weep infant and her life exhald
in milki fond then on thel she fixd her humbl eye

o beauti of the vale of har we live not for ourselv
thou seest me the meanest thing and so i am indeed:
my bosom of itself is cold and of itself is dark

but he that love the lowli pour hi oil upon my head
and kiss me and bind hi nuptial band around my breast
and says; thou mother of my children i have love thee
and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
but how thi is sweet maid i know not and i cannot know
i ponder and i cannot ponder; yet i live and love

the daughter of beauti wipd her piti tear with her white veil
and said alas! i knew not thi and therefor did i weep:
that god would love a worm i knew and punish the evil foot
that wil bruisd it helpless form: but that he cherishd it
with milk and oil i never knew and therefor did i weep
and i complaind in the mild air becaus i fade away
and lay me down in thi cold bed and leav my shine lot

queen of the vale the matron clay answered: i heard thi sigh
and all thi moan flew oer my roof but i have calld them down:
wilt thou o queen enter my hous ti given thee to enter
and to return: fear noth enter with thi virgin feet


iv

the etern gate terrif porter lift the northern bar:
thel enterd in & saw the secret of the land unknown;
she saw the couch of the dead & where the fibrou root
of everi heart on earth infix deep it restless twists:
a land of sorrow & of tear where never smile wa seen

she wander in the land of cloud thro valley dark listn
dolor & lamentations: wait oft besid the dewi grave
she stood in silenc listn to the voic of the ground
till to her own grave plot she came & there she sat down
and heard thi voic of sorrow breath from the hollow pit

whi cannot the ear be close to it own destruction?
or the glisten eye to the poison of a smile!
whi are eyelid stord with arrow readi drawn
where a thousand fight men in ambush lie!
or an eye of gift & grace showr fruit & coin gold!

whi a tongu impressd with honey from everi wind?
whi an ear a whirlpool fierc to draw creation in?
whi a nostril wide inhal terror trembl & affright
whi a tender curb upon the youth burn boy?
whi a littl curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?

the virgin start from her seat & with a shriek
fled back unhinderd till she came into the vale of har
