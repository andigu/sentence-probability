chapter 1


sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshir wa a man who
for hi own amus never took up ani book but the baronetage;
there he found occup for an idl hour and consol in a
distress one; there hi faculti were rous into admir and
respect by contempl the limit remnant of the earliest patents;
there ani unwelcom sensat aris from domest affair
chang natur into piti and contempt as he turn over
the almost endless creation of the last century; and there
if everi other leaf were powerless he could read hi own histori
with an interest which never fail thi wa the page at which
the favourit volum alway opened:

elliot of kellynch hall

walter elliot born march 1 1760 marri juli 15 1784 elizabeth
daughter of jame stevenson esq of south park in the counti of
gloucest by which ladi (who die 1800) he ha issu elizabeth
born june 1 1785; ann born august 9 1787; a still-born son
novemb 5 1789; mari born novemb 20 1791

precis such had the paragraph origin stood from the printer hands;
but sir walter had improv it by ad for the inform of
himself and hi famili these word after the date of mari birth--
marri decemb 16 1810 charl son and heir of charl
musgrov esq of uppercross in the counti of somerset
and by insert most accur the day of the month on which
he had lost hi wife

then follow the histori and rise of the ancient and respect famili
in the usual terms; how it had been first settl in cheshire;
how mention in dugdal serv the offic of high sheriff

of charl ii with all the mari and elizabeth they had married;
form altogeth two handsom duodecimo page and conclud with
the arm and motto:--princip seat kellynch hall in the counti
of somerset and sir walter handwrit again in thi finale:--

heir presumpt william walter elliot esq great grandson of
the second sir walter

vaniti wa the begin and the end of sir walter elliot character;
vaniti of person and of situat he had been remark handsom
in hi youth; and at fifty-four wa still a veri fine man
few women could think more of their person appear than he did
nor could the valet of ani new made lord be more delight with
the place he held in societi he consid the bless of beauti
as inferior onli to the bless of a baronetcy; and the sir walter elliot
who unit these gift wa the constant object of hi warmest respect
and devot

hi good look and hi rank had one fair claim on hi attachment;
sinc to them he must have owe a wife of veri superior charact
to ani thing deserv by hi own ladi elliot had been an excel woman
sensibl and amiable; whose judgement and conduct if they might be
pardon the youth infatu which made her ladi elliot
had never requir indulg afterwards--sh had humour
or soften or conceal hi fail and promot hi real
respect for seventeen years; and though not the veri happiest
be in the world herself had found enough in her duti her friend
and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of
indiffer to her when she wa call on to quit them
--three girl the two eldest sixteen and fourteen wa an aw legaci
for a mother to bequeath an aw charg rather to confid to
the author and guidanc of a conceit silli father
she had howev one veri intim friend a sensibl deserv woman
who had been brought by strong attach to herself to settl
close by her in the villag of kellynch; and on her kind and advic
ladi elliot mainli reli for the best help and mainten of
the good principl and instruct which she had been anxious
give her daughter

thi friend and sir walter did not marri whatev might have been
anticip on that head by their acquaint thirteen year
had pass away sinc ladi elliot death and they were still
near neighbour and intim friend and one remain a widow
the other a widow

that ladi russel of steadi age and charact and extrem
well provid for should have no thought of a second marriag
need no apolog to the public which is rather apt to be unreason
discont when a woman doe marri again than when she doe not;
but sir walter continu in singl requir explan
be it known then that sir walter like a good father (have met with
one or two privat disappoint in veri unreason applications)
pride himself on remain singl for hi dear daughter sake
for one daughter hi eldest he would realli have given up ani thing
which he had not been veri much tempt to do elizabeth had succeed
at sixteen to all that wa possibl of her mother right
and consequence; and be veri handsom and veri like himself
her influenc had alway been great and they had gone on togeth
most happili hi two other children were of veri inferior valu
mari had acquir a littl artifici import by becom
mr charl musgrove; but ann with an eleg of mind and sweet
of charact which must have place her high with ani peopl
of real understand wa nobodi with either father or sister;
her word had no weight her conveni wa alway to give way--
she wa onli ann

to ladi russel inde she wa a most dear and highli valu
god-daught favourit and friend ladi russel love them all;
but it wa onli in ann that she could fanci the mother to reviv again

a few year befor ann elliot had been a veri pretti girl
but her bloom had vanish early; and as even in it height
her father had found littl to admir in her (so total differ
were her delic featur and mild dark eye from hi own)
there could be noth in them now that she wa fade and thin
to excit hi esteem he had never indulg much hope he had now none
of ever read her name in ani other page of hi favourit work
all equal of allianc must rest with elizabeth for mari had mere
connect herself with an old countri famili of respect and
larg fortun and had therefor given all the honour and receiv none:
elizabeth would one day or other marri suitabl

it sometim happen that a woman is handsom at twenty-nin than
she wa ten year before; and gener speak if there ha been
neither ill health nor anxieti it is a time of life at which scarc ani
charm is lost it wa so with elizabeth still the same handsom
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen year ago and sir walter
might be excus therefor in forget her age or at least
be deem onli half a fool for think himself and elizabeth
as bloom as ever amidst the wreck of the good look of everybodi else;
for he could plainli see how old all the rest of hi famili and
acquaint were grow ann haggard mari coars everi face
in the neighbourhood worst and the rapid increas of the crow foot
about ladi russel templ had long been a distress to him

elizabeth did not quit equal her father in person content
thirteen year had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presid and
direct with a self-possess and decis which could never have given
the idea of her be younger than she wa for thirteen year had
she been do the honour and lay down the domest law at home
and lead the way to the chais and four and walk immedi after
ladi russel out of all the drawing-room and dining-room in the countri
thirteen winter revolv frost had seen her open everi ball
of credit which a scanti neighbourhood afford and thirteen spring
shewn their blossom as she travel up to london with her father
for a few week annual enjoy of the great world she had
the remembr of all thi she had the conscious of be
nine-and-twenti to give her some regret and some apprehensions;
she wa fulli satisfi of be still quit as handsom as ever
but she felt her approach to the year of danger and would have rejoic
to be certain of be properli solicit by baronet-blood within
the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up
the book of book with as much enjoy as in her earli youth
but now she like it not alway to be present with the date of
her own birth and see no marriag follow but that of a youngest sister
made the book an evil; and more than onc when her father had left it
open on the tabl near her had she close it with avert eye
and push it away

she had had a disappoint moreov which that book
and especi the histori of her own famili must ever present
the remembr of the heir presumpt the veri william walter
elliot esq whose right had been so gener support
by her father had disappoint her

she had while a veri young girl as soon as she had known him to be
in the event of her have no brother the futur baronet
meant to marri him and her father had alway meant that she should
he had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after ladi elliot death
sir walter had sought the acquaint and though hi overtur
had not been met with ani warmth he had persev in seek it
make allow for the modest drawing-back of youth; and in one of
their spring excurs to london when elizabeth wa in her first bloom
mr elliot had been forc into the introduct

he wa at that time a veri young man just engag in the studi of the law;
and elizabeth found him extrem agreeabl and everi plan in hi favour
wa confirm he wa invit to kellynch hall; he wa talk of
and expect all the rest of the year; but he never came
the follow spring he wa seen again in town found equal agreeabl
again encourag invit and expect and again he did not come;
and the next tide were that he wa marri instead of push
hi fortun in the line mark out for the heir of the hous of elliot
he had purchas independ by unit himself to a rich woman
of inferior birth

sir walter ha resent it as the head of the hous he felt that
he ought to have been consult especi after take the young man
so publicli by the hand; for they must have been seen togeth
he observ onc at tattersal and twice in the lobbi of
the hous of common hi disapprob wa express
but appar veri littl regard mr elliot had attempt no apolog
and shewn himself as unsolicit of be longer notic by the famili
as sir walter consid him unworthi of it: all acquaint between
them had ceas

thi veri awkward histori of mr elliot wa still after an interv
of sever year felt with anger by elizabeth who had like the man
for himself and still more for be her father heir and whose
strong famili pride could see onli in him a proper match for sir walter
elliot eldest daughter there wa not a baronet from a to z whom
her feel could have so willingli acknowledg as an equal
yet so miser had he conduct himself that though she wa
at thi present time (the summer of 1814) wear black ribbon
for hi wife she could not admit him to be worth think of again
the disgrac of hi first marriag might perhap as there wa
no reason to suppos it perpetu by offspr have been got over
had he not done worse; but he had as by the accustomari intervent
of kind friend they had been inform spoken most disrespect
of them all most slightingli and contemptu of the veri blood
he belong to and the honour which were hereaft to be hi own
thi could not be pardon

such were elizabeth elliot sentiment and sensations; such the care
to alloy the agit to vari the same and the eleg
the prosper and the nothing of her scene of life;
such the feel to give interest to a long unev resid
in one countri circl to fill the vacanc which there were no habit
of util abroad no talent or accomplish for home to occupi

but now anoth occup and solicitud of mind wa begin to be
ad to these her father wa grow distress for money
she knew that when he now took up the baronetag it wa to drive
the heavi bill of hi tradespeopl and the unwelcom hint of
mr shepherd hi agent from hi thought the kellynch properti wa good
but not equal to sir walter apprehens of the state requir
in it possessor while ladi elliot live there had been method
moder and economi which had just kept him within hi income;
but with her had die all such right-minded and from that period
he had been constantli exceed it it had not been possibl
for him to spend less; he had done noth but what sir walter elliot
wa imperi call on to do; but blameless as he wa he wa
not onli grow dread in debt but wa hear of it so often
that it becam vain to attempt conceal it longer even partial
from hi daughter he had given her some hint of it the last spring
in town; he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench?
doe it occur to you that there is ani one articl in which
we can retrench? and elizabeth to do her justic had in the first
ardour of femal alarm set serious to think what could be done
and had final propos these two branch of economi to cut off
some unnecessari chariti and to refrain from new furnish
the drawing-room; to which expedi she afterward ad
the happi thought of their take no present down to ann
as had been the usual yearli custom but these measur
howev good in themselv were insuffici for the real extent
of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself oblig
to confess to her soon afterward elizabeth had noth to propos
of deeper efficaci she felt herself ill-us and unfortun
as did her father; and they were neither of them abl to devis
ani mean of lessen their expens without compromis their digniti
or relinquish their comfort in a way not to be born

there wa onli a small part of hi estat that sir walter could dispos of;
but had everi acr been alien it would have made no differ
he had condescend to mortgag as far as he had the power
but he would never condescend to sell no; he would never disgrac
hi name so far the kellynch estat should be transmit whole
and entir as he had receiv it

their two confidenti friend mr shepherd who live in
the neighbour market town and ladi russel were call to advis them;
and both father and daughter seem to expect that someth should be
struck out by one or the other to remov their embarrass
and reduc their expenditur without involv the loss of
ani indulg of tast or pride



chapter 2


mr shepherd a civil cautiou lawyer who whatev might be hi hold
or hi view on sir walter would rather have the disagre
prompt by anybodi els excus himself from offer the slightest hint
and onli beg leav to recommend an implicit refer to
the excel judgement of ladi russel from whose known good sens
he fulli expect to have just such resolut measur advis as
he meant to see final adopt

ladi russel wa most anxious zealou on the subject and gave it
much seriou consider she wa a woman rather of sound than of
quick abil whose difficulti in come to ani decis
in thi instanc were great from the opposit of two lead principl
she wa of strict integr herself with a delic sens of honour;
but she wa as desir of save sir walter feel as solicit
for the credit of the famili as aristocrat in her idea of what
wa due to them as anybodi of sens and honesti could well be
she wa a benevol charit good woman and capabl of
strong attach most correct in her conduct strict in her notion
of decorum and with manner that were held a standard of good-breed
she had a cultiv mind and wa gener speak
ration and consistent; but she had prejudic on the side of ancestry;
she had a valu for rank and consequ which blind her a littl
to the fault of those who possess them herself the widow of
onli a knight she gave the digniti of a baronet all it due;
and sir walter independ of hi claim as an old acquaint
an attent neighbour an oblig landlord the husband of her
veri dear friend the father of ann and her sister wa
as be sir walter in her apprehens entitl to a great deal
of compass and consider under hi present difficulti

they must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt but she wa
veri anxiou to have it done with the least possibl pain to him
and elizabeth she drew up plan of economi she made exact calcul
and she did what nobodi els thought of doing: she consult ann
who never seem consid by the other as have ani interest
in the question she consult and in a degre wa influenc by her
in mark out the scheme of retrench which wa at last submit
to sir walter everi emend of ann had been on the side of
honesti against import she want more vigor measur
a more complet reform a quicker releas from debt
a much higher tone of indiffer for everyth but justic and equiti

if we can persuad your father to all thi said ladi russel
look over her paper much may be done if he will adopt
these regul in seven year he will be clear; and i hope
we may be abl to convinc him and elizabeth that kellynch hall ha
a respect in itself which cannot be affect by these reductions;
and that the true digniti of sir walter elliot will be veri far from
lessen in the eye of sensibl peopl by act like a man of principl
what will he be do in fact but what veri mani of our first famili
have done or ought to do? there will be noth singular in hi case;
and it is singular which often make the worst part of our suffer
as it alway doe of our conduct i have great hope of prevail
we must be seriou and decided; for after all the person who
ha contract debt must pay them; and though a great deal is due to
the feel of the gentleman and the head of a hous like your father
there is still more due to the charact of an honest man

thi wa the principl on which ann want her father to be proceed
hi friend to be urg him she consid it as an act
of indispens duti to clear away the claim of creditor with
all the expedit which the most comprehens retrench
could secur and saw no digniti in anyth short of it
she want it to be prescrib and felt as a duti she rate
ladi russel influenc highly; and as to the sever degre
of self-deni which her own conscienc prompt she believ
there might be littl more difficulti in persuad them to a complet
than to half a reform her knowledg of her father
and elizabeth inclin her to think that the sacrific of one pair
of hors would be hardli less pain than of both and so on
through the whole list of ladi russel too gentl reduct

how ann more rigid requisit might have been taken
is of littl consequ ladi russel had no success at all:
could not be put up with were not to be born what! everi comfort
of life knock off! journey london servant hors table--
contract and restrict everi where! to live no longer
with the decenc even of a privat gentleman! no he would sooner
quit kellynch hall at onc than remain in it on such disgrac term

quit kellynch hall the hint wa immedi taken up by mr shepherd
whose interest wa involv in the realiti of sir walter retrench
and who wa perfectli persuad that noth would be done without
a chang of abod sinc the idea had been start in the veri quarter
which ought to dictat he had no scrupl he said in confess
hi judgement to be entir on that side it did not appear to him
that sir walter could materi alter hi style of live in a hous
which had such a charact of hospit and ancient digniti to support
in ani other place sir walter might judg for himself; and would
be look up to as regul the mode of life in whatev way
he might choos to model hi household

sir walter would quit kellynch hall; and after a veri few day more
of doubt and indecis the great question of whither he should go
wa settl and the first outlin of thi import chang made out

there had been three altern london bath or anoth hous
in the countri all ann wish had been for the latter
a small hous in their own neighbourhood where they might still have
ladi russel societi still be near mari and still have the pleasur
of sometim see the lawn and grove of kellynch wa the object
of her ambit but the usual fate of ann attend her
in have someth veri opposit from her inclin fix on
she dislik bath and did not think it agre with her;
and bath wa to be her home

sir walter had at first thought more of london; but mr shepherd felt
that he could not be trust in london and had been skil enough
to dissuad him from it and make bath prefer it wa a much safer
place for a gentleman in hi predicament: he might there be import
at compar littl expens two materi advantag of bath
over london had of cours been given all their weight: it more conveni
distanc from kellynch onli fifti mile and ladi russel spend
some part of everi winter there; and to the veri great satisfact
of ladi russel whose first view on the project chang had been
for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induc to believ that
they should lose neither consequ nor enjoy by settl there

ladi russel felt oblig to oppos her dear ann known wish
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small hous
in hi own neighbourhood ann herself would have found
the mortif of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter
feel they must have been dread and with regard to ann
dislik of bath she consid it as a prejudic and mistak aris
first from the circumst of her have been three year
at school there after her mother death; and secondli
from her happen to be not in perfectli good spirit the onli winter
which she had afterward spent there with herself

ladi russel wa fond of bath in short and dispos to think
it must suit them all; and as to her young friend health
by pass all the warm month with her at kellynch lodg
everi danger would be avoided; and it wa in fact a chang which must
do both health and spirit good ann had been too littl from home
too littl seen her spirit were not high a larger societi
would improv them she want her to be more known

the undesir of ani other hous in the same neighbourhood
for sir walter wa certainli much strengthen by one part
and a veri materi part of the scheme which had been happili
engraft on the begin he wa not onli to quit hi home
but to see it in the hand of others; a trial of fortitud
which stronger head than sir walter have found too much
kellynch hall wa to be let thi howev wa a profound secret
not to be breath beyond their own circl

sir walter could not have born the degrad of be known
to design let hi hous mr shepherd had onc mention the word
advertis but never dare approach it again sir walter spurn
the idea of it be offer in ani manner; forbad the slightest hint
be drop of hi have such an intention; and it wa onli on
the supposit of hi be spontan solicit by some most
unexception applic on hi own term and as a great favour
that he would let it at all

how quick come the reason for approv what we like! ladi russel had
anoth excel one at hand for be extrem glad that sir walter
and hi famili were to remov from the countri elizabeth had been
late form an intimaci which she wish to see interrupt
it wa with the daughter of mr shepherd who had return
after an unprosper marriag to her father hous with
the addit burden of two children she wa a clever young woman
who understood the art of pleasing--th art of pleas at least
at kellynch hall; and who had made herself so accept to miss elliot
as to have been alreadi stay there more than onc in spite of all
that ladi russel who thought it a friendship quit out of place
could hint of caution and reserv

ladi russel inde had scarc ani influenc with elizabeth
and seem to love her rather becaus she would love her
than becaus elizabeth deserv it she had never receiv from her more
than outward attent noth beyond the observ of complaisance;
had never succeed in ani point which she want to carri
against previou inclin she had been repeatedli veri earnest
in tri to get ann includ in the visit to london sensibl open
to all the injustic and all the discredit of the selfish arrang
which shut her out and on mani lesser occas had endeavour
to give elizabeth the advantag of her own better judgement and experience;
but alway in vain: elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she
pursu it in more decid opposit to ladi russel than in
thi select of mr clay; turn from the societi of so deserv
a sister to bestow her affect and confid on one who ought
to have been noth to her but the object of distant civil

from situat mr clay wa in ladi russel estim a veri unequ
and in her charact she believ a veri danger companion;
and a remov that would leav mr clay behind and bring a choic
of more suitabl intim within miss elliot reach wa therefor
an object of first-rat import



chapter 3


i must take leav to observ sir walter said mr shepherd
one morn at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspap
that the present junctur is much in our favour thi peac will
be turn all our rich naval offic ashor they will be
all want a home could not be a better time sir walter
for have a choic of tenant veri respons tenant
mani a nobl fortun ha been made dure the war if a rich admir
were to come in our way sir walter--

he would be a veri lucki man shepherd repli sir walter;
that all i have to remark a prize inde would kellynch hall
be to him; rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken
ever so mani before; hey shepherd?

mr shepherd laugh as he knew he must at thi wit and then added--

i presum to observ sir walter that in the way of busi
gentlemen of the navi are well to deal with i have had a littl knowledg
of their method of do business; and i am free to confess that they
have veri liber notion and are as like to make desir tenant
as ani set of peopl one should meet with therefor sir walter
what i would take leav to suggest is that if in consequ of
ani rumour get abroad of your intention; which must be contempl
as a possibl thing becaus we know how difficult it is to keep
the action and design of one part of the world from the notic
and curios of the other; consequ ha it tax; i john shepherd
might conceal ani family-matt that i chose for nobodi would think it
worth their while to observ me; but sir walter elliot ha eye upon him
which it may be veri difficult to elude; and therefor thu much
i ventur upon that it will not greatli surpris me if
with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad;
in the supposit of which as i wa go to observ sinc applic
will unquestion follow i should think ani from our wealthi
naval command particularli worth attend to; and beg leav to add
that two hour will bring me over at ani time to save you
the troubl of repli

sir walter onli nod but soon afterward rise and pace the room
he observ sarcastically--

there are few among the gentlemen of the navi i imagin who would
not be surpris to find themselv in a hous of thi descript

they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortun
said mr clay for mr clay wa present: her father had driven her over
noth be of so much use to mr clay health as a drive to kellynch:
but i quit agre with my father in think a sailor might be
a veri desir tenant i have known a good deal of the profession;
and besid their liber they are so neat and care
in all their ways! these valuabl pictur of your sir walter
if you chose to leav them would be perfectli safe everyth in
and about the hous would be taken such excel care of!
the garden and shrubberi would be kept in almost as high order
as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own
sweet flower garden be neglect

as to all that rejoin sir walter coolli suppos i were induc
to let my hous i have by no mean made up my mind as to the privileg
to be annex to it i am not particularli dispos to favour a tenant
the park would be open to him of cours and few navi offic
or men of ani other descript can have had such a range;
but what restrict i might impos on the use of the pleasure-ground
is anoth thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberi be
alway approachable; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard
with respect to her flower garden i am veri littl dispos
to grant a tenant of kellynch hall ani extraordinari favour
i assur you be he sailor or soldier

after a short paus mr shepherd presum to say--

in all these case there are establish usag which
make everyth plain and easi between landlord and tenant
your interest sir walter is in pretti safe hand depend upon me
for take care that no tenant ha more than hi just right
i ventur to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealou
for hi own as john shepherd will be for him

here ann spoke--

the navi i think who have done so much for us have at least
an equal claim with ani other set of men for all the comfort and
all the privileg which ani home can give sailor work hard enough
for their comfort we must all allow

veri true veri true what miss ann say is veri true
wa mr shepherd rejoind and oh! certainli wa hi daughters;
but sir walter remark wa soon afterwards--

the profess ha it util but i should be sorri to see
ani friend of mine belong to it

indeed! wa the repli and with a look of surpris

yes; it is in two point offens to me; i have two strong ground
of object to it first as be the mean of bring person
of obscur birth into undu distinct and rais men to honour
which their father and grandfath never dreamt of; and secondli
as it cut up a man youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grow old
sooner than ani other man i have observ it all my life
a man is in greater danger in the navi of be insult by the rise
of one whose father hi father might have disdain to speak to
and of becom prematur an object of disgust himself than in
ani other line one day last spring in town i wa in compani
with two men strike instanc of what i am talk of;
lord st ive whose father we all know to have been a countri curat
without bread to eat; i wa to give place to lord st ive
and a certain admir baldwin the most deplorable-look personag
you can imagine; hi face the colour of mahogani rough and rug
to the last degree; all line and wrinkl nine grey hair of a side
and noth but a dab of powder at top `in the name of heaven
who is that old fellow? said i to a friend of mine who wa stand near
(sir basil morley) `old fellow! cri sir basil `it is admir baldwin
what do you take hi age to be? `sixti said i `or perhap sixty-two
`forti repli sir basil `forti and no more pictur to yourselv
my amazement; i shall not easili forget admir baldwin
i never saw quit so wretch an exampl of what a sea-far life can do;
but to a degre i know it is the same with them all: they are all
knock about and expos to everi climat and everi weather
till they are not fit to be seen it is a piti they are not knock
on the head at onc befor they reach admir baldwin age

nay sir walter cri mr clay thi is be sever inde
have a littl merci on the poor men we are not all born to be handsom
the sea is no beautifi certainly; sailor do grow old betimes;
i have observ it; they soon lose the look of youth but then
is not it the same with mani other profess perhap most other?
soldier in activ servic are not at all better off: and even in
the quieter profess there is a toil and a labour of the mind
if not of the bodi which seldom leav a man look to the natur
effect of time the lawyer plod quit care-worn; the physician
is up at all hour and travel in all weather; and even
the clergyman-- she stopt a moment to consid what might
do for the clergyman;--and even the clergyman you know is oblig
to go into infect room and expos hi health and look to
all the injuri of a poison atmospher in fact as i have
long been convinc though everi profess is necessari and honour
in it turn it is onli the lot of those who are not oblig to follow ani
who can live in a regular way in the countri choos their own hour
follow their own pursuit and live on their own properti
without the torment of tri for more; it is onli their lot i say
to hold the bless of health and a good appear to the utmost:
i know no other set of men but what lose someth of their person
when they ceas to be quit young

it seem as if mr shepherd in thi anxieti to bespeak
sir walter good will toward a naval offic as tenant
had been gift with foresight; for the veri first applic
for the hous wa from an admir croft with whom he shortli afterward
fell into compani in attend the quarter session at taunton; and inde
he had receiv a hint of the admir from a london correspond
by the report which he hasten over to kellynch to make
admir croft wa a nativ of somersetshir who have acquir
a veri handsom fortun wa wish to settl in hi own countri
and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertis place
in that immedi neighbourhood which howev had not suit him;
that accident hearing--(it wa just as he had foretold
mr shepherd observ sir walter concern could not be kept a secret)--
accident hear of the possibl of kellynch hall be to let
and understand hi (mr shepherds) connect with the owner
he had introduc himself to him in order to make particular inquiri
and had in the cours of a pretti long confer express as strong
an inclin for the place as a man who knew it onli by descript
could feel; and given mr shepherd in hi explicit account of himself
everi proof of hi be a most respons elig tenant

and who is admir croft? wa sir walter cold suspici inquiri

mr shepherd answer for hi be of a gentleman famili
and mention a place; and ann after the littl paus which follow
added--

he is a rear admir of the white he wa in the trafalgar action
and ha been in the east indi since; he wa station there
i believ sever year

then i take it for grant observ sir walter that hi face
is about as orang as the cuff and cape of my liveri

mr shepherd hasten to assur him that admir croft wa a veri hale
hearti well-look man a littl weather-beaten to be sure
but not much and quit the gentleman in all hi notion and behaviour;
not like to make the smallest difficulti about term onli want
a comfort home and to get into it as soon as possible;
knew he must pay for hi convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnish
hous of that consequ might fetch; should not have been surpris
if sir walter had ask more; had inquir about the manor;
would be glad of the deput certainli but made no great point of it;
said he sometim took out a gun but never killed; quit the gentleman

mr shepherd wa eloqu on the subject; point out all
the circumst of the admir famili which made him
peculiarli desir as a tenant he wa a marri man
and without children; the veri state to be wish for a hous wa
never taken good care of mr shepherd observ without a lady:
he did not know whether furnitur might not be in danger of suffer
as much where there wa no ladi as where there were mani children
a ladi without a famili wa the veri best preserv of furnitur
in the world he had seen mr croft too; she wa at taunton
with the admir and had been present almost all the time they were
talk the matter over

and a veri well-spoken genteel shrewd ladi she seem to be
continu he; ask more question about the hous and term
and tax than the admir himself and seem more convers
with business; and moreov sir walter i found she wa not quit
unconnect in thi countri ani more than her husband; that is to say
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;
she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who live
a few year back at monkford bless me! what wa hi name?
at thi moment i cannot recollect hi name though i have heard it so late
penelop my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman
who live at monkford: mr croft brother?

but mr clay wa talk so eagerli with miss elliot that she did not
hear the appeal

i have no concept whom you can mean shepherd; i rememb
no gentleman resid at monkford sinc the time of old governor trent

bless me! how veri odd! i shall forget my own name soon i suppos
a name that i am so veri well acquaint with; knew the gentleman
so well by sight; seen him a hundr times; came to consult me onc
i rememb about a trespass of one of hi neighbours; farmer man
break into hi orchard; wall torn down; appl stolen;
caught in the fact; and afterward contrari to my judgement
submit to an amic compromis veri odd indeed!

after wait anoth moment--

you mean mr wentworth i suppose? said ann

mr shepherd wa all gratitud

wentworth wa the veri name! mr wentworth wa the veri man
he had the curaci of monkford you know sir walter some time back
for two or three year came there about the year ---5 i take it
you rememb him i am sure

wentworth? oh! ay--mr wentworth the curat of monkford
you misl me by the term gentleman i thought you were speak of
some man of property: mr wentworth wa nobodi i remember;
quit unconnected; noth to do with the strafford famili
one wonder how the name of mani of our nobil becom so common

as mr shepherd perceiv that thi connexion of the croft did them
no servic with sir walter he mention it no more; return
with all hi zeal to dwell on the circumst more indisput
in their favour; their age and number and fortune; the high idea
they had form of kellynch hall and extrem solicitud for
the advantag of rent it; make it appear as if they rank
noth beyond the happi of be the tenant of sir walter elliot:
an extraordinari tast certainli could they have been suppos in
the secret of sir walter estim of the due of a tenant

it succeed however; and though sir walter must ever look with
an evil eye on anyon intend to inhabit that hous and think them
infinit too well off in be permit to rent it on the highest term
he wa talk into allow mr shepherd to proceed in the treati
and authoris him to wait on admir croft who still remain
at taunton and fix a day for the hous be seen

sir walter wa not veri wise; but still he had experi enough
of the world to feel that a more unobjection tenant
in all essenti than admir croft bid fair to be could hardli offer
so far went hi understanding; and hi vaniti suppli a littl
addit sooth in the admir situat in life which wa just
high enough and not too high i have let my hous to admir croft
would sound extrem well; veri much better than to ani mere mr--;
a mr (save perhap some half dozen in the nation) alway need
a note of explan an admir speak hi own consequ
and at the same time can never make a baronet look small
in all their deal and intercours sir walter elliot must ever
have the preced

noth could be done without a refer to elizabeth:
but her inclin wa grow so strong for a remov
that she wa happi to have it fix and expedit by a tenant at hand;
and not a word to suspend decis wa utter by her

mr shepherd wa complet empow to act; and no sooner had
such an end been reach than ann who had been a most attent listen
to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her
flush cheeks; and as she walk along a favourit grove said
with a gentl sigh a few month more and he perhap
may be walk here



chapter 4


he wa not mr wentworth the former curat of monkford
howev suspici appear may be but a captain frederick wentworth
hi brother who be made command in consequ of the action
off st domingo and not immedi employ had come into somersetshir
in the summer of 1806; and have no parent live found a home
for half a year at monkford he wa at that time a remark fine
young man with a great deal of intellig spirit and brilliancy;
and ann an extrem pretti girl with gentl modesti tast
and feel half the sum of attract on either side might have
been enough for he had noth to do and she had hardli anybodi to love;
but the encount of such lavish recommend could not fail
they were gradual acquaint and when acquaint rapidli and
deepli in love it would be difficult to say which had seen
highest perfect in the other or which had been the happiest:
she in receiv hi declar and propos or he in
have them accept

a short period of exquisit felic follow and but a short one
troubl soon aros sir walter on be appli to without actual
withhold hi consent or say it should never be gave it all
the neg of great astonish great cold great silenc
and a profess resolut of do noth for hi daughter
he thought it a veri degrad alliance; and ladi russel though with
more temper and pardon pride receiv it as a most unfortun one

ann elliot with all her claim of birth beauti and mind
to throw herself away at nineteen; involv herself at nineteen
in an engag with a young man who had noth but himself
to recommend him and no hope of attain affluenc but in the chanc
of a most uncertain profess and no connexion to secur
even hi farther rise in the profess would be inde a throw away
which she griev to think of! ann elliot so young; known to so few
to be snatch off by a stranger without allianc or fortune;
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wear anxiou
youth-kil dependence! it must not be if by ani fair interfer
of friendship ani represent from one who had almost a mother love
and mother right it would be prevent

captain wentworth had no fortun he had been lucki in hi profession;
but spend freeli what had come freeli had realiz noth
but he wa confid that he should soon be rich:
full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship
and soon be on a station that would lead to everyth he want
he had alway been lucky; he knew he should be so still
such confid power in it own warmth and bewitch in
the wit which often express it must have been enough for anne;
but ladi russel saw it veri differ hi sanguin temper
and fearless of mind oper veri differ on her
she saw in it but an aggrav of the evil it onli ad a
danger charact to himself he wa brilliant he wa headstrong
ladi russel had littl tast for wit and of anyth approach
to imprud a horror she deprec the connexion in everi light

such opposit as these feel produc wa more than
ann could combat young and gentl as she wa it might yet
have been possibl to withstand her father ill-wil
though unsoften by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;
but ladi russel whom she had alway love and reli on could not
with such steadi of opinion and such tender of manner
be continu advis her in vain she wa persuad to believ
the engag a wrong thing: indiscreet improp hardli capabl
of success and not deserv it but it wa not a mere selfish caution
under which she act in put an end to it had she not
imagin herself consult hi good even more than her own
she could hardli have given him up the belief of be prudent
and self-deni princip for hi advantag wa her chief consol
under the miseri of a part a final parting; and everi consol
wa requir for she had to encount all the addit pain of opinion
on hi side total unconvinc and unbend and of hi feel himself
ill use by so forc a relinquish he had left the countri
in consequ

a few month had seen the begin and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few month end ann share of suffer from it
her attach and regret had for a long time cloud everi
enjoy of youth and an earli loss of bloom and spirit
had been their last effect

more than seven year were gone sinc thi littl histori
of sorrow interest had reach it close; and time had
soften down much perhap nearli all of peculiar attach to him
but she had been too depend on time alone; no aid had been given
in chang of place (except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture)
or in ani novelti or enlarg of societi no one had ever
come within the kellynch circl who could bear a comparison with
frederick wentworth as he stood in her memori no second attach
the onli thoroughli natur happi and suffici cure
at her time of life had been possibl to the nice tone of her mind
the fastidi of her tast in the small limit of the societi
around them she had been solicit when about two-and-twenti
to chang her name by the young man who not long afterward found
a more will mind in her younger sister; and ladi russel had
lament her refusal; for charl musgrov wa the eldest son of a man
whose land properti and gener import were second in that countri
onli to sir walter and of good charact and appearance;
and howev ladi russel might have ask yet for someth more
while ann wa nineteen she would have rejoic to see her at twenty-two
so respect remov from the partial and injustic of
her father hous and settl so perman near herself
but in thi case ann had left noth for advic to do;
and though ladi russel as satisfi as ever with her own discret
never wish the past undon she began now to have the anxieti
which border on hopeless for ann be tempt by some man
of talent and independ to enter a state for which she held her
to be peculiarli fit by her warm affect and domest habit

they knew not each other opinion either it constanc or it chang
on the one lead point of ann conduct for the subject wa never
allud to; but ann at seven-and-twenti thought veri differ
from what she had been made to think at nineteen she did not blame
ladi russel she did not blame herself for have been guid by her;
but she felt that were ani young person in similar circumst
to appli to her for counsel they would never receiv ani of such
certain immedi wretched such uncertain futur good
she wa persuad that under everi disadvantag of disapprob at home
and everi anxieti attend hi profess all their probabl fear
delay and disappoint she should yet have been a happier woman
in maintain the engag than she had been in the sacrific of it;
and thi she fulli believ had the usual share had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitud and suspens been their
without refer to the actual result of their case which
as it happen would have bestow earlier prosper than
could be reason calcul on all hi sanguin expect
all hi confid had been justifi hi geniu and ardour
had seem to forese and to command hi prosper path
he had veri soon after their engag ceas got employ:
and all that he had told her would follow had taken place
he had distinguish himself and earli gain the other step in rank
and must now by success captur have made a handsom fortun
she had onli navi list and newspap for her author
but she could not doubt hi be rich; and in favour of hi constanc
she had no reason to believ him marri

how eloqu could ann elliot have been! how eloqu at least
were her wish on the side of earli warm attach and a cheer
confid in futur against that over-anxi caution which
seem to insult exert and distrust providence! she had been forc
into prudenc in her youth she learn romanc as she grew older:
the natur sequel of an unnatur begin

with all these circumst recollect and feel
she could not hear that captain wentworth sister wa like
to live at kellynch without a reviv of former pain; and mani a stroll
and mani a sigh were necessari to dispel the agit of the idea
she often told herself it wa folli befor she could harden her nerv
suffici to feel the continu discuss of the croft
and their busi no evil she wa assist howev by that
perfect indiffer and appar unconsci among the onli three
of her own friend in the secret of the past which seem almost to deni
ani recollect of it she could do justic to the superior
of ladi russel motiv in thi over those of her father and elizabeth;
she could honour all the better feel of her calmness;
but the gener air of oblivion among them wa highli import
from whatev it sprung; and in the event of admir croft realli
take kellynch hall she rejoic anew over the convict which
had alway been most grate to her of the past be known to
those three onli among her connexion by whom no syllabl
she believ would ever be whisper and in the trust that among hi
the brother onli with whom he had been resid had receiv
ani inform of their short-liv engag that brother had been
long remov from the countri and be a sensibl man and moreov
a singl man at the time she had a fond depend on no human creatur
have heard of it from him

the sister mr croft had then been out of england accompani
her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mari
had been at school while it all occurred; and never admit by
the pride of some and the delicaci of other to the smallest knowledg
of it afterward

with these support she hope that the acquaint between herself
and the croft which with ladi russel still resid in kellynch
and mari fix onli three mile off must be anticip
need not involv ani particular awkward



chapter 5


on the morn appoint for admir and mr croft see kellynch hall
ann found it most natur to take her almost daili walk to ladi russel
and keep out of the way till all wa over; when she found it most natur
to be sorri that she had miss the opportun of see them

thi meet of the two parti prove highli satisfactori
and decid the whole busi at onc each ladi wa previous
well dispos for an agreement and saw noth therefor
but good manner in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen
there wa such an hearti good humour such an open trust liber
on the admir side as could not but influenc sir walter
who had besid been flatter into hi veri best and most polish
behaviour by mr shepherd assur of hi be known by report
to the admir as a model of good breed

the hous and ground and furnitur were approv the croft
were approv term time everi thing and everi bodi wa right;
and mr shepherd clerk were set to work without there have been
a singl preliminari differ to modifi of all that
thi indentur sheweth

sir walter without hesit declar the admir to be
the best-look sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say
that if hi own man might have had the arrang of hi hair
he should not be asham of be seen with him ani where;
and the admir with sympathet cordial observ to hi wife
as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon
come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton
the baronet will never set the thame on fire but there seem to be
no harm in him reciproc compliment which would have been
esteem about equal

the croft were to have possess at michaelmas; and as sir walter
propos remov to bath in the cours of the preced month
there wa no time to be lost in make everi depend arrang

ladi russel convinc that ann would not be allow to be of ani use
or ani import in the choic of the hous which they were
go to secur wa veri unwil to have her hurri away so soon
and want to make it possibl for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to bath herself after christmas; but have engag
of her own which must take her from kellynch for sever week
she wa unabl to give the full invit she wish and ann
though dread the possibl heat of septemb in all the white glare
of bath and griev to forego all the influenc so sweet and so sad
of the autumn month in the countri did not think that
everyth consid she wish to remain it would be most right
and most wise and therefor must involv least suffer
to go with the other

someth occur howev to give her a differ duti
mari often a littl unwel and alway think a great deal
of her own complaint and alway in the habit of claim ann
when anyth wa the matter wa indisposed; and forese
that she should not have a day health all the autumn entreat
or rather requir her for it wa hardli entreati to come to
uppercross cottag and bear her compani as long as she should want her
instead of go to bath

i cannot possibl do without ann wa mari reasoning;
and elizabeth repli wa then i am sure ann had better stay
for nobodi will want her in bath

to be claim as a good though in an improp style is at least
better than be reject as no good at all; and ann glad to
be thought of some use glad to have anyth mark out as a duti
and certainli not sorri to have the scene of it in the countri
and her own dear countri readili agre to stay

thi invit of mari remov all ladi russel difficulti
and it wa consequ soon settl that ann should not go to bath
till ladi russel took her and that all the interven time
should be divid between uppercross cottag and kellynch lodg

so far all wa perfectli right; but ladi russel wa almost startl
by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her
which wa mr clay be engag to go to bath with sir walter
and elizabeth as a most import and valuabl assist to the latter
in all the busi befor her ladi russel wa extrem sorri
that such a measur should have been resort to at all wonder
griev and feared; and the affront it contain to ann
in mr clay be of so much use while ann could be of none
wa a veri sore aggrav

ann herself wa becom harden to such affronts; but she felt
the imprud of the arrang quit as keenli as ladi russel
with a great deal of quiet observ and a knowledg
which she often wish less of her father charact she wa
sensibl that result the most seriou to hi famili from the intimaci
were more than possibl she did not imagin that her father
had at present an idea of the kind mr clay had freckl
and a project tooth and a clumsi wrist which he wa continu
make sever remark upon in her absence; but she wa young
and certainli altogeth well-look and possess in an acut mind
and assidu pleas manner infinit more danger attract
than ani mere person might have been ann wa so impress
by the degre of their danger that she could not excus herself
from tri to make it percept to her sister she had littl hope
of success; but elizabeth who in the event of such a revers would be
so much more to be piti than herself should never she thought
have reason to reproach her for give no warn

she spoke and seem onli to offend elizabeth could not conceiv
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantli
answer for each parti perfectli know their situat

mr clay said she warmli never forget who she is;
and as i am rather better acquaint with her sentiment than you can be
i can assur you that upon the subject of marriag they are
particularli nice and that she reprob all inequ of condit
and rank more strongli than most peopl and as to my father
i realli should not have thought that he who ha kept himself singl
so long for our sake need be suspect now if mr clay were
a veri beauti woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her
so much with me; not that anyth in the world i am sure
would induc my father to make a degrad match but he might
be render unhappi but poor mr clay who with all her merit
can never have been reckon toler pretti i realli think poor
mr clay may be stay here in perfect safeti one would imagin
you had never heard my father speak of her person misfortun
though i know you must fifti time that tooth of her
and those freckl freckl do not disgust me so veri much
as they do him i have known a face not materi disfigur by a few
but he abomin them you must have heard him notic
mr clay freckl

there is hardli ani person defect repli ann
which an agreeabl manner might not gradual reconcil one to

i think veri differ answer elizabeth shortly;
an agreeabl manner may set off handsom featur but can never
alter plain one howev at ani rate as i have a great deal more
at stake on thi point than anybodi els can have i think it
rather unnecessari in you to be advis me

ann had done; glad that it wa over and not absolut hopeless
of do good elizabeth though resent the suspicion
might yet be made observ by it

the last offic of the four carriage-hors wa to draw sir walter
miss elliot and mr clay to bath the parti drove off in veri good spirits;
sir walter prepar with condescend bow for all the afflict
tenantri and cottag who might have had a hint to show themselv
and ann walk up at the same time in a sort of desol tranquil
to the lodg where she wa to spend the first week

her friend wa not in better spirit than herself ladi russel felt thi
break-up of the famili exceedingli their respect wa
as dear to her as her own and a daili intercours had becom
preciou by habit it wa pain to look upon their desert ground
and still wors to anticip the new hand they were to fall into;
and to escap the solitari and the melancholi of so alter a villag
and be out of the way when admir and mr croft first arriv
she had determin to make her own absenc from home begin
when she must give up ann accordingli their remov wa made togeth
and ann wa set down at uppercross cottag in the first stage
of ladi russel journey

uppercross wa a moderate-s villag which a few year back
had been complet in the old english style contain onli
two hous superior in appear to those of the yeomen and labourers;
the mansion of the squir with it high wall great gate and old tree
substanti and unmodern and the compact tight parsonag
enclos in it own neat garden with a vine and a pear-tre
train round it casements; but upon the marriag of the young squir
it had receiv the improv of a farm-hous elev into a cottag
for hi resid and uppercross cottag with it veranda
french window and other pretti wa quit as like to catch
the travel eye as the more consist and consider aspect
and premis of the great hous about a quarter of a mile farther on

here ann had often been stay she knew the way of uppercross
as well as those of kellynch the two famili were so continu meet
so much in the habit of run in and out of each other hous
at all hour that it wa rather a surpris to her to find mari alone;
but be alon her be unwel and out of spirit wa almost
a matter of cours though better endow than the elder sister
mari had not ann understand nor temper while well and happi
and properli attend to she had great good humour and excel spirits;
but ani indisposit sunk her complet she had no resourc
for solitude; and inherit a consider share of the elliot
self-import wa veri prone to add to everi other distress
that of fanci herself neglect and ill-us in person she wa
inferior to both sister and had even in her bloom onli reach
the digniti of be a fine girl she wa now lie on the fade sofa
of the pretti littl drawing-room the onc eleg furnitur of which
had been gradual grow shabbi under the influenc of four summer
and two children; and on ann appear greet her with--

so you are come at last! i began to think i should never see you
i am so ill i can hardli speak i have not seen a creatur
the whole morning!

i am sorri to find you unwel repli ann you sent me
such a good account of yourself on thursday!

ye i made the best of it; i alway do: but i wa veri far from well
at the time; and i do not think i ever wa so ill in my life
as i have been all thi morning: veri unfit to be left alon i am sure
suppos i were to be seiz of a sudden in some dread way
and not abl to ring the bell! so ladi russel would not get out
i do not think she ha been in thi hous three time thi summer

ann said what wa proper and enquir after her husband
oh! charl is out shoot i have not seen him sinc seven oclock
he would go though i told him how ill i wa he said he should not
stay out long; but he ha never come back and now it is almost one
i assur you i have not seen a soul thi whole long morn

you have had your littl boy with you?

ye as long as i could bear their noise; but they are so unmanag
that they do me more harm than good littl charl doe not mind
a word i say and walter is grow quit as bad

well you will soon be better now repli ann cheer
you know i alway cure you when i come how are your neighbour
at the great house?

i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to-day
except mr musgrov who just stop and spoke through the window
but without get off hi horse; and though i told him how ill i wa
not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit
the miss musgrov i suppos and they never put themselv
out of their way

you will see them yet perhap befor the morn is gone
it is earli

i never want them i assur you they talk and laugh a great deal
too much for me oh! ann i am so veri unwell! it wa quit unkind
of you not to come on thursday

my dear mari recollect what a comfort account you sent me of yourself!
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectli well
and in no hurri for me; and that be the case you must be awar
that my wish would be to remain with ladi russel to the last:
and besid what i felt on her account i have realli been so busi
have had so much to do that i could not veri conveni have
left kellynch sooner

dear me! what can you possibl have to do?

a great mani thing i assur you more than i can recollect
in a moment; but i can tell you some i have been make
a duplic of the catalogu of my father book and pictur
i have been sever time in the garden with mackenzi
tri to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth plant
are for ladi russel i have had all my own littl concern
to arrang book and music to divid and all my trunk to repack
from not have understood in time what wa intend as to the waggons:
and one thing i have had to do mari of a more tri nature:
go to almost everi hous in the parish as a sort of take-leav
i wa told that they wish it but all these thing took up
a great deal of time

oh! well! and after a moment paus but you have never ask me
one word about our dinner at the pool yesterday

did you go then? i have made no enquiri becaus i conclud
you must have been oblig to give up the parti

oh yes! i went i wa veri well yesterday; noth at all
the matter with me till thi morn it would have been strang
if i had not gone

i am veri glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant parti

noth remark one alway know beforehand what the dinner will be
and who will be there; and it is so veri uncomfort not have
a carriag of one own mr and mr musgrov took me and we were
so crowded! they are both so veri larg and take up so much room;
and mr musgrov alway sit forward so there wa i crowd into
the back seat with henrietta and louise; and i think it veri like
that my ill to-day may be owe to it

a littl further persever in patienc and forc cheer
on ann side produc nearli a cure on mari she could soon
sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be abl
to leav it by dinner-tim then forget to think of it
she wa at the other end of the room beautifi a nosegay;
then she ate her cold meat; and then she wa well enough
to propos a littl walk

where shall we go? said she when they were readi i suppos
you will not like to call at the great hous befor they have
been to see you?

i have not the smallest object on that account repli ann
i should never think of stand on such ceremoni with peopl i know
so well as mr and the miss musgrov

oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possibl
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister howev
we may as well go and sit with them a littl while and when we
have that over we can enjoy our walk

ann had alway thought such a style of intercours highli imprudent;
but she had ceas to endeavour to check it from believ that
though there were on each side continu subject of offenc
neither famili could now do without it to the great hous accordingli
they went to sit the full half hour in the old-fashion squar parlour
with a small carpet and shine floor to which the present
daughter of the hous were gradual give the proper air of confus
by a grand piano-fort and a harp flower-stand and littl tabl
place in everi direct oh! could the origin of the portrait
against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and
the ladi in blue satin have seen what wa go on have been consciou
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness! the portrait themselv
seem to be stare in astonish

the musgrov like their hous were in a state of alter
perhap of improv the father and mother were in the old
english style and the young peopl in the new mr and mr musgrov
were a veri good sort of people; friendli and hospit
not much educ and not at all eleg their children had
more modern mind and manner there wa a numer family;
but the onli two grown up except charl were henrietta and louisa
young ladi of nineteen and twenti who had brought from school at exet
all the usual stock of accomplish and were now like thousand
of other young ladi live to be fashion happi and merri
their dress had everi advantag their face were rather pretti
their spirit extrem good their manner unembarrass and pleasant;
they were of consequ at home and favourit abroad
ann alway contempl them as some of the happiest creatur
of her acquaintance; but still save as we all are by some
comfort feel of superior from wish for the possibl
of exchang she would not have given up her own more eleg
and cultiv mind for all their enjoyments; and envi them noth
but that seemingli perfect good understand and agreement togeth
that good-humour mutual affect of which she had known
so littl herself with either of her sister

they were receiv with great cordial noth seem amiss
on the side of the great hous famili which wa gener
as ann veri well knew the least to blame the half hour wa
chat away pleasantli enough; and she wa not at all surpris
at the end of it to have their walk parti join by both
the miss musgrov at mari particular invit



chapter 6


ann had not want thi visit to uppercross to learn that a remov
from one set of peopl to anoth though at a distanc of onli three mile
will often includ a total chang of convers opinion and idea
she had never been stay there befor without be struck by it
or without wish that other elliot could have her advantag
in see how unknown or unconsid there were the affair
which at kellynch hall were treat as of such gener public
and pervad interest; yet with all thi experi she believ
she must now submit to feel that anoth lesson in the art of know
our own nothing beyond our own circl wa becom necessari for her;
for certainli come as she did with a heart full of the subject
which had been complet occupi both hous in kellynch for mani week
she had expect rather more curios and sympathi than she found
in the separ but veri similar remark of mr and mr musgrove:
so miss ann sir walter and your sister are gone; and what part of bath
do you think they will settl in? and thi without much
wait for an answer; or in the young ladi addit of
i hope we shall be in bath in the winter; but rememb papa
if we do go we must be in a good situation: none of your
queen squar for us! or in the anxiou supplement from mari of--
upon my word i shall be pretti well off when you are all gone away
to be happi at bath!

she could onli resolv to avoid such self-delus in futur
and think with heighten gratitud of the extraordinari bless
of have one such truli sympathis friend as ladi russel

the mr musgrov had their own game to guard and to destroy
their own hors dog and newspap to engag them and the femal
were fulli occupi in all the other common subject of housekeep
neighbour dress danc and music she acknowledg it to be
veri fit that everi littl social commonwealth should dictat
it own matter of discourse; and hope ere long to becom
a not unworthi member of the one she wa now transplant into
with the prospect of spend at least two month at uppercross
it wa highli incumb on her to cloth her imagin her memori
and all her idea in as much of uppercross as possibl

she had no dread of these two month mari wa not so repuls
and unsisterli as elizabeth nor so inaccess to all influenc of hers;
neither wa there anyth among the other compon part
of the cottag inim to comfort she wa alway on friendli term
with her brother-in-law; and in the children who love her nearli as well
and respect her a great deal more than their mother she had
an object of interest amus and wholesom exert

charl musgrov wa civil and agreeable; in sens and temper he wa
undoubtedli superior to hi wife but not of power or convers
or grace to make the past as they were connect togeth
at all a danger contemplation; though at the same time
ann could believ with ladi russel that a more equal match
might have greatli improv him; and that a woman of real understand
might have given more consequ to hi charact and more use
ration and eleg to hi habit and pursuit as it wa
he did noth with much zeal but sport; and hi time wa otherwis
trifl away without benefit from book or anyth els
he had veri good spirit which never seem much affect by
hi wife occasion low bore with her unreason
sometim to ann admir and upon the whole though there wa
veri often a littl disagr (in which she had sometim more share
than she wish be appeal to by both parties) they might pass
for a happi coupl they were alway perfectli agre in the want
of more money and a strong inclin for a handsom present
from hi father; but here as on most topic he had the superior
for while mari thought it a great shame that such a present wa not made
he alway contend for hi father have mani other use for hi money
and a right to spend it as he like

as to the manag of their children hi theori wa much better
than hi wife and hi practic not so bad i could manag them
veri well if it were not for mari interfer wa what
ann often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in;
but when listen in turn to mari reproach of charl spoil
the children so that i cannot get them into ani order she never had
the smallest temptat to say veri true

one of the least agreeabl circumst of her resid there
wa her be treat with too much confid by all parti
and be too much in the secret of the complaint of each hous
known to have some influenc with her sister she wa continu request
or at least receiv hint to exert it beyond what wa practic
i wish you could persuad mari not to be alway fanci herself ill
wa charless language; and in an unhappi mood thu spoke mary:
i do believ if charl were to see me die he would not think
there wa anyth the matter with me i am sure ann if you would
you might persuad him that i realli am veri ill--a great deal wors
than i ever own

mari declar wa i hate send the children to the great hous
though their grandmamma is alway want to see them for she humour
and indulg them to such a degre and give them so much trash
and sweet thing that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day and mr musgrov took the first opportun
of be alon with ann to say oh! miss ann i cannot help wish
mr charl had a littl of your method with those children
they are quit differ creatur with you! but to be sure
in gener they are so spoilt! it is a piti you cannot put your sister
in the way of manag them they are as fine healthi children
as ever were seen poor littl dears! without partiality;
but mr charl know no more how they should be treated--!
bless me! how troublesom they are sometim i assur you miss ann
it prevent my wish to see them at our hous so often as
i otherwis should i believ mr charl is not quit pleas
with my not invit them oftener; but you know it is veri bad
to have children with one that one is oblig to be check
everi moment; dont do thi and dont do that; or that one can
onli keep in toler order by more cake than is good for them

she had thi commun moreov from mari mr musgrov think
all her servant so steadi that it would be high treason
to call it in question; but i am sure without exagger
that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of be
in their busi are gad about the villag all day long
i meet them wherev i go; and i declar i never go twice into my nurseri
without see someth of them if jemima were not the trustiest
steadiest creatur in the world it would be enough to spoil her;
for she tell me they are alway tempt her to take a walk with them
and on mr musgrov side it wa i make a rule of never interf
in ani of my daughter-in-law concern for i know it would not do;
but i shall tell you miss ann becaus you may be abl to set thing
to right that i have no veri good opinion of mr charless nursery-maid:
i hear strang stori of her; she is alway upon the gad; and from
my own knowledg i can declar she is such a fine-dress ladi
that she is enough to ruin ani servant she come near
mr charl quit swear by her i know; but i just give you thi hint
that you may be upon the watch; becaus if you see anyth amiss
you need not be afraid of mention it

again it wa mari complaint that mr musgrov wa veri apt
not to give her the preced that wa her due when they dine
at the great hous with other families; and she did not see ani reason
whi she wa to be consid so much at home as to lose her place
and one day when ann wa walk with onli the musgrov one of them
after talk of rank peopl of rank and jealousi of rank said
i have no scrupl of observ to you how nonsens some person are
about their place becaus all the world know how easi and indiffer
you are about it; but i wish anybodi could give mari a hint that
it would be a great deal better if she were not so veri tenaci
especi if she would not be alway put herself forward to take
place of mamma nobodi doubt her right to have preced of mamma
but it would be more becom in her not to be alway insist on it
it is not that mamma care about it the least in the world
but i know it is taken notic of by mani person

how wa ann to set all these matter to rights? she could do littl more
than listen patient soften everi grievanc and excus each
to the other; give them all hint of the forbear necessari
between such near neighbour and make those hint broadest
which were meant for her sister benefit

in all other respect her visit began and proceed veri well
her own spirit improv by chang of place and subject
by be remov three mile from kellynch; mari ailment lessen
by have a constant companion and their daili intercours
with the other famili sinc there wa neither superior affect
confid nor employ in the cottag to be interrupt by it
wa rather an advantag it wa certainli carri nearli as far as possibl
for they met everi morn and hardli ever spent an even asunder;
but she believ they should not have done so well without the sight
of mr and mr musgrov respect form in the usual place
or without the talk laugh and sing of their daughter

she play a great deal better than either of the miss musgrov
but have no voic no knowledg of the harp and no fond parent
to sit by and fanci themselv delight her perform wa
littl thought of onli out of civil or to refresh the other
as she wa well awar she knew that when she play she wa
give pleasur onli to herself; but thi wa no new sensat
except one short period of her life she had never sinc the age
of fourteen never sinc the loss of her dear mother known the happi
of be listen to or encourag by ani just appreci or real tast
in music she had been alway use to feel alon in the world;
and mr and mr musgrov fond partial for their own daughter
perform and total indiffer to ani other person
gave her much more pleasur for their sake than mortif
for her own

the parti at the great hous wa sometim increas by other compani
the neighbourhood wa not larg but the musgrov were visit
by everybodi and had more dinner-parti and more caller
more visitor by invit and by chanc than ani other famili
there were more complet popular

the girl were wild for dancing; and the even end occasion
in an unpremedit littl ball there wa a famili of cousin
within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumst
who depend on the musgrov for all their pleasures: they would come
at ani time and help play at anyth or danc anywhere; and ann
veri much prefer the offic of musician to a more activ post
play countri danc to them by the hour together; a kind which
alway recommend her music power to the notic of mr and mr musgrov
more than anyth els and often drew thi compliment;--
well done miss anne! veri well done indeed! lord bless me!
how those littl finger of your fli about!

so pass the first three week michaelma came; and now ann heart
must be in kellynch again a belov home made over to others;
all the preciou room and furnitur grove and prospect
begin to own other eye and other limbs! she could not
think of much els on the 29th of september; and she had thi
sympathet touch in the even from mari who on have occas
to note down the day of the month exclaim dear me is not thi
the day the croft were to come to kellynch? i am glad i did not
think of it befor how low it make me!

the croft took possess with true naval alert and were
to be visit mari deplor the necess for herself
nobodi knew how much she should suffer she should put it off
as long as she could; but wa not easi till she had talk charl
into drive her over on an earli day and wa in a veri anim
comfort state of imaginari agit when she came back
ann had veri sincer rejoic in there be no mean of her go
she wish howev to see the croft and wa glad to be within
when the visit wa return they came: the master of the hous
wa not at home but the two sister were together; and as it chanc
that mr croft fell to the share of ann while the admir sat by mari
and made himself veri agreeabl by hi good-humour notic
of her littl boy she wa well abl to watch for a like
and if it fail her in the featur to catch it in the voic
or in the turn of sentiment and express

mr croft though neither tall nor fat had a squar
upright and vigour of form which gave import to her person
she had bright dark eye good teeth and altogeth an agreeabl face;
though her redden and weather-beaten complexion the consequ
of her have been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to
have live some year longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirti
her manner were open easi and decid like one who had
no distrust of herself and no doubt of what to do; without ani
approach to coars howev or ani want of good humour
ann gave her credit inde for feel of great consider
toward herself in all that relat to kellynch and it pleas her:
especi as she had satisfi herself in the veri first half minut
in the instant even of introduct that there wa not the smallest
symptom of ani knowledg or suspicion on mr croft side to give a bia
of ani sort she wa quit easi on that head and consequ
full of strength and courag till for a moment electrifi by
mr croft suddenli saying--

it wa you and not your sister i find that my brother had
the pleasur of be acquaint with when he wa in thi countri

ann hope she had outliv the age of blushing; but the age of emot
she certainli had not

perhap you may not have heard that he is married? ad mr croft

she could now answer as she ought; and wa happi to feel
when mr croft next word explain it to be mr wentworth
of whom she spoke that she had said noth which might not do
for either brother she immedi felt how reason it wa
that mr croft should be think and speak of edward
and not of frederick; and with shame at her own forget
appli herself to the knowledg of their former neighbour
present state with proper interest

the rest wa all tranquillity; till just as they were move
she heard the admir say to mary--

we are expect a brother of mr croft here soon; i dare say
you know him by name

he wa cut short by the eager attack of the littl boy
cling to him like an old friend and declar he should not go;
and be too much engross by propos of carri them away
in hi coat pocket &c to have anoth moment for finish
or recollect what he had begun ann wa left to persuad herself
as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question
she could not howev reach such a degre of certainti
as not to be anxiou to hear whether anyth had been said on the subject
at the other hous where the croft had previous been call

the folk of the great hous were to spend the even of thi day
at the cottage; and it be now too late in the year for such visit
to be made on foot the coach wa begin to be listen for
when the youngest miss musgrov walk in that she wa come
to apolog and that they should have to spend the even by themselv
wa the first black idea; and mari wa quit readi to be affront
when louisa made all right by say that she onli came on foot
to leav more room for the harp which wa bring in the carriag

and i will tell you our reason she ad and all about it
i am come on to give you notic that papa and mamma are
out of spirit thi even especi mamma; she is think so much
of poor richard! and we agre it would be best to have the harp
for it seem to amus her more than the piano-fort i will tell you
whi she is out of spirit when the croft call thi morn
(they call here afterward did not they?) they happen to say
that her brother captain wentworth is just return to england
or paid off or someth and is come to see them almost directly;
and most unluckili it came into mamma head when they were gone
that wentworth or someth veri like it wa the name of
poor richard captain at one time; i do not know when or where
but a great while befor he die poor fellow! and upon look over
hi letter and thing she found it wa so and is perfectli sure
that thi must be the veri man and her head is quit full of it
and of poor richard! so we must be as merri as we can that she may not
be dwell upon such gloomi thing

the real circumst of thi pathet piec of famili histori were
that the musgrov had had the ill fortun of a veri troublesom
hopeless son; and the good fortun to lose him befor he reach
hi twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea becaus he wa stupid
and unmanag on shore; that he had been veri littl care for
at ani time by hi famili though quit as much as he deserved;
seldom heard of and scarc at all regret when the intellig
of hi death abroad had work it way to uppercross two year befor

he had in fact though hi sister were now do all they could for him
by call him poor richard been noth better than a thick-head
unfeel unprofit dick musgrov who had never done anyth
to entitl himself to more than the abbrevi of hi name
live or dead

he had been sever year at sea and had in the cours of those remov
to which all midshipmen are liabl and especi such midshipmen
as everi captain wish to get rid of been six month on board
captain frederick wentworth frigat the laconia; and from the laconia
he had under the influenc of hi captain written the onli two letter
which hi father and mother had ever receiv from him dure the whole
of hi absence; that is to say the onli two disinterest letters;
all the rest had been mere applic for money

in each letter he had spoken well of hi captain; but yet
so littl were they in the habit of attend to such matter
so unobserv and incuri were they as to the name of men or ship
that it had made scarc ani impress at the time; and that mr musgrov
should have been suddenli struck thi veri day with a recollect
of the name of wentworth as connect with her son seem one of those
extraordinari burst of mind which do sometim occur

she had gone to her letter and found it all as she supposed;
and the re-perus of these letter after so long an interv
her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of hi fault forgotten
had affect her spirit exceedingli and thrown her into
greater grief for him than she had know on first hear of hi death
mr musgrov wa in a lesser degre affect likewise; and when
they reach the cottag they were evid in want first
of be listen to anew on thi subject and afterward
of all the relief which cheer companion could give them

to hear them talk so much of captain wentworth repeat hi name
so often puzzl over past year and at last ascertain that it might
that it probabl would turn out to be the veri same captain wentworth
whom they recollect meet onc or twice after their come back
from clifton--a veri fine young man--but they could not say whether
it wa seven or eight year ago wa a new sort of trial to ann nerv
she found howev that it wa one to which she must inur herself
sinc he actual wa expect in the countri she must teach herself
to be insens on such point and not onli did it appear that
he wa expect and speedili but the musgrov in their warm gratitud
for the kind he had shewn poor dick and veri high respect
for hi charact stamp as it wa by poor dick have been
six month under hi care and mention him in strong
though not perfectli well-spelt prais as a fine dash felow
onli two perticular about the schoolmast were bent on
introduc themselv and seek hi acquaint as soon as
they could hear of hi arriv

the resolut of do so help to form the comfort of their even



chapter 7


a veri few day more and captain wentworth wa known to be at kellynch
and mr musgrov had call on him and come back warm in hi prais
and he wa engag with the croft to dine at uppercross
by the end of anoth week it had been a great disappoint
to mr musgrov to find that no earlier day could be fix
so impati wa he to shew hi gratitud by see captain wentworth
under hi own roof and welcom him to all that wa strongest
and best in hi cellar but a week must pass; onli a week
in ann reckon and then she suppos they must meet;
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secur even for a week

captain wentworth made a veri earli return to mr musgrov civil
and she wa all but call there in the same half hour
she and mari were actual set forward for the great hous
where as she afterward learnt they must inevit have found him
when they were stop by the eldest boy be at that moment
brought home in consequ of a bad fall the child situat
put the visit entir aside; but she could not hear of her escap
with indiffer even in the midst of the seriou anxieti
which they afterward felt on hi account

hi collar-bon wa found to be disloc and such injuri
receiv in the back as rous the most alarm idea
it wa an afternoon of distress and ann had everi thing to do at once;
the apothecari to send for the father to have pursu and inform
the mother to support and keep from hyster the servant to control
the youngest child to banish and the poor suffer one to attend
and soothe; besid send as soon as she recollect it
proper notic to the other hous which brought her an access
rather of frighten enquir companion than of veri use assist

her brother return wa the first comfort; he could take best care
of hi wife; and the second bless wa the arriv of the apothecari
till he came and had examin the child their apprehens were
the wors for be vague; they suspect great injuri but knew not where;
but now the collar-bon wa soon replac and though mr robinson
felt and felt and rub and look grave and spoke low word
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best
and to be abl to part and eat their dinner in toler eas of mind;
and then it wa just befor they part that the two young aunt
were abl so far to digress from their nephew state as to give
the inform of captain wentworth visit; stay five minut behind
their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectli delight
they were with him how much handsom how infinit more agreeabl
they thought him than ani individu among their male acquaint
who had been at all a favourit befor how glad they had been
to hear papa invit him to stay dinner how sorri when he said
it wa quit out of hi power and how glad again when he had promis
in repli to papa and mamma farther press invit to come
and dine with them on the morrow--actu on the morrow;
and he had promis it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt
all the motiv of their attent just as he ought and in short
he had look and said everyth with such exquisit grace
that they could assur them all their head were both turn by him;
and off they ran quit as full of glee as of love and appar
more full of captain wentworth than of littl charl

the same stori and the same raptur were repeat when the two girl came
with their father through the gloom of the even to make enquiries;
and mr musgrov no longer under the first uneasi about hi heir
could add hi confirm and prais and hope there would be now
no occas for put captain wentworth off and onli be sorri to think
that the cottag parti probabl would not like to leav the littl boy
to give him the meet oh no; as to leav the littl boy
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought; and ann in the joy of the escap
could not help ad her warm protest to their

charl musgrov inde afterward shew more of inclination;
the child wa go on so well and he wish so much to be introduc
to captain wentworth that perhap he might join them in the evening;
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour
but in thi he wa eagerli oppos by hi wife with oh! no inde
charl i cannot bear to have you go away onli think if anyth
should happen?

the child had a good night and wa go on well the next day
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injuri had been
done to the spine; but mr robinson found noth to increas alarm
and charl musgrov began consequ to feel no necess
for longer confin the child wa to be kept in bed and amus
as quietli as possible; but what wa there for a father to do?
thi wa quit a femal case and it would be highli absurd in him
who could be of no use at home to shut himself up hi father
veri much wish him to meet captain wentworth and there be
no suffici reason against it he ought to go; and it end in hi
make a bold public declar when he came in from shoot
of hi mean to dress directli and dine at the other hous

noth can be go on better than the child said he;
so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me
quit right your sister be with you my love i have no scrupl at all
you would not like to leav him yourself but you see i can be of no use
ann will send for me if anyth is the matter

husband and wive gener understand when opposit will be vain
mari knew from charless manner of speak that he wa
quit determin on go and that it would be of no use to teaz him
she said noth therefor till he wa out of the room
but as soon as there wa onli ann to hear--

so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselv with thi
poor sick child; and not a creatur come near us all the evening!
i knew how it would be thi is alway my luck if there is
anyth disagre go on men are alway sure to get out of it
and charl is as bad as ani of them veri unfeeling! i must say
it is veri unfeel of him to be run away from hi poor littl boy
talk of hi be go on so well! how doe he know that he is
go on well or that there may not be a sudden chang half an hour hence?
i did not think charl would have been so unfeel so here he is to
go away and enjoy himself and becaus i am the poor mother
i am not to be allow to stir; and yet i am sure i am more unfit
than anybodi els to be about the child my be the mother
is the veri reason whi my feel should not be tri i am not at all
equal to it you saw how hyster i wa yesterday

but that wa onli the effect of the sudden of your alarm--
of the shock you will not be hyster again i dare say we shall have
noth to distress us i perfectli understand mr robinson direct
and have no fears; and inde mari i cannot wonder at your husband
nurs doe not belong to a man; it is not hi provinc
a sick child is alway the mother property: her own feel
gener make it so

i hope i am as fond of my child as ani mother but i do not know
that i am of ani more use in the sick-room than charl
for i cannot be alway scold and teaz the poor child when it is ill;
and you saw thi morn that if i told him to keep quiet
he wa sure to begin kick about i have not nerv
for the sort of thing

but could you be comfort yourself to be spend
the whole even away from the poor boy?

yes; you see hi papa can and whi should not i? jemima is so careful;
and she could send us word everi hour how he wa i realli think
charl might as well have told hi father we would all come
i am not more alarm about littl charl now than he is
i wa dread alarm yesterday but the case is veri differ to-day

well if you do not think it too late to give notic for yourself
suppos you were to go as well as your husband leav littl charl
to my care mr and mr musgrov cannot think it wrong while i remain
with him

are you serious? cri mari her eye brighten dear me!
that a veri good thought veri good inde to be sure
i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home--am i?
and it onli harass me you who have not a mother feel
are a great deal the properest person you can make littl charl
do anything; he alway mind you at a word it will be a great deal better
than leav him onli with jemima oh! i shall certainli go;
i am sure i ought if i can quit as much as charl for they want me
excess to be acquaint with captain wentworth and i know
you do not mind be left alon an excel thought of your
inde ann i will go and tell charl and get readi directli
you can send for us you know at a moment notic if anyth
is the matter; but i dare say there will be noth to alarm you
i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quit at eas
about my dear child

the next moment she wa tap at her husband dressing-room door
and as ann follow her up stair she wa in time for
the whole convers which began with mari say
in a tone of great exultation--

i mean to go with you charl for i am of no more use at home
than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child
i should not be abl to persuad him to do anyth he did not like
ann will stay; ann undertak to stay at home and take care of him
it is ann own propos and so i shall go with you which will be
a great deal better for i have not dine at the other hous sinc tuesday

thi is veri kind of ann wa her husband answer and i should be
veri glad to have you go; but it seem rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself to nurs our sick child

ann wa now at hand to take up her own caus and the sincer
of her manner be soon suffici to convinc him where convict
wa at least veri agreeabl he had no farther scrupl as to her be
left to dine alon though he still want her to join them in the even
when the child might be at rest for the night and kindli urg her
to let him come and fetch her but she wa quit unpersuadable;
and thi be the case she had ere long the pleasur of see them
set off togeth in high spirit they were gone she hope
to be happi howev oddli construct such happi might seem;
as for herself she wa left with as mani sensat of comfort
as were perhap ever like to be her she knew herself to be
of the first util to the child; and what wa it to her
if frederick wentworth were onli half a mile distant make himself
agreeabl to others?

she would have like to know how he felt as to a meet
perhap indiffer if indiffer could exist under such circumst
he must be either indiffer or unwil had he wish
ever to see her again he need not have wait till thi time;
he would have done what she could not but believ that in hi place
she should have done long ago when event had been earli give him
the independ which alon had been want

her brother and sister came back delight with their new acquaint
and their visit in gener there had been music sing
talk laugh all that wa most agreeable; charm manner
in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve; they seem all
to know each other perfectli and he wa come the veri next morn
to shoot with charl he wa to come to breakfast but not at the cottag
though that had been propos at first; but then he had been press
to come to the great hous instead and he seem afraid of be
in mr charl musgrov way on account of the child and therefor
somehow they hardli knew how it end in charless be to meet him
to breakfast at hi father

ann understood it he wish to avoid see her he had inquir
after her she found slightli as might suit a former slight acquaint
seem to acknowledg such as she had acknowledg actuat perhap
by the same view of escap introduct when they were to meet

the morn hour of the cottag were alway later than those
of the other hous and on the morrow the differ wa so great
that mari and ann were not more than begin breakfast when
charl came in to say that they were just set off that he wa
come for hi dog that hi sister were follow with captain wentworth;
hi sister mean to visit mari and the child and captain wentworth
propos also to wait on her for a few minut if not inconvenient;
and though charl had answer for the child be in no such state
as could make it inconveni captain wentworth would not be satisfi
without hi run on to give notic

mari veri much gratifi by thi attent wa delight to receiv him
while a thousand feel rush on ann of which thi wa
the most consol that it would soon be over and it wa soon over
in two minut after charless prepar the other appeared;
they were in the drawing-room her eye half met captain wentworth
a bow a curtsey passed; she heard hi voice; he talk to mari
said all that wa right said someth to the miss musgrov
enough to mark an easi footing; the room seem full full of person
and voic but a few minut end it charl shew himself
at the window all wa readi their visitor had bow and wa gone
the miss musgrov were gone too suddenli resolv to walk
to the end of the villag with the sportsmen: the room wa clear
and ann might finish her breakfast as she could

it is over! it is over! she repeat to herself again and again
in nervou gratitud the worst is over!

mari talk but she could not attend she had seen him
they had met they had been onc more in the same room

soon howev she began to reason with herself and tri to be feel less
eight year almost eight year had pass sinc all had been given up
how absurd to be resum the agit which such an interv
had banish into distanc and indistinctness! what might not
eight year do? event of everi descript chang alien
removals--al all must be compris in it and oblivion of the past--
how natur how certain too! it includ nearli a third part
of her own life

alas! with all her reason she found that to retent feel
eight year may be littl more than noth

now how were hi sentiment to be read? wa thi like
wish to avoid her? and the next moment she wa hate herself
for the folli which ask the question

on one other question which perhap her utmost wisdom
might not have prevent she wa soon spare all suspense;
for after the miss musgrov had return and finish their visit
at the cottag she had thi spontan inform from mary: --

captain wentworth is not veri gallant by you ann though he wa
so attent to me henrietta ask him what he thought of you
when they went away and he said `you were so alter he should not
have known you again

mari had no feel to make her respect her sister in a common way
but she wa perfectli unsuspici of be inflict ani peculiar wound

alter beyond hi knowledg ann fulli submit in silent
deep mortif doubtless it wa so and she could take no reveng
for he wa not alter or not for the wors she had alreadi
acknowledg it to herself and she could not think differ
let him think of her as he would no: the year which had destroy
her youth and bloom had onli given him a more glow manli
open look in no respect lessen hi person advantag
she had seen the same frederick wentworth

so alter that he should not have known her again! these were word
which could not but dwell with her yet she soon began to rejoic
that she had heard them they were of sober tendency;
they allay agitation; they compos and consequ must
make her happier

frederick wentworth had use such word or someth like them
but without an idea that they would be carri round to her
he had thought her wretchedli alter and in the first moment of appeal
had spoken as he felt he had not forgiven ann elliot
she had use him ill desert and disappoint him; and wors
she had shewn a feebl of charact in do so which hi own decid
confid temper could not endur she had given him up to oblig other
it had been the effect of over-persuas it had been
weak and timid

he had been most warmli attach to her and had never seen a woman sinc
whom he thought her equal; but except from some natur sensat
of curios he had no desir of meet her again her power with him
wa gone for ever

it wa now hi object to marri he wa rich and be turn on shore
fulli intend to settl as soon as he could be properli tempted;
actual look round readi to fall in love with all the speed
which a clear head and a quick tast could allow he had a heart
for either of the miss musgrov if they could catch it; a heart
in short for ani pleas young woman who came in hi way
except ann elliot thi wa hi onli secret except
when he said to hi sister in answer to her suppositions:--

ye here i am sophia quit readi to make a foolish match
anybodi between fifteen and thirti may have me for ask
a littl beauti and a few smile and a few compliment to the navi
and i am a lost man should not thi be enough for a sailor
who ha had no societi among women to make him nice?

he said it she knew to be contradict hi bright proud eye
spoke the convict that he wa nice; and ann elliot wa
not out of hi thought when he more serious describ
the woman he should wish to meet with a strong mind
with sweet of manner made the first and the last of the descript

that is the woman i want said he someth a littl inferior
i shall of cours put up with but it must not be much if i am a fool
i shall be a fool inde for i have thought on the subject
more than most men



chapter 8


from thi time captain wentworth and ann elliot were repeatedli
in the same circl they were soon dine in compani togeth
at mr musgrov for the littl boy state could no longer
suppli hi aunt with a pretenc for absent herself; and thi wa
but the begin of other dine and other meet

whether former feel were to be renew must be brought to the proof;
former time must undoubtedli be brought to the recollect of each;
they could not but be revert to; the year of their engag
could not but be name by him in the littl narr or descript
which convers call forth hi profess qualifi him
hi disposit lead him to talk; and that wa in the year six;
that happen befor i went to sea in the year six occur
in the cours of the first even they spent together:
and though hi voic did not falter and though she had no reason
to suppos hi eye wander toward her while he spoke
ann felt the utter imposs from her knowledg of hi mind
that he could be unvisit by remembr ani more than herself
there must be the same immedi associ of thought
though she wa veri far from conceiv it to be of equal pain

they had no convers togeth no intercours but what
the commonest civil requir onc so much to each other!
now nothing! there had been a time when of all the larg parti
now fill the drawing-room at uppercross they would have found it
most difficult to ceas to speak to one anoth with the except
perhap of admir and mr croft who seem particularli attach
and happi (ann could allow no other except even among
the marri couples) there could have been no two heart so open
no tast so similar no feel so in unison no counten so belov
now they were as strangers; nay wors than stranger for they could
never becom acquaint it wa a perpetu estrang

when he talk she heard the same voic and discern the same mind
there wa a veri gener ignor of all naval matter throughout the party;
and he wa veri much question and especi by the two miss musgrov
who seem hardli to have ani eye but for him as to the manner
of live on board daili regul food hour &c and their surpris
at hi account at learn the degre of accommod and arrang
which wa practic drew from him some pleasant ridicul
which remind ann of the earli day when she too had been ignor
and she too had been accus of suppos sailor to be live on board
without anyth to eat or ani cook to dress it if there were
or ani servant to wait or ani knife and fork to use

from thu listen and think she wa rous by a whisper
of mr musgrov who overcom by fond regret could not help saying--

ah! miss ann if it had pleas heaven to spare my poor son
i dare say he would have been just such anoth by thi time

ann suppress a smile and listen kindli while mr musgrov
reliev her heart a littl more; and for a few minut therefor
could not keep pace with the convers of the other

when she could let her attent take it natur cours again
she found the miss musgrov just fetch the navi list
(their own navi list the first that had ever been at uppercross)
and sit down togeth to pore over it with the profess view
of find out the ship that captain wentworth had command

your first wa the asp i remember; we will look for the asp

you will not find her there quit worn out and broken up
i wa the last man who command her hardli fit for servic then
report fit for home servic for a year or two and so i wa sent off
to the west indi

the girl look all amaz

the admiralti he continu entertain themselv now and then
with send a few hundr men to sea in a ship not fit to be employ
but they have a great mani to provid for; and among the thousand
that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is imposs
for them to distinguish the veri set who may be least miss

phoo! phoo! cri the admir what stuff these young fellow talk!
never wa a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop
you would not see her equal lucki fellow to get her! he know there
must have been twenti better men than himself appli for her
at the same time lucki fellow to get anyth so soon
with no more interest than hi

i felt my luck admir i assur you; repli captain wentworth
serious i wa as well satisfi with my appoint as you can desir
it wa a great object with me at that time to be at sea;
a veri great object i want to be do someth

to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashor
for half a year together? if a man had not a wife he soon want
to be afloat again

but captain wentworth cri louisa how vex you must have been
when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you

i knew pretti well what she wa befor that day; said he smile
i had no more discoveri to make than you would have as to
the fashion and strength of ani old peliss which you had seen
lent about among half your acquaint ever sinc you could rememb
and which at last on some veri wet day is lent to yourself
ah! she wa a dear old asp to me she did all that i want
i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom togeth
or that she would be the make of me; and i never had two day
of foul weather all the time i wa at sea in her; and after
take privat enough to be veri entertain i had the good luck
in my passag home the next autumn to fall in with the veri french frigat
i want i brought her into plymouth; and here anoth instanc of luck
we had not been six hour in the sound when a gale came on
which last four day and night and which would have done for
poor old asp in half the time; our touch with the great nation
not have much improv our condit four-and-twenti hour later
and i should onli have been a gallant captain wentworth
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and be lost
in onli a sloop nobodi would have thought about me ann shudder
were to herself alone; but the miss musgrov could be as open
as they were sincer in their exclam of piti and horror

and so then i suppos said mr musgrov in a low voic
as if think aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there
he met with our poor boy charl my dear (beckon him to her)
do ask captain wentworth where it wa he first met with your poor brother
i alway forgot

it wa at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar
with a recommend from hi former captain to captain wentworth

oh! but charl tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid
of mention poor dick befor me for it would be rather a pleasur
to hear him talk of by such a good friend

charl be somewhat more mind of the probabl of the case
onli nod in repli and walk away

the girl were now hunt for the laconia; and captain wentworth
could not deni himself the pleasur of take the preciou volum
into hi own hand to save them the troubl and onc more read aloud
the littl statement of her name and rate and present
non-commiss class observ over it that she too had been
one of the best friend man ever had

ah! those were pleasant day when i had the laconia! how fast i
made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a love cruis
togeth off the western island poor harvil sister!
you know how much he want money: wors than myself he had a wife
excel fellow i shall never forget hi happi he felt it all
so much for her sake i wish for him again the next summer
when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean

and i am sure sir said mr musgrov it wa a lucki day for us
when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget
what you did

her feel made her speak low; and captain wentworth
hear onli in part and probabl not have dick musgrov at all
near hi thought look rather in suspens and as if wait for more

my brother whisper one of the girls; mamma is think
of poor richard

poor dear fellow! continu mr musgrove; he wa grown so steadi
and such an excel correspond while he wa under your care!
ah! it would have been a happi thing if he had never left you
i assur you captain wentworth we are veri sorri he ever left you

there wa a momentari express in captain wentworth face at thi speech
a certain glanc of hi bright eye and curl of hi handsom mouth
which convinc ann that instead of share in mr musgrov kind wish
as to her son he had probabl been at some pain to get rid of him;
but it wa too transient an indulg of self-amus to be detect
by ani who understood him less than herself; in anoth moment
he wa perfectli collect and seriou and almost instantli afterward
come up to the sofa on which she and mr musgrov were sit
took a place by the latter and enter into convers with her
in a low voic about her son do it with so much sympathi
and natur grace as shew the kindest consider for all
that wa real and unabsurd in the parent feel

they were actual on the same sofa for mr musgrov had
most readili made room for him; they were divid onli by mr musgrov
it wa no insignific barrier inde mr musgrov wa of
a comfort substanti size infinit more fit by natur
to express good cheer and good humour than tender and sentiment;
and while the agit of ann slender form and pensiv face
may be consid as veri complet screen captain wentworth
should be allow some credit for the self-command with which
he attend to her larg fat sigh over the destini of a son
whom aliv nobodi had care for

person size and mental sorrow have certainli no necessari proport
a larg bulki figur ha as good a right to be in deep afflict
as the most grace set of limb in the world but fair or not fair
there are unbecom conjunct which reason will patron in vain--
which tast cannot tolerate--which ridicul will seiz

the admir after take two or three refresh turn about the room
with hi hand behind him be call to order by hi wife
now came up to captain wentworth and without ani observ
of what he might be interrupt think onli of hi own thought
began with--

if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick
you would have been ask to give a passag to ladi mari grierson
and her daughter

should i? i am glad i wa not a week later then

the admir abus him for hi want of gallantri he defend himself;
though profess that he would never willingli admit ani ladi
on board a ship of hi except for a ball or a visit
which a few hour might comprehend

but if i know myself said he thi is from no want of gallantri
toward them it is rather from feel how imposs it is
with all one effort and all one sacrific to make
the accommod on board such as women ought to have
there can be no want of gallantri admir in rate the claim of women
to everi person comfort high and thi is what i do i hate to hear
of women on board or to see them on board; and no ship under my command
shall ever convey a famili of ladi anywher if i can help it

thi brought hi sister upon him

oh! frederick! but i cannot believ it of you --all idl refinement!
--women may be as comfort on board as in the best hous in england
i believ i have live as much on board as most women and i know
noth superior to the accommod of a man-of-war i declar
i have not a comfort or an indulg about me even at kellynch hall
(with a kind bow to anne) beyond what i alway had in most of
the ship i have live in; and they have been five altogeth

noth to the purpos repli her brother you were live
with your husband and were the onli woman on board

but you yourself brought mr harvil her sister her cousin
and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where wa thi
superfin extraordinari sort of gallantri of your then?

all merg in my friendship sophia i would assist ani
brother offic wife that i could and i would bring anyth
of harvil from the world end if he want it but do not imagin
that i did not feel it an evil in itself

depend upon it they were all perfectli comfort

i might not like them the better for that perhap such a number
of women and children have no right to be comfort on board

my dear frederick you are talk quit idli pray what would
becom of us poor sailor wive who often want to be convey to
one port or anoth after our husband if everybodi had your feelings?

my feel you see did not prevent my take mr harvil
and all her famili to plymouth

but i hate to hear you talk so like a fine gentleman
and as if women were all fine ladi instead of ration creatur
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our day

ah! my dear said the admir when he had got a wife
he will sing a differ tune when he is marri if we have
the good luck to live to anoth war we shall see him do as you and i
and a great mani other have done we shall have him veri thank
to anybodi that will bring him hi wife

ay that we shall

now i have done cri captain wentworth when onc marri
peopl begin to attack me with--`oh! you will think veri differ
when you are marri i can onli say `no i shall not; and then
they say again `ye you will and there is an end of it

he got up and move away

what a great travel you must have been maam! said mr musgrov
to mr croft

pretti well maam in the fifteen year of my marriage;
though mani women have done more i have cross the atlant
four time and have been onc to the east indi and back again
and onli once; besid be in differ place about home:
cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streight
and never wa in the west indi we do not call bermuda or bahama
you know the west indi

mr musgrov had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accus herself
of have ever call them anyth in the whole cours of her life

and i do assur you maam pursu mr croft that noth can exceed
the accommod of a man-of-war; i speak you know of the higher rate
when you come to a frigat of cours you are more confined;
though ani reason woman may be perfectli happi in one of them;
and i can safe say that the happiest part of my life ha been spent
on board a ship while we were togeth you know there wa noth
to be fear thank god! i have alway been bless with
excel health and no climat disagre with me a littl disord
alway the first twenty-four hour of go to sea but never knew
what sick wa afterward the onli time i ever realli suffer
in bodi or mind the onli time that i ever fanci myself unwel
or had ani idea of danger wa the winter that i pass by myself at deal
when the admir (captain croft then) wa in the north sea
i live in perpetu fright at that time and had all manner of
imaginari complaint from not know what to do with myself
or when i should hear from him next; but as long as we could be togeth
noth ever ail me and i never met with the smallest inconveni

aye to be sure ye inde oh yes! i am quit of your opinion
mr croft wa mr musgrov hearti answer there is noth so bad
as a separ i am quit of your opinion i know what it is
for mr musgrov alway attend the assiz and i am so glad when
they are over and he is safe back again

the even end with danc on it be propos
ann offer her servic as usual; and though her eye would sometim
fill with tear as she sat at the instrument she wa extrem glad
to be employ and desir noth in return but to be unobserv

it wa a merri joyou parti and no one seem in higher spirit
than captain wentworth she felt that he had everi thing to elev
him which gener attent and defer and especi the attent
of all the young women could do the miss hayter the femal
of the famili of cousin alreadi mention were appar admit
to the honour of be in love with him; and as for henrietta and louisa
they both seem so entir occupi by him that noth but
the continu appear of the most perfect good-wil between themselv
could have made it credibl that they were not decid rival
if he were a littl spoilt by such univers such eager admir
who could wonder?

these were some of the thought which occupi ann while her finger
were mechan at work proceed for half an hour togeth
equal without error and without conscious onc she felt
that he wa look at herself observ her alter featur
perhap tri to trace in them the ruin of the face which had onc
charm him; and onc she knew that he must have spoken of her;
she wa hardli awar of it till she heard the answer; but then she wa
sure of hi have ask hi partner whether miss elliot never danced?
the answer wa oh no; never; she ha quit given up danc
she had rather play she is never tire of play onc too
he spoke to her she had left the instrument on the danc be over
and he had sat down to tri to make out an air which he wish
to give the miss musgrov an idea of unintent she return
to that part of the room; he saw her and instantli rise
said with studi politeness--

i beg your pardon madam thi is your seat; and though she immedi
drew back with a decid neg he wa not to be induc
to sit down again

ann did not wish for more of such look and speech
hi cold polit hi ceremoni grace were wors than anyth



chapter 9


captain wentworth wa come to kellynch as to a home to stay
as long as he like be as thoroughli the object of
the admir fratern kind as of hi wife he had intend
on first arriv to proceed veri soon into shropshir
and visit the brother settl in that countri but the attract
of uppercross induc him to put thi off there wa so much
of friendli and of flatteri and of everyth most bewitch
in hi recept there; the old were so hospit the young so agreeabl
that he could not but resolv to remain where he wa and take all
the charm and perfect of edward wife upon credit a littl longer

it wa soon uppercross with him almost everi day the musgrov
could hardli be more readi to invit than he to come particularli
in the morn when he had no companion at home for the admir
and mr croft were gener out of door togeth interest themselv
in their new possess their grass and their sheep and dawdl about
in a way not endur to a third person or drive out in a gig
late ad to their establish

hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth
among the musgrov and their depend it wa unvari
warm admir everywhere; but thi intim foot wa not more
than establish when a certain charl hayter return among them
to be a good deal disturb by it and to think captain wentworth
veri much in the way

charl hayter wa the eldest of all the cousin and a veri amiabl
pleas young man between whom and henrietta there had been
a consider appear of attach previou to captain wentworth
introduct he wa in orders; and have a curaci in the neighbourhood
where resid wa not requir live at hi father hous
onli two mile from uppercross a short absenc from home
had left hi fair one unguard by hi attent at thi critic period
and when he came back he had the pain of find veri alter manner
and of see captain wentworth

mr musgrov and mr hayter were sister they had each had money
but their marriag had made a materi differ in
their degre of consequ mr hayter had some properti of hi own
but it wa insignific compar with mr musgroves; and while
the musgrov were in the first class of societi in the countri
the young hayter would from their parent inferior retir
and unpolish way of live and their own defect educ
have been hardli in ani class at all but for their connexion
with uppercross thi eldest son of cours except who had chosen
to be a scholar and a gentleman and who wa veri superior
in cultiv and manner to all the rest

the two famili had alway been on excel term there be no pride
on one side and no envi on the other and onli such a conscious
of superior in the miss musgrov as made them pleas
to improv their cousin charless attent to henrietta
had been observ by her father and mother without ani disapprob
it would not be a great match for her; but if henrietta like him--
and henrietta did seem to like him

henrietta fulli thought so herself befor captain wentworth came;
but from that time cousin charl had been veri much forgotten

which of the two sister wa prefer by captain wentworth wa
as yet quit doubt as far as ann observ reach
henrietta wa perhap the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits;
and she knew not now whether the more gentl or the more live charact
were most like to attract him

mr and mr musgrov either from see littl or from
an entir confid in the discret of both their daughter
and of all the young men who came near them seem to leav everyth
to take it chanc there wa not the smallest appear of solicitud
or remark about them in the mansion-house; but it wa differ
at the cottage: the young coupl there were more dispos
to specul and wonder; and captain wentworth had not been abov
four or five time in the miss musgrov compani and charl hayter
had but just reappear when ann had to listen to the opinion
of her brother and sister as to which wa the one like best
charl gave it for louisa mari for henrietta but quit agre
that to have him marri either could be extrem delight

charl had never seen a pleasant man in hi life; and from what
he had onc heard captain wentworth himself say wa veri sure that
he had not made less than twenti thousand pound by the war
here wa a fortun at once; besid which there would be the chanc
of what might be done in ani futur war; and he wa sure captain wentworth
wa as like a man to distinguish himself as ani offic in the navi
oh! it would be a capit match for either of hi sister

upon my word it would repli mari dear me! if he should
rise to ani veri great honours! if he should ever be made a baronet!
`ladi wentworth sound veri well that would be a nobl thing
inde for henrietta! she would take place of me then and henrietta
would not dislik that sir frederick and ladi wentworth!
it would be but a new creation howev and i never think much
of your new creation

it suit mari best to think henrietta the one prefer
on the veri account of charl hayter whose pretens she wish
to see put an end to she look down veri decidedli upon the hayter
and thought it would be quit a misfortun to have the exist connect
between the famili renewed--veri sad for herself and her children

you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta;
and consid the allianc which the musgrov have made
she ha no right to throw herself away i do not think ani young woman
ha a right to make a choic that may be disagre and inconveni
to the princip part of her famili and be give bad connect
to those who have not been use to them and pray who is charl hayter?
noth but a countri curat a most improp match for miss musgrov
of uppercross

her husband howev would not agre with her here; for besid have
a regard for hi cousin charl hayter wa an eldest son
and he saw thing as an eldest son himself

now you are take nonsens mari wa therefor hi answer
it would not be a great match for henrietta but charl ha
a veri fair chanc through the spicer of get someth from
the bishop in the cours of a year or two; and you will pleas to rememb
that he is the eldest son; whenev my uncl die he step into veri
pretti properti the estat at winthrop is not less than
two hundr and fifti acr besid the farm near taunton
which is some of the best land in the countri i grant you
that ani of them but charl would be a veri shock match for henrietta
and inde it could not be; he is the onli one that could be possible;
but he is a veri good-natur good sort of a fellow; and whenev winthrop
come into hi hand he will make a differ sort of place of it
and live in a veri differ sort of way; and with that properti
he will never be a contempt man--good freehold properti no no;
henrietta might do wors than marri charl hayter; and if she ha him
and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be veri well satisfi

charl may say what he pleas cri mari to ann as soon as
he wa out of the room but it would be shock to have henrietta
marri charl hayter; a veri bad thing for her and still wors
for me; and therefor it is veri much to be wish that captain wentworth
may soon put him quit out of her head and i have veri littl doubt
that he ha she took hardli ani notic of charl hayter yesterday
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to
captain wentworth like louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsens
to say so; for he certainli doe like henrietta a great deal the best
but charl is so positive! i wish you had been with us yesterday
for then you might have decid between us; and i am sure you
would have thought as i did unless you had been determin
to give it against me

a dinner at mr musgrov had been the occas when all these thing
should have been seen by anne; but she had staid at home
under the mix plea of a headach of her own and some return
of indisposit in littl charl she had thought onli of avoid
captain wentworth; but an escap from be appeal to as umpir
wa now ad to the advantag of a quiet even

as to captain wentworth view she deem it of more consequ
that he should know hi own mind earli enough not to be endang
the happi of either sister or impeach hi own honour
than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta
either of them would in all probabl make him an affection
good-humour wife with regard to charl hayter she had delicaci
which must be pain by ani light of conduct in a well-mean
young woman and a heart to sympath in ani of the suffer
it occasioned; but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the natur
of her feel the altern could not be understood too soon

charl hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortifi him
in hi cousin behaviour she had too old a regard for him
to be so wholli estrang as might in two meet extinguish
everi past hope and leav him noth to do but to keep away
from uppercross: but there wa such a chang as becam veri alarm
when such a man as captain wentworth wa to be regard as
the probabl caus he had been absent onli two sunday
and when they part had left her interest even to the height
of hi wish in hi prospect of soon quit hi present curaci
and obtain that of uppercross instead it had then seem the object
nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than
forti year had been zealous discharg all the duti of hi offic
but wa now grow too infirm for mani of them should be quit fix
on engag a curate; should make hi curaci quit as good
as he could afford and should give charl hayter the promis of it
the advantag of hi have to come onli to uppercross instead of go
six mile anoth way; of hi have in everi respect a better curacy;
of hi belong to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley
be reliev from the duti which he could no longer get through
without most injuri fatigu had been a great deal even to louisa
but had been almost everyth to henrietta when he came back alas!
the zeal of the busi wa gone by louisa could not listen at all
to hi account of a convers which he had just held with dr shirley:
she wa at a window look out for captain wentworth; and even henrietta
had at best onli a divid attent to give and seem to have forgotten
all the former doubt and solicitud of the negoti

well i am veri glad indeed: but i alway thought you would have it;
i alway thought you sure it did not appear to me that--in short
you know dr shirley must have a curat and you had secur hi promis
is he come louisa?

one morn veri soon after the dinner at the musgrov
at which ann had not been present captain wentworth walk into
the drawing-room at the cottag where were onli herself and the littl
invalid charl who wa lie on the sofa

the surpris of find himself almost alon with ann elliot
depriv hi manner of their usual composure: he start
and could onli say i thought the miss musgrov had been here:
mr musgrov told me i should find them here befor he walk
to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behav

they are up stair with my sister: they will be down in a few moment
i dare say had been ann repli in all the confus that wa natural;
and if the child had not call her to come and do someth for him
she would have been out of the room the next moment and releas
captain wentworth as well as herself

he continu at the window; and after calmli and polit say
i hope the littl boy is better wa silent

she wa oblig to kneel down by the sofa and remain there
to satisfi her patient; and thu they continu a few minut
when to her veri great satisfact she heard some other person
cross the littl vestibul she hope on turn her head
to see the master of the house; but it prove to be one
much less calcul for make matter easy--charl hayter
probabl not at all better pleas by the sight of captain wentworth
than captain wentworth had been by the sight of ann

she onli attempt to say how do you do? will you not sit down?
the other will be here present

captain wentworth howev came from hi window appar
not ill-dispos for conversation; but charl hayter soon put an end
to hi attempt by seat himself near the tabl and take up
the newspaper; and captain wentworth return to hi window

anoth minut brought anoth addit the younger boy
a remark stout forward child of two year old have got the door
open for him by some one without made hi determin appear
among them and went straight to the sofa to see what wa go on
and put in hi claim to anyth good that might be give away

there be noth to eat he could onli have some play;
and as hi aunt would not let him teas hi sick brother
he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that
busi as she wa about charl she could not shake him off
she spoke to him order entreat and insist in vain
onc she did contriv to push him away but the boy had
the greater pleasur in get upon her back again directli

walter said she get down thi moment you are extrem troublesom
i am veri angri with you

walter cri charl hayter whi do you not do as you are bid?
do not you hear your aunt speak? come to me walter come to
cousin charl

but not a bit did walter stir

in anoth moment howev she found herself in the state of
be releas from him; some one wa take him from her
though he had bent down her head so much that hi littl sturdi hand
were unfasten from around her neck and he wa resolut born away
befor she knew that captain wentworth had done it

her sensat on the discoveri made her perfectli speechless
she could not even thank him she could onli hang over littl charl
with most disord feel hi kind in step forward
to her relief the manner the silenc in which it had pass
the littl particular of the circumst with the convict soon
forc on her by the nois he wa studious make with the child
that he meant to avoid hear her thank and rather sought
to testifi that her convers wa the last of hi want
produc such a confus of vari but veri pain agit
as she could not recov from till enabl by the entranc of mari
and the miss musgrov to make over her littl patient to their care
and leav the room she could not stay it might have been
an opportun of watch the love and jealousi of the four--
they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it
it wa evid that charl hayter wa not well inclin toward
captain wentworth she had a strong impress of hi have said
in a vext tone of voic after captain wentworth interfer
you ought to have mind me walter; i told you not to teaz your aunt;
and could comprehend hi regret that captain wentworth should do
what he ought to have done himself but neither charl hayter feel
nor anybodi feel could interest her till she had a littl better
arrang her own she wa asham of herself quit asham
of be so nervou so overcom by such a trifle; but so it wa
and it requir a long applic of solitud and reflect
to recov her



chapter 10


other opportun of make her observ could not fail to occur
ann had soon been in compani with all the four togeth often enough
to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledg as much at home
where she knew it would have satisfi neither husband nor wife;
for while she consid louisa to be rather the favourit
she could not but think as far as she might dare to judg from memori
and experi that captain wentworth wa not in love with either
they were more in love with him; yet there it wa not love
it wa a littl fever of admiration; but it might probabl must
end in love with some charl hayter seem awar of be slight
and yet henrietta had sometim the air of be divid between them
ann long for the power of repres to them all what they were about
and of point out some of the evil they were expos themselv to
she did not attribut guil to ani it wa the highest satisfact
to her to believ captain wentworth not in the least awar
of the pain he wa occas there wa no triumph no piti triumph
in hi manner he had probabl never heard and never thought of
ani claim of charl hayter he wa onli wrong in accept
the attent (for accept must be the word) of two young women at onc

after a short struggl howev charl hayter seem to quit the field
three day had pass without hi come onc to uppercross;
a most decid chang he had even refus one regular invit to dinner;
and have been found on the occas by mr musgrov with some larg book
befor him mr and mr musgrov were sure all could not be right
and talk with grave face of hi studi himself to death
it wa mari hope and belief that he had receiv a posit dismiss
from henrietta and her husband live under the constant depend
of see him to-morrow ann could onli feel that charl hayter
wa wise

one morn about thi time charl musgrov and captain wentworth
be gone a-shoot togeth as the sister in the cottag
were sit quietli at work they were visit at the window
by the sister from the mansion-hous

it wa a veri fine novemb day and the miss musgrov came
through the littl ground and stop for no other purpos than to say
that they were go to take a long walk and therefor conclud
mari could not like to go with them; and when mari immedi repli
with some jealousi at not be suppos a good walker oh ye
i should like to join you veri much i am veri fond of a long walk;
ann felt persuad by the look of the two girl that it wa precis
what they did not wish and admir again the sort of necess
which the famili habit seem to produc of everyth be
to be commun and everyth be to be done togeth
howev undesir and inconveni she tri to dissuad mari from go
but in vain; and that be the case thought it best to accept
the miss musgrov much more cordial invit to herself to go likewis
as she might be use in turn back with her sister and lessen
the interfer in ani plan of their own

i cannot imagin whi they should suppos i should not like a long walk
said mari as she went up stair everybodi is alway suppos
that i am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleas
if we had refus to join them when peopl come in thi manner
on purpos to ask us how can one say no?

just as they were set off the gentlemen return they had taken out
a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back earli
their time and strength and spirit were therefor exactli readi
for thi walk and they enter into it with pleasur could ann
have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home; but
from some feel of interest and curios she fanci now that it wa
too late to retract and the whole six set forward togeth
in the direct chosen by the miss musgrov who evid
consid the walk as under their guidanc

ann object wa not to be in the way of anybody; and where
the narrow path across the field made mani separ necessari
to keep with her brother and sister her pleasur in the walk
must aris from the exercis and the day from the view of
the last smile of the year upon the tawni leav and wither hedg
and from repeat to herself some few of the thousand poetic
descript extant of autumn that season of peculiar and
inexhaust influenc on the mind of tast and tender
that season which had drawn from everi poet worthi of be read
some attempt at descript or some line of feel
she occupi her mind as much as possibl in such like muse
and quotations; but it wa not possibl that when within reach
of captain wentworth convers with either of the miss musgrov
she should not tri to hear it; yet she caught littl veri remark
it wa mere live chat such as ani young person on an intim foot
might fall into he wa more engag with louisa than with henrietta
louisa certainli put more forward for hi notic than her sister
thi distinct appear to increas and there wa one speech
of louisa which struck her after one of the mani prais of the day
which were continu burst forth captain wentworth added: --

what gloriou weather for the admir and my sister! they meant to take
a long drive thi morning; perhap we may hail them from
some of these hill they talk of come into thi side of the countri
i wonder whereabout they will upset to-day oh! it doe happen
veri often i assur you; but my sister make noth of it;
she would as liev be toss out as not

ah! you make the most of it i know cri louisa but if it were
realli so i should do just the same in her place if i love a man
as she love the admir i would alway be with him noth should ever
separ us and i would rather be overturn by him than driven safe
by anybodi els

it wa spoken with enthusiasm

had you? cri he catch the same tone; i honour you!
and there wa silenc between them for a littl while

ann could not immedi fall into a quotat again the sweet scene
of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet
fraught with the apt analog of the declin year with declin
happi and the imag of youth and hope and spring all gone togeth
bless her memori she rous herself to say as they struck by order
into anoth path is not thi one of the way to winthrop?
but nobodi heard or at least nobodi answer her

winthrop howev or it environs--for young men are sometim
to be met with stroll about near home--wa their destination;
and after anoth half mile of gradual ascent through larg enclosur
where the plough at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer
counteract the sweet of poetic despond and mean
to have spring again they gain the summit of the most consider hill
which part uppercross and winthrop and soon command a full view
of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side

winthrop without beauti and without digniti wa stretch befor them
an indiffer hous stand low and hem in by the barn and
build of a farm-yard

mari exclaim bless me! here is winthrop i declar i had no idea!
well now i think we had better turn back; i am excess tire

henrietta consciou and asham and see no cousin charl
walk along ani path or lean against ani gate wa readi
to do as mari wished; but no! said charl musgrov and no no!
cri louisa more eagerli and take her sister asid seem to be
argu the matter warmli

charl in the meanwhil wa veri decidedli declar hi resolut
of call on hi aunt now that he wa so near; and veri evid
though more fear tri to induc hi wife to go too
but thi wa one of the point on which the ladi shew her strength;
and when he recommend the advantag of rest herself a quarter
of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tire she resolut answer
oh! no indeed! walk up that hill again would do her more harm
than ani sit down could do her good; and in short
her look and manner declar that go she would not

after a littl success of these sort of debat and consult
it wa settl between charl and hi two sister that he
and henrietta should just run down for a few minut to see their aunt
and cousin while the rest of the parti wait for them at the top
of the hill louisa seem the princip arrang of the plan;
and as she went a littl way with them down the hill still talk
to henrietta mari took the opportun of look scorn around her
and say to captain wentworth--

it is veri unpleas have such connexions! but i assur you
i have never been in the hous abov twice in my life

she receiv no other answer than an artifici assent smile
follow by a contemptu glanc as he turn away which ann
perfectli knew the mean of

the brow of the hill where they remain wa a cheer spot:
louisa returned; and mari find a comfort seat for herself
on the step of a stile wa veri well satisfi so long as the other
all stood about her; but when louisa drew captain wentworth away
to tri for a glean of nut in an adjoin hedge-row
and they were gone by degre quit out of sight and sound
mari wa happi no longer; she quarrel with her own seat
wa sure louisa had got a much better somewher and noth could
prevent her from go to look for a better also she turn through
the same gate but could not see them ann found a nice seat
for her on a dri sunni bank under the hedge-row in which
she had no doubt of their still be in some spot or other
mari sat down for a moment but it would not do; she wa sure louisa
had found a better seat somewher els and she would go on
till she overtook her

ann realli tire herself wa glad to sit down; and she veri soon heard
captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row behind her as if
make their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the
centr they were speak as they drew near louisa voic wa
the first distinguish she seem to be in the middl of some
eager speech what ann first heard was--

and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frighten
from the visit by such nonsens what! would i be turn back from
do a thing that i had determin to do and that i knew to be right
by the air and interfer of such a person or of ani person i may say?
no i have no idea of be so easili persuad when i have
made up my mind i have made it; and henrietta seem entir
to have made up her to call at winthrop to-day; and yet she wa as near
give it up out of nonsens complaisance!

she would have turn back then but for you?

she would inde i am almost asham to say it

happi for her to have such a mind as your at hand! after the hint
you gave just now which did but confirm my own observ
the last time i wa in compani with him i need not affect
to have no comprehens of what is go on i see that more than
a mere duti morn visit to your aunt wa in question;
and woe betid him and her too when it come to thing of consequ
when they are place in circumst requir fortitud and
strength of mind if she have not resolut enough to resist
idl interfer in such a trifl as thi your sister is
an amiabl creature; but your is the charact of decis and firm
i see if you valu her conduct or happi infus as much
of your own spirit into her as you can but thi no doubt
you have been alway do it is the worst evil of too yield
and indecis a charact that no influenc over it can be depend on
you are never sure of a good impress be durable; everybodi
may sway it let those who would be happi be firm here is a nut
said he catch one down from an upper bough to exemplify:
a beauti glossi nut which bless with origin strength
ha outliv all the storm of autumn not a punctur not
a weak spot anywher thi nut he continu with play solemn
while so mani of hi brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot
is still in possess of all the happi that a hazel nut can be
suppos capabl of then return to hi former earnest tone--
my first wish for all whom i am interest in is that they should be firm
if louisa musgrov would be beauti and happi in her novemb of life
she will cherish all her present power of mind

he had done and wa unansw it would have surpris ann if louisa
could have readili answer such a speech: word of such interest
spoken with such seriou warmth! she could imagin what louisa wa feel
for herself she fear to move lest she should be seen
while she remain a bush of low rambl holli protect her
and they were move on befor they were beyond her hear
howev louisa spoke again

mari is good-natur enough in mani respect said she;
but she doe sometim provok me excess by her nonsens
and pride--th elliot pride she ha a great deal too much
of the elliot pride we do so wish that charl had marri ann instead
i suppos you know he want to marri anne?

after a moment paus captain wentworth said--

do you mean that she refus him?

oh! yes; certainli

when did that happen?

i do not exactli know for henrietta and i were at school at the time;
but i believ about a year befor he marri mari i wish she had
accept him we should all have like her a great deal better;
and papa and mamma alway think it wa her great friend
ladi russel do that she did not they think charl
might not be learn and bookish enough to pleas ladi russel
and that therefor she persuad ann to refus him

the sound were retreat and ann distinguish no more
her own emot still kept her fix she had much to recov from
befor she could move the listen proverbi fate wa
not absolut hers; she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard
a great deal of veri pain import she saw how her own charact
wa consid by captain wentworth and there had been just that degre
of feel and curios about her in hi manner which must give her
extrem agit

as soon as she could she went after mari and have found
and walk back with her to their former station by the stile
felt some comfort in their whole parti be immedi afterward
collect and onc more in motion togeth her spirit want
the solitud and silenc which onli number could give

charl and henrietta return bring as may be conjectur
charl hayter with them the minutia of the busi ann
could not attempt to understand; even captain wentworth did not seem
admit to perfect confid here; but that there had been a withdraw
on the gentleman side and a relent on the ladi and that they
were now veri glad to be togeth again did not admit a doubt
henrietta look a littl asham but veri well pleased;--
charl hayter exceedingli happy: and they were devot to each other
almost from the first instant of their all set forward for uppercross

everyth now mark out louisa for captain wentworth;
noth could be plainer; and where mani divis were necessari
or even where they were not they walk side by side nearli as much
as the other two in a long strip of meadow land where there wa
ampl space for all they were thu divid form three distinct parties;
and to that parti of the three which boast least anim
and least complais ann necessarili belong she join charl
and mari and wa tire enough to be veri glad of charless other arm;
but charl though in veri good humour with her wa out of temper
with hi wife mari had shewn herself disoblig to him
and wa now to reap the consequ which consequ wa
hi drop her arm almost everi moment to cut off the head
of some nettl in the hedg with hi switch; and when mari began
to complain of it and lament her be ill-us accord to custom
in be on the hedg side while ann wa never incommod on the other
he drop the arm of both to hunt after a weasel which he had
a momentari glanc of and they could hardli get him along at all

thi long meadow border a lane which their footpath at the end of it
wa to cross and when the parti had all reach the gate of exit
the carriag advanc in the same direct which had been
some time heard wa just come up and prove to be admir croft gig
he and hi wife had taken their intend drive and were return home
upon hear how long a walk the young peopl had engag in
they kindli offer a seat to ani ladi who might be particularli tired;
it would save her a full mile and they were go through uppercross
the invit wa gener and gener declin the miss musgrov
were not at all tire and mari wa either offend by not be ask
befor ani of the other or what louisa call the elliot pride
could not endur to make a third in a one hors chais

the walk parti had cross the lane and were surmount an
opposit stile and the admir wa put hi hors in motion again
when captain wentworth clear the hedg in a moment to say someth
to hi sister the someth might be guess by it effect

miss elliot i am sure you are tire cri mr croft
do let us have the pleasur of take you home here is excel room
for three i assur you if we were all like you i believ we might
sit four you must inde you must

ann wa still in the lane; and though instinct begin to declin
she wa not allow to proceed the admir kind urgenc
came in support of hi wifes; they would not be refused;
they compress themselv into the smallest possibl space
to leav her a corner and captain wentworth without say a word
turn to her and quietli oblig her to be assist into the carriag

yes; he had done it she wa in the carriag and felt that he had
place her there that hi will and hi hand had done it
that she owe it to hi percept of her fatigu and hi resolut
to give her rest she wa veri much affect by the view of
hi disposit toward her which all these thing made appar
thi littl circumst seem the complet of all that had gone befor
she understood him he could not forgiv her but he could not
be unfeel though condemn her for the past and consid it
with high and unjust resent though perfectli careless of her
and though becom attach to anoth still he could not see her suffer
without the desir of give her relief it wa a remaind
of former sentiment; it wa an impuls of pure though unacknowledg
friendship; it wa a proof of hi own warm and amiabl heart
which she could not contempl without emot so compound
of pleasur and pain that she knew not which prevail

her answer to the kind and the remark of her companion
were at first unconsci given they had travel half their way
along the rough lane befor she wa quit awak to what they said
she then found them talk of frederick

he certainli mean to have one or other of those two girl sophi
said the admiral; but there is no say which he ha been
run after them too long enough one would think to make up hi mind
ay thi come of the peac if it were war now he would have
settl it long ago we sailor miss elliot cannot afford to make
long courtship in time of war how mani day wa it my dear
between the first time of my see you and our sit down togeth
in our lodg at north yarmouth?

we had better not talk about it my dear repli mr croft pleasantly;
for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understand
she would never be persuad that we could be happi togeth
i had known you by charact howev long befor

well and i had heard of you as a veri pretti girl and what were we
to wait for besides? i do not like have such thing so long in hand
i wish frederick would spread a littl more canvass and bring us home
one of these young ladi to kellynch then there would alway
be compani for them and veri nice young ladi they both are;
i hardli know one from the other

veri good humour unaffect girl inde said mr croft
in a tone of calmer prais such as made ann suspect that
her keener power might not consid either of them as quit worthi
of her brother; and a veri respect famili one could not be
connect with better peopl my dear admir that post!
we shall certainli take that post

but by coolli give the rein a better direct herself they happili
pass the danger; and by onc afterward judici put out
her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung-cart;
and ann with some amus at their style of drive
which she imagin no bad represent of the gener guidanc
of their affair found herself safe deposit by them at the cottag



chapter 11


the time now approach for ladi russel return: the day wa even fixed;
and ann be engag to join her as soon as she wa resettl
wa look forward to an earli remov to kellynch and begin
to think how her own comfort wa like to be affect by it

it would place her in the same villag with captain wentworth
within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church
and there must be intercours between the two famili
thi wa against her; but on the other hand he spent so much of hi time
at uppercross that in remov thenc she might be consid rather
as leav him behind than as go toward him; and upon the whole
she believ she must on thi interest question be the gainer
almost as certainli as in her chang of domest societi
in leav poor mari for ladi russel

she wish it might be possibl for her to avoid ever see
captain wentworth at the hall: those room had wit
former meet which would be brought too pain befor her;
but she wa yet more anxiou for the possibl of ladi russel and
captain wentworth never meet anywher they did not like each other
and no renew of acquaint now could do ani good; and were ladi russel
to see them togeth she might think that he had too much self-possess
and she too littl

these point form her chief solicitud in anticip
her remov from uppercross where she felt she had been station
quit long enough her use to littl charl would alway
give some sweet to the memori of her two month visit there
but he wa gain strength apac and she had noth els to stay for

the conclus of her visit howev wa diversifi in a way
which she had not at all imagin captain wentworth after be unseen
and unheard of at uppercross for two whole day appear again among them
to justifi himself by a relat of what had kept him away

a letter from hi friend captain harvil have found him out at last
had brought intellig of captain harvil be settl
with hi famili at lyme for the winter; of their be therefor
quit unknowingli within twenti mile of each other captain harvil
had never been in good health sinc a sever wound which he receiv
two year befor and captain wentworth anxieti to see him
had determin him to go immedi to lyme he had been there
for four-and-twenti hour hi acquitt wa complet
hi friendship warmli honour a live interest excit for hi friend
and hi descript of the fine countri about lyme so feelingli attend to
by the parti that an earnest desir to see lyme themselv
and a project for go thither wa the consequ

the young peopl were all wild to see lyme captain wentworth talk
of go there again himself it wa onli seventeen mile from uppercross;
though novemb the weather wa by no mean bad; and in short
louisa who wa the most eager of the eager have form
the resolut to go and besid the pleasur of do as she like
be now arm with the idea of merit in maintain her own way
bore down all the wish of her father and mother for put it off
till summer; and to lyme they were to go--charl mari ann henrietta
louisa and captain wentworth

the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morn and return at night;
but to thi mr musgrov for the sake of hi hors would not consent;
and when it came to be ration consid a day in
the middl of novemb would not leav much time for see a new place
after deduct seven hour as the natur of the countri requir
for go and return they were consequ to stay the night there
and not to be expect back till the next day dinner thi wa felt
to be a consider amendment; and though they all met at the great hous
at rather an earli breakfast hour and set off veri punctual
it wa so much past noon befor the two carriag mr musgrov coach
contain the four ladi and charless curricl in which
he drove captain wentworth were descend the long hill into lyme
and enter upon the still steeper street of the town itself
that it wa veri evid they would not have more than time
for look about them befor the light and warmth of the day were gone

after secur accommod and order a dinner at one of the inn
the next thing to be done wa unquestion to walk directli
down to the sea they were come too late in the year for ani amus
or varieti which lyme as a public place might offer the room
were shut up the lodger almost all gone scarc ani famili
but of the resid left; and as there is noth to admir
in the build themselv the remark situat of the town
the princip street almost hurri into the water the walk to the cobb
skirt round the pleasant littl bay which in the season
is anim with bath machin and company; the cobb itself
it old wonder and new improv with the veri beauti
line of cliff stretch out to the east of the town are what
the stranger eye will seek; and a veri strang stranger it must be
who doe not see charm in the immedi environ of lyme
to make him wish to know it better the scene in it neighbourhood
charmouth with it high ground and extens sweep of countri
and still more it sweet retir bay back by dark cliff
where fragment of low rock among the sand make it the happiest spot
for watch the flow of the tide for sit in unweari contemplation;
the woodi varieti of the cheer villag of up lyme; and abov all
pinni with it green chasm between romant rock where
the scatter forest tree and orchard of luxuri growth
declar that mani a gener must have pass away sinc the first
partial fall of the cliff prepar the ground for such a state
where a scene so wonder and so love is exhibit as may
more than equal ani of the resembl scene of the far-fam
isl of wight: these place must be visit and visit again
to make the worth of lyme understood

the parti from uppercross pass down by the now desert
and melancholi look room and still descend soon found themselv
on the sea-shore; and linger onli as all must linger and gaze
on a first return to the sea who ever deserv to look on it at all
proceed toward the cobb equal their object in itself
and on captain wentworth account: for in a small hous
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvil settl
captain wentworth turn in to call on hi friend; the other walk on
and he wa to join them on the cobb

they were by no mean tire of wonder and admiring; and not even louisa
seem to feel that they had part with captain wentworth long
when they saw him come after them with three companion
all well known alreadi by descript to be captain and mr harvil
and a captain benwick who wa stay with them

captain benwick had some time ago been first lieuten of the laconia;
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him
on hi return from lyme befor hi warm prais of him as
an excel young man and an offic whom he had alway valu highli
which must have stamp him well in the esteem of everi listen
had been follow by a littl histori of hi privat life
which render him perfectli interest in the eye of all the ladi
he had been engag to captain harvil sister and wa now
mourn her loss they had been a year or two wait for fortun
and promot fortun came hi prize-money as lieuten be great;
promot too came at last; but fanni harvil did not live to know it
she had die the preced summer while he wa at sea captain wentworth
believ it imposs for man to be more attach to woman
than poor benwick had been to fanni harvil or to be more deepli
afflict under the dread chang he consid hi disposit
as of the sort which must suffer heavili unit veri strong feel
with quiet seriou and retir manner and a decid tast for read
and sedentari pursuit to finish the interest of the stori
the friendship between him and the harvil seem if possibl
augment by the event which close all their view of allianc
and captain benwick wa now live with them entir captain harvil
had taken hi present hous for half a year; hi tast and hi health
and hi fortun all direct him to a resid inexpens
and by the sea; and the grandeur of the countri and the retir
of lyme in the winter appear exactli adapt to captain benwick
state of mind the sympathi and good-wil excit toward captain benwick
wa veri great

and yet said ann to herself as they now move forward
to meet the parti he ha not perhap a more sorrow heart
than i have i cannot believ hi prospect so blight for ever
he is younger than i am; younger in feel if not in fact;
younger as a man he will ralli again and be happi with anoth

they all met and were introduc captain harvil wa a tall
dark man with a sensibl benevol countenance; a littl lame;
and from strong featur and want of health look much older
than captain wentworth captain benwick look and wa
the youngest of the three and compar with either of them
a littl man he had a pleas face and a melancholi air
just as he ought to have and drew back from convers

captain harvil though not equal captain wentworth in manner
wa a perfect gentleman unaffect warm and oblig
mr harvil a degre less polish than her husband seem howev
to have the same good feelings; and noth could be more pleasant
than their desir of consid the whole parti as friend of their own
becaus the friend of captain wentworth or more kindli hospit
than their entreati for their all promis to dine with them
the dinner alreadi order at the inn wa at last though unwillingli
accept as a excuse; but they seem almost hurt that captain wentworth
should have brought ani such parti to lyme without consid it
as a thing of cours that they should dine with them

there wa so much attach to captain wentworth in all thi
and such a bewitch charm in a degre of hospit so uncommon
so unlik the usual style of give-and-tak invit and dinner
of formal and display that ann felt her spirit not like to be
benefit by an increas acquaint among hi brother-offic
these would have been all my friend wa her thought;
and she had to struggl against a great tendenc to low

on quit the cobb they all went in-door with their new friend
and found room so small as none but those who invit from the heart
could think capabl of accommod so mani ann had
a moment astonish on the subject herself; but it wa soon lost
in the pleasant feel which sprang from the sight of all
the ingeni contriv and nice arrang of captain harvil
to turn the actual space to the best account to suppli the defici
of lodging-hous furnitur and defend the window and door
against the winter storm to be expect the varieti in
the fitting-up of the room where the common necessari
provid by the owner in the common indiffer plight
were contrast with some few articl of a rare speci of wood
excel work up and with someth curiou and valuabl
from all the distant countri captain harvil had visit
were more than amus to anne; connect as it all wa with hi profess
the fruit of it labour the effect of it influenc on hi habit
the pictur of repos and domest happi it present
made it to her a someth more or less than gratif

captain harvil wa no reader; but he had contriv
excel accommod and fashion veri pretti shelv
for a toler collect of well-bound volum the properti of
captain benwick hi lame prevent him from take much exercise;
but a mind of use and ingenu seem to furnish him with
constant employ within he drew he varnish he carpent
he glued; he made toy for the children; he fashion new netting-needl
and pin with improvements; and if everyth els wa done
sat down to hi larg fishing-net at one corner of the room

ann thought she left great happi behind her when they
quit the house; and louisa by whom she found herself walk
burst forth into raptur of admir and delight on the charact
of the navy; their friendli their brotherli their open
their uprightness; protest that she wa convinc of sailor have
more worth and warmth than ani other set of men in england;
that they onli knew how to live and they onli deserv to be
respect and love

they went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme
answer alreadi that noth wa found amiss; though it be
so entir out of season and the no thoroughfar of lyme
and the no expect of compani had brought mani apolog
from the head of the inn

ann found herself by thi time grow so much more harden
to be in captain wentworth compani than she had at first imagin
could ever be that the sit down to the same tabl with him now
and the interchang of the common civil attend on it
(they never got beyond) wa becom a mere noth

the night were too dark for the ladi to meet again till the morrow
but captain harvil had promis them a visit in the evening;
and he came bring hi friend also which wa more than
had been expect it have been agre that captain benwick
had all the appear of be oppress by the presenc of
so mani stranger he ventur among them again howev
though hi spirit certainli did not seem fit for the mirth
of the parti in gener

while captain wentworth and harvil led the talk on one side of the room
and by recur to former day suppli anecdot in abund
to occupi and entertain the other it fell to ann lot to be place
rather apart with captain benwick; and a veri good impuls
of her natur oblig her to begin an acquaint with him
he wa shi and dispos to abstraction; but the engag mild of
her counten and gentl of her manner soon had their effect;
and ann wa well repaid the first troubl of exert
he wa evid a young man of consider tast in read
though princip in poetry; and besid the persuas of have
given him at least an even indulg in the discuss of subject
which hi usual companion had probabl no concern in she had the hope
of be of real use to him in some suggest as to the duti and
benefit of struggl against afflict which had natur grown out
of their convers for though shi he did not seem reserved;
it had rather the appear of feel glad to burst their
usual restraints; and have talk of poetri the rich of
the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion
as to the first-rat poet tri to ascertain whether marmion
or the ladi of the lake were to be prefer and how rank the giaour
and the bride of abydos; and moreov how the giaour wa to be pronounc
he show himself so intim acquaint with all the tenderest song
of the one poet and all the impass descript of hopeless agoni
of the other; he repeat with such tremul feel the variou line
which imag a broken heart or a mind destroy by wretched
and look so entir as if he meant to be understood
that she ventur to hope he did not alway read onli poetri
and to say that she thought it wa the misfortun of poetri to be
seldom safe enjoy by those who enjoy it completely;
and that the strong feel which alon could estim it truli
were the veri feel which ought to tast it but sparingli

hi look shew him not pain but pleas with thi allus
to hi situat she wa embolden to go on; and feel in herself
the right of senior of mind she ventur to recommend
a larger allow of prose in hi daili study; and on be request
to particular mention such work of our best moralist
such collect of the finest letter such memoir of charact
of worth and suffer as occur to her at the moment
as calcul to rous and fortifi the mind by the highest precept
and the strongest exampl of moral and religi endur

captain benwick listen attent and seem grate for
the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head
and sigh which declar hi littl faith in the efficaci of ani book
on grief like hi note down the name of those she recommend
and promis to procur and read them

when the even wa over ann could not but be amus at the idea
of her come to lyme to preach patienc and resign to a young man
whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fear
on more seriou reflect that like mani other great moralist
and preacher she had been eloqu on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examin



chapter 12


ann and henrietta find themselv the earliest of the parti
the next morn agre to stroll down to the sea befor breakfast
they went to the sand to watch the flow of the tide
which a fine south-easterli breez wa bring in with all the grandeur
which so flat a shore admit they prais the morning;
glori in the sea; sympath in the delight of the fresh-feel
breeze--and were silent; till henrietta suddenli began again with--

oh! yes--i am quit convinc that with veri few except
the sea-air alway doe good there can be no doubt of it have been
of the greatest servic to dr shirley after hi ill
last spring twelve-month he declar himself that come to lyme
for a month did him more good than all the medicin he took;
and that be by the sea alway make him feel young again
now i cannot help think it a piti that he doe not live
entir by the sea i do think he had better leav uppercross entir
and fix at lyme do not you anne? do not you agre with me
that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mr shirley?
she ha cousin here you know and mani acquaint which would
make it cheer for her and i am sure she would be glad
to get to a place where she could have medic attend at hand
in case of hi have anoth seizur inde i think it quit melancholi
to have such excel peopl as dr and mr shirley who have been
do good all their live wear out their last day in a place
like uppercross where except our famili they seem shut out
from all the world i wish hi friend would propos it to him
i realli think they ought and as to procur a dispens
there could be no difficulti at hi time of life and with hi charact
my onli doubt is whether anyth could persuad him to leav hi parish
he is so veri strict and scrupul in hi notions; over-scrupul
i must say do not you think ann it is be over-scrupulous?
do not you think it is quit a mistaken point of conscienc
when a clergyman sacrific hi health for the sake of duti
which may be just as well perform by anoth person? and at lyme too
onli seventeen mile off he would be near enough to hear
if peopl thought there wa anyth to complain of

ann smile more than onc to herself dure thi speech
and enter into the subject as readi to do good by enter into
the feel of a young ladi as of a young man though here it wa good
of a lower standard for what could be offer but gener acquiescence?
she said all that wa reason and proper on the business;
felt the claim of dr shirley to repos as she ought; saw how veri
desir it wa that he should have some activ respect young man
as a resid curat and wa even courteou enough to hint at
the advantag of such resid curat be marri

i wish said henrietta veri well pleas with her companion
i wish ladi russel live at uppercross and were intim
with dr shirley i have alway heard of ladi russel as a woman of
the greatest influenc with everybody! i alway look upon her as abl
to persuad a person to anything! i am afraid of her as i have
told you befor quit afraid of her becaus she is so veri clever;
but i respect her amazingli and wish we had such a neighbour
at uppercross

ann wa amus by henrietta manner of be grate
and amus also that the cours of event and the new interest
of henrietta view should have place her friend at all in favour
with ani of the musgrov family; she had onli time howev
for a gener answer and a wish that such anoth woman
were at uppercross befor all subject suddenli ceas
on see louisa and captain wentworth come toward them
they came also for a stroll till breakfast wa like to be ready;
but louisa recollect immedi afterward that she had someth
to procur at a shop invit them all to go back with her into the town
they were all at her dispos

when they came to the step lead upward from the beach a gentleman
at the same moment prepar to come down polit drew back
and stop to give them way they ascend and pass him;
and as they pass ann face caught hi eye and he look at her
with a degre of earnest admir which she could not be insens of
she wa look remark well; her veri regular veri pretti featur
have the bloom and fresh of youth restor by the fine wind
which had been blow on her complexion and by the anim of eye
which it had also produc it wa evid that the gentleman
(complet a gentleman in manner) admir her exceedingli
captain wentworth look round at her instantli in a way which
shew hi notic of it he gave her a momentari glanc
a glanc of bright which seem to say that man is struck with you
and even i at thi moment see someth like ann elliot again

after attend louisa through her busi and loiter about
a littl longer they return to the inn; and ann in pass afterward
quickli from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearli run against
the veri same gentleman as he came out of an adjoin apart
she had befor conjectur him to be a stranger like themselv
and determin that a well-look groom who wa stroll about
near the two inn as they came back should be hi servant
both master and man be in mourn assist the idea
it wa now prove that he belong to the same inn as themselves;
and thi second meet short as it wa also prove again
by the gentleman look that he thought her veri love
and by the readi and proprieti of hi apolog that he wa
a man of exceedingli good manner he seem about thirti
and though not handsom had an agreeabl person ann felt that
she should like to know who he wa

they had nearli done breakfast when the sound of a carriag
(almost the first they had heard sinc enter lyme) drew half the parti
to the window it wa a gentleman carriag a curricl
but onli come round from the stable-yard to the front door;
somebodi must be go away it wa driven by a servant in mourn

the word curricl made charl musgrov jump up that he might
compar it with hi own; the servant in mourn rous ann curios
and the whole six were collect to look by the time the owner
of the curricl wa to be seen issu from the door amidst the bow
and civil of the household and take hi seat to drive off

ah! cri captain wentworth instantli and with half a glanc at ann
it is the veri man we pass

the miss musgrov agre to it; and have all kindli watch him
as far up the hill as they could they return to the breakfast tabl
the waiter came into the room soon afterward

pray said captain wentworth immedi can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away?

ye sir a mr elliot a gentleman of larg fortun came in last night
from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriag sir while you were
at dinner; and go on now for crewkhern in hi way to bath
and london

elliot! mani had look on each other and mani had repeat the name
befor all thi had been got through even by the smart rapid
of a waiter

bless me! cri mary; it must be our cousin; it must be our mr elliot
it must indeed! charl ann must not it? in mourn you see
just as our mr elliot must be how veri extraordinary!
in the veri same inn with us! ann must not it be our mr elliot?
my father next heir? pray sir turn to the waiter
did not you hear did not hi servant say whether he belong
to the kellynch family?

no maam he did not mention no particular family; but he said
hi master wa a veri rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day

there! you see! cri mari in an ecstasi just as i said!
heir to sir walter elliot! i wa sure that would come out
if it wa so depend upon it that is a circumst which hi servant
take care to publish wherev he goe but ann onli conceiv
how extraordinary! i wish i had look at him more i wish we had
been awar in time who it wa that he might have been introduc to us
what a piti that we should not have been introduc to each other!
do you think he had the elliot countenance? i hardli look at him
i wa look at the horses; but i think he had someth
of the elliot counten i wonder the arm did not strike me!
oh! the great-coat wa hang over the panel and hid the arm
so it did; otherwis i am sure i should have observ them
and the liveri too; if the servant had not been in mourn
one should have known him by the liveri

put all these veri extraordinari circumst togeth
said captain wentworth we must consid it to be the arrang
of provid that you should not be introduc to your cousin

when she could command mari attent ann quietli tri
to convinc her that their father and mr elliot had not for mani year
been on such term as to make the power of attempt an introduct
at all desir

at the same time howev it wa a secret gratif to herself
to have seen her cousin and to know that the futur owner of kellynch
wa undoubtedli a gentleman and had an air of good sens
she would not upon ani account mention her have met with him
the second time; luckili mari did not much attend to their have
pass close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt
quit ill-us by ann have actual run against him in the passag
and receiv hi veri polit excus while she had never been
near him at all; no that cousinli littl interview must remain
a perfect secret

of cours said mari you will mention our see mr elliot
the next time you write to bath i think my father certainli
ought to hear of it; do mention all about him

ann avoid a direct repli but it wa just the circumst
which she consid as not mere unnecessari to be commun
but as what ought to be suppress the offenc which had been given
her father mani year back she knew; elizabeth particular share in it
she suspected; and that mr elliot idea alway produc irrit in both
wa beyond a doubt mari never wrote to bath herself; all the toil
of keep up a slow and unsatisfactori correspond with elizabeth
fell on ann

breakfast had not been long over when they were join by captain
and mr harvil and captain benwick; with whom they had appoint
to take their last walk about lyme they ought to be set off
for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all togeth
and out of door as long as they could

ann found captain benwick get near her as soon as they were all
fairli in the street their convers the preced even
did not disinclin him to seek her again; and they walk togeth
some time talk as befor of mr scott and lord byron
and still as unabl as befor and as unabl as ani other two reader
to think exactli alik of the merit of either till someth
occas an almost gener chang amongst their parti and instead of
captain benwick she had captain harvil by her side

miss elliot said he speak rather low you have done a good deed
in make that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have
such compani often it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is;
but what can we do? we cannot part

no said ann that i can easili believ to be impossible;
but in time perhaps--w know what time doe in everi case of afflict
and you must rememb captain harvil that your friend
may yet be call a young mourner--onli last summer i understand

ay true enough (with a deep sigh) onli june

and not known to him perhap so soon

not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape
just made into the grappler i wa at plymouth dread to hear of him;
he sent in letter but the grappler wa under order for portsmouth
there the news must follow him but who wa to tell it? not i
i would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm nobodi could do it
but that good fellow (point to captain wentworth) the laconia
had come into plymouth the week before; no danger of her
be sent to sea again he stood hi chanc for the rest;
wrote up for leav of absenc but without wait the return
travel night and day till he got to portsmouth row off
to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week
that what he did and nobodi els could have save poor jame
you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us!

ann did think on the question with perfect decis and said as much
in repli as her own feel could accomplish or as hi seem
abl to bear for he wa too much affect to renew the subject
and when he spoke again it wa of someth total differ

mr harvil give it as her opinion that her husband would have
quit walk enough by the time he reach home determin the direct
of all the parti in what wa to be their last walk; they would
accompani them to their door and then return and set off themselv
by all their calcul there wa just time for this; but as they drew
near the cobb there wa such a gener wish to walk along it onc more
all were so inclin and louisa soon grew so determin
that the differ of a quarter of an hour it wa found
would be no differ at all; so with all the kind leave-tak
and all the kind interchang of invit and promis which
may be imagin they part from captain and mr harvil
at their own door and still accompani by captain benwick
who seem to cling to them to the last proceed to make
the proper adieu to the cobb

ann found captain benwick again draw near her lord byron
dark blue sea could not fail of be brought forward by
their present view and she gladli gave him all her attent as long as
attent wa possibl it wa soon drawn perforc anoth way

there wa too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant
for the ladi and they agre to get down the step to the lower
and all were content to pass quietli and care down the steep flight
except louisa; she must be jump down them by captain wentworth
in all their walk he had had to jump her from the stiles;
the sensat wa delight to her the hard of the pavement
for her feet made him less will upon the present occasion;
he did it howev she wa safe down and instantli
to show her enjoy ran up the step to be jump down again
he advis her against it thought the jar too great; but no
he reason and talk in vain she smile and said i am determin
i will: he put out hi hands; she wa too precipit by half a second
she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and wa taken up lifeless!
there wa no wound no blood no visibl bruise; but her eye were close
she breath not her face wa like death the horror of the moment
to all who stood around!

captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in hi arm
look on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agoni of silenc
she is dead! she is dead! scream mari catch hold of her
husband and contribut with hi own horror to make him immoveable;
and in anoth moment henrietta sink under the convict lost
her sens too and would have fallen on the step but for captain
benwick and ann who caught and support her between them

is there no one to help me? were the first word which
burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if
all hi own strength were gone

go to him go to him cri ann for heaven sake go to him
i can support her myself leav me and go to him rub her hand
rub her temples; here are salts; take them take them

captain benwick obey and charl at the same moment
disengag himself from hi wife they were both with him;
and louisa wa rais up and support more firmli between them
and everyth wa done that ann had prompt but in vain;
while captain wentworth stagger against the wall for hi support
exclaim in the bitterest agony--

oh god! her father and mother!

a surgeon! said ann

he caught the word; it seem to rous him at onc and say only--
true true a surgeon thi instant wa dart away
when ann eagerli suggested--

captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick?
he know where a surgeon is to be found

everi one capabl of think felt the advantag of the idea
and in a moment (it wa all done in rapid moments) captain benwick had
resign the poor corpse-lik figur entir to the brother care
and wa off for the town with the utmost rapid

as to the wretch parti left behind it could scarc be said
which of the three who were complet ration wa suffer most:
captain wentworth ann or charl who realli a veri affection
brother hung over louisa with sob of grief and could onli turn hi eye
from one sister to see the other in a state as insens
or to wit the hyster agit of hi wife call on him
for help which he could not give

ann attend with all the strength and zeal and thought
which instinct suppli to henrietta still tri at interv
to suggest comfort to the other tri to quiet mari to anim charl
to assuag the feel of captain wentworth both seem to look to her
for direct

ann ann cri charl what is to be done next?
what in heaven name is to be done next?

captain wentworth eye were also turn toward her

had not she better be carri to the inn? ye i am sure:
carri her gentli to the inn

ye ye to the inn repeat captain wentworth compar
collect and eager to be do someth i will carri her myself
musgrov take care of the other

by thi time the report of the accid had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the cobb and mani were collect near them
to be use if want at ani rate to enjoy the sight of
a dead young ladi nay two dead young ladi for it prove twice as fine
as the first report to some of the best-look of these good peopl
henrietta wa consign for though partial reviv
she wa quit helpless; and in thi manner ann walk by her side
and charl attend to hi wife they set forward tread back
with feel unutter the ground which so late so veri late
and so light of heart they had pass along

they were not off the cobb befor the harvil met them
captain benwick had been seen fli by their hous with a counten
which show someth to be wrong; and they had set off immedi
inform and direct as they pass toward the spot
shock as captain harvil wa he brought sens and nerv
that could be instantli useful; and a look between him and hi wife
decid what wa to be done she must be taken to their house;
all must go to their house; and await the surgeon arriv there
they would not listen to scruples: he wa obeyed; they were all
beneath hi roof; and while louisa under mr harvil direct
wa convey up stair and given possess of her own bed
assist cordial restor were suppli by her husband
to all who need them

louisa had onc open her eye but soon close them again
without appar conscious thi had been a proof of life
howev of servic to her sister; and henrietta though perfectli
incap of be in the same room with louisa wa kept
by the agit of hope and fear from a return of her own insens
mari too wa grow calmer

the surgeon wa with them almost befor it had seem possibl
they were sick with horror while he examined; but he wa not hopeless
the head had receiv a sever contus but he had seen greater injuri
recov from: he wa by no mean hopeless; he spoke cheer

that he did not regard it as a desper case that he did not say
a few hour must end it wa at first felt beyond the hope of most;
and the ecstasi of such a repriev the rejoic deep and silent
after a few fervent ejacul of gratitud to heaven had been offer
may be conceiv

the tone the look with which thank god! wa utter
by captain wentworth ann wa sure could never be forgotten by her;
nor the sight of him afterward as he sat near a tabl lean over it
with fold arm and face conceal as if overpow by
the variou feel of hi soul and tri by prayer and reflect
to calm them

louisa limb had escap there wa no injuri but to the head

it now becam necessari for the parti to consid what wa best to be done
as to their gener situat they were now abl to speak to each other
and consult that louisa must remain where she wa howev distress
to her friend to be involv the harvil in such troubl
did not admit a doubt her remov wa imposs the harvil
silenc all scruples; and as much as they could all gratitud
they had look forward and arrang everyth befor the other
began to reflect captain benwick must give up hi room to them
and get anoth bed elsewhere; and the whole wa settl
they were onli concern that the hous could accommod no more;
and yet perhap by put the children away in the maid room
or swing a cot somewher they could hardli bear to think of not
find room for two or three besid suppos they might wish to stay;
though with regard to ani attend on miss musgrov there need not be
the least uneasi in leav her to mr harvil care entir
mr harvil wa a veri experienc nurs and her nursery-maid
who had live with her long and gone about with her everywher
wa just such anoth between these two she could want
no possibl attend by day or night and all thi wa said
with a truth and sincer of feel irresist

charl henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consult
and for a littl while it wa onli an interchang of perplex and terror
uppercross the necess of some one go to uppercross;
the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to mr and mr musgrove;
the late of the morning; an hour alreadi gone sinc they
ought to have been off; the imposs of be in toler time
at first they were capabl of noth more to the purpos
than such exclamations; but after a while captain wentworth
exert himself said--

we must be decid and without the loss of anoth minut
everi minut is valuabl some one must resolv on be off
for uppercross instantli musgrov either you or i must go

charl agre but declar hi resolut of not go away
he would be as littl incumbr as possibl to captain and mr harville;
but as to leav hi sister in such a state he neither ought nor would
so far it wa decided; and henrietta at first declar the same
she howev wa soon persuad to think differ the use
of her staying! she who had not been abl to remain in louisa room
or to look at her without suffer which made her wors than helpless!
she wa forc to acknowledg that she could do no good
yet wa still unwil to be away till touch by the thought
of her father and mother she gave it up; she consent
she wa anxiou to be at home

the plan had reach thi point when ann come quietli
down from louisa room could not but hear what follow
for the parlour door wa open

then it is settl musgrov cri captain wentworth
that you stay and that i take care of your sister home
but as to the rest as to the other if one stay to assist mr harvil
i think it need be onli one mr charl musgrov will of cours
wish to get back to her children; but if ann will stay no one so proper
so capabl as ann

she paus a moment to recov from the emot of hear herself
so spoken of the other two warmli agre with what he said
and she then appear

you will stay i am sure; you will stay and nurs her; cri he
turn to her and speak with a glow and yet a gentl
which seem almost restor the past she colour deepli
and he recollect himself and move away she express herself
most will readi happi to remain it wa what she had been
think of and wish to be allow to do a bed on the floor
in louisa room would be suffici for her if mr harvil
would but think so

one thing more and all seem arrang though it wa rather desir
that mr and mr musgrov should be previous alarm by some
share of delay; yet the time requir by the uppercross hors
to take them back would be a dread extens of suspense;
and captain wentworth propos and charl musgrov agre
that it would be much better for him to take a chais from the inn
and leav mr musgrov carriag and hors to be sent home
the next morn earli when there would be the farther advantag
of send an account of louisa night

captain wentworth now hurri off to get everyth readi on hi part
and to be soon follow by the two ladi when the plan wa
made known to mari howev there wa an end of all peac in it
she wa so wretch and so vehement complain so much of injustic
in be expect to go away instead of anne; ann who wa
noth to louisa while she wa her sister and had the best right
to stay in henrietta stead! whi wa not she to be as use as anne?
and to go home without charl too without her husband!
no it wa too unkind and in short she said more than her husband
could long withstand and as none of the other could oppos
when he gave way there wa no help for it; the chang of mari for ann
wa inevit

ann had never submit more reluctantli to the jealou
and ill-judg claim of mary; but so it must be and they set off
for the town charl take care of hi sister and captain benwick
attend to her she gave a moment recollect as they hurri along
to the littl circumst which the same spot had wit
earlier in the morn there she had listen to henrietta scheme
for dr shirley leav uppercross; farther on she had
first seen mr elliot; a moment seem all that could now be given
to ani one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfar

captain benwick wa most consider attent to her; and
unit as they all seem by the distress of the day she felt
an increas degre of good-wil toward him and a pleasur even
in think that it might perhap be the occas of continu
their acquaint

captain wentworth wa on the watch for them and a chais and four in wait
station for their conveni in the lowest part of the street;
but hi evid surpris and vexat at the substitut of one sister
for the other the chang in hi counten the astonish
the express begun and suppress with which charl wa listen to
made but a mortifi recept of anne; or must at least convinc her
that she wa valu onli as she could be use to louisa

she endeavour to be compos and to be just without emul
the feel of an emma toward her henri she would have
attend on louisa with a zeal abov the common claim of regard
for hi sake; and she hope he would not long be so unjust
as to suppos she would shrink unnecessarili from the offic of a friend

in the mean while she wa in the carriag he had hand them both in
and place himself between them; and in thi manner under these
circumst full of astonish and emot to ann she quit lyme
how the long stage would pass; how it wa to affect their manners;
what wa to be their sort of intercours she could not forese
it wa all quit natur howev he wa devot to henrietta;
alway turn toward her; and when he spoke at all alway with the view
of support her hope and rais her spirit in gener
hi voic and manner were studious calm to spare henrietta
from agit seem the govern principl onc onli
when she had been griev over the last ill-judg ill-fat
walk to the cobb bitterli lament that it ever had been thought of
he burst forth as if wholli overcome--

dont talk of it dont talk of it he cri oh god! that i had
not given way to her at the fatal moment! had i done as i ought!
but so eager and so resolute! dear sweet louisa!

ann wonder whether it ever occur to him now to question the just
of hi own previou opinion as to the univers felic and advantag
of firm of character; and whether it might not strike him that
like all other qualiti of the mind it should have it proport
and limit she thought it could scarc escap him to feel
that a persuad temper might sometim be as much in favour of happi
as a veri resolut charact

they got on fast ann wa astonish to recognis the same hill
and the same object so soon their actual speed heighten by
some dread of the conclus made the road appear but half as long
as on the day befor it wa grow quit dusk howev
befor they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been
total silenc among them for some time henrietta lean back
in the corner with a shawl over her face give the hope of her
have cri herself to sleep; when as they were go up their last hill
ann found herself all at onc address by captain wentworth
in a low cautiou voic he said: --

i have been consid what we had best do she must not
appear at first she could not stand it i have been think whether
you had not better remain in the carriag with her while i go in
and break it to mr and mr musgrov do you think thi is a good plan?

she did: he wa satisfi and said no more but the remembr
of the appeal remain a pleasur to her as a proof of friendship
and of defer for her judgement a great pleasure; and when it becam
a sort of part proof it valu did not lessen

when the distress commun at uppercross wa over
and he had seen the father and mother quit as compos as could be hope
and the daughter all the better for be with them he announc
hi intent of return in the same carriag to lyme;
and when the hors were bait he wa off

(end of volum one)



chapter 13


the remaind of ann time at uppercross comprehend onli two day
wa spent entir at the mansion house; and she had the satisfact
of know herself extrem use there both as an immedi companion
and as assist in all those arrang for the futur which
in mr and mr musgrov distress state of spirit would have
been difficulti

they had an earli account from lyme the next morn louisa wa
much the same no symptom wors than befor had appear
charl came a few hour afterward to bring a later and
more particular account he wa toler cheer a speedi cure
must not be hope but everyth wa go on as well
as the natur of the case admit in speak of the harvil
he seem unabl to satisfi hi own sens of their kind
especi of mr harvil exert as a nurs she realli left
noth for mari to do he and mari had been persuad to go earli
to their inn last night mari had been hyster again thi morn
when he came away she wa go to walk out with captain benwick
which he hope would do her good he almost wish she had been
prevail on to come home the day before; but the truth wa
that mr harvil left noth for anybodi to do

charl wa to return to lyme the same afternoon and hi father
had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladi could not consent
it would be go onli to multipli troubl to the other
and increas hi own distress; and a much better scheme follow
and wa act upon a chais wa sent for from crewkhern
and charl convey back a far more use person in the old nursery-maid
of the famili one who have brought up all the children
and seen the veri last the linger and long-pet master harri
sent to school after hi brother wa now live in her desert nurseri
to mend stock and dress all the blain and bruis she could
get near her and who consequ wa onli too happi in be
allow to go and help nurs dear miss louisa vagu wish of
get sarah thither had occur befor to mr musgrov and henrietta;
but without ann it would hardli have been resolv on
and found practic so soon

they were indebt the next day to charl hayter for all
the minut knowledg of louisa which it wa so essenti to obtain
everi twenty-four hour he made it hi busi to go to lyme
and hi account wa still encourag the interv of sens
and conscious were believ to be stronger everi report agre
in captain wentworth appear fix in lyme

ann wa to leav them on the morrow an event which they all dread
what should they do without her? they were wretch comfort
for one anoth and so much wa said in thi way that ann thought
she could not do better than impart among them the gener inclin
to which she wa privi and persuad them all to go to lyme at onc
she had littl difficulty; it wa soon determin that they would go;
go to-morrow fix themselv at the inn or get into lodg
as it suit and there remain till dear louisa could be move
they must be take off some troubl from the good peopl she wa with;
they might at least reliev mr harvil from the care of her own children;
and in short they were so happi in the decis that ann wa delight
with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her
last morn at uppercross better than in assist their prepar
and send them off at an earli hour though her be left
to the solitari rang of the hous wa the consequ

she wa the last except the littl boy at the cottag
she wa the veri last the onli remain one of all that had fill
and anim both hous of all that had given uppercross
it cheer charact a few day had made a chang indeed!

if louisa recov it would all be well again more than
former happi would be restor there could not be a doubt
to her mind there wa none of what would follow her recoveri
a few month henc and the room now so desert occupi but by
her silent pensiv self might be fill again with all that wa happi
and gay all that wa glow and bright in prosper love
all that wa most unlik ann elliot!

an hour complet leisur for such reflect as these
on a dark novemb day a small thick rain almost blot out
the veri few object ever to be discern from the window wa enough
to make the sound of ladi russel carriag exceedingli welcome;
and yet though desir to be gone she could not quit the mansion hous
or look an adieu to the cottag with it black drip and
comfortless veranda or even notic through the misti glass
the last humbl tenement of the villag without a sadden heart
scene had pass in uppercross which made it preciou
it stood the record of mani sensat of pain onc sever
but now softened; and of some instanc of relent feel
some breath of friendship and reconcili which could
never be look for again and which could never ceas to be dear
she left it all behind her all but the recollect that
such thing had been

ann had never enter kellynch sinc her quit ladi russel hous
in septemb it had not been necessari and the few occas of
it be possibl for her to go to the hall she had contriv to evad
and escap from her first return wa to resum her place in the modern
and eleg apart of the lodg and to gladden the eye
of it mistress

there wa some anxieti mix with ladi russel joy in meet her
she knew who had been frequent uppercross but happili
either ann wa improv in plump and look or ladi russel
fanci her so; and ann in receiv her compliment on the occas
had the amus of connect them with the silent admir
of her cousin and of hope that she wa to be bless with
a second spring of youth and beauti

when they came to convers she wa soon sensibl of some mental chang
the subject of which her heart had been full on leav kellynch
and which she had felt slight and been compel to smother
among the musgrov were now becom but of secondari interest
she had late lost sight even of her father and sister and bath
their concern had been sunk under those of uppercross;
and when ladi russel revert to their former hope and fear
and spoke her satisfact in the hous in camden place
which had been taken and her regret that mr clay should still
be with them ann would have been asham to have it known
how much more she wa think of lyme and louisa musgrov
and all her acquaint there; how much more interest to her
wa the home and the friendship of the harvil and captain benwick
than her own father hous in camden place or her own sister intimaci
with mr clay she wa actual forc to exert herself
to meet ladi russel with anyth like the appear of equal solicitud
on topic which had by natur the first claim on her

there wa a littl awkward at first in their discours
on anoth subject they must speak of the accid at lyme
ladi russel had not been arriv five minut the day befor
when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must
be talk of she must make enquiri she must regret the imprud
lament the result and captain wentworth name must be mention by both
ann wa consciou of not do it so well as ladi russel
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to
ladi russel eye till she had adopt the expedi of tell her
briefli what she thought of the attach between him and louisa
when thi wa told hi name distress her no longer

ladi russel had onli to listen composedli and wish them happi
but intern her heart revel in angri pleasur in pleas contempt
that the man who at twenty-thre had seem to understand somewhat
of the valu of an ann elliot should eight year afterward
be charm by a louisa musgrov

the first three or four day pass most quietli with no circumst
to mark them except the receipt of a note or two from lyme
which found their way to ann she could not tell how and brought
a rather improv account of louisa at the end of that period
ladi russel polit could repos no longer and the fainter
self-threaten of the past becam in a decid tone
i must call on mr croft; i realli must call upon her soon
ann have you courag to go with me and pay a visit in that house?
it will be some trial to us both

ann did not shrink from it; on the contrari she truli felt as she said
in observing--

i think you are veri like to suffer the most of the two;
your feel are less reconcil to the chang than mine
by remain in the neighbourhood i am becom inur to it

she could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact
so high an opinion of the croft and consid her father
so veri fortun in hi tenant felt the parish to be so sure
of a good exampl and the poor of the best attent and relief
that howev sorri and asham for the necess of the remov
she could not but in conscienc feel that they were gone
who deserv not to stay and that kellynch hall had pass
into better hand than it owner these convict must unquestion
have their own pain and sever wa it kind; but they preclud
that pain which ladi russel would suffer in enter the hous again
and return through the well-known apart

in such moment ann had no power of say to herself
these room ought to belong onli to us oh how fallen
in their destination! how unworthili occupied! an ancient famili
to be so driven away! stranger fill their place!
no except when she thought of her mother and rememb where
she had been use to sit and presid she had no sigh of that descript
to heav

mr croft alway met her with a kind which gave her the pleasur
of fanci herself a favourit and on the present occas
receiv her in that hous there wa particular attent

the sad accid at lyme wa soon the prevail topic
and on compar their latest account of the invalid it appear
that each ladi date her intellig from the same hour of yestermorn;
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday (the first time
sinc the accident) had brought ann the last note which she had
not been abl to trace the exact step of; had staid a few hour
and then return again to lyme and without ani present intent
of quit it ani more he had enquir after her she found
particularly; had express hi hope of miss elliot not be
the wors for her exert and had spoken of those exert as great
thi wa handsom and gave her more pleasur than almost anyth els
could have done

as to the sad catastroph itself it could be canvass onli in one style
by a coupl of steadi sensibl women whose judgement had to work
on ascertain events; and it wa perfectli decid that it had been
the consequ of much thoughtless and much imprudence;
that it effect were most alarm and that it wa fright to think
how long miss musgrov recoveri might yet be doubt and how liabl
she would still remain to suffer from the concuss hereafter!
the admir wound it up summarili by exclaiming--

ay a veri bad busi inde a new sort of way thi
for a young fellow to be make love by break hi mistresss head
is not it miss elliot? thi is break a head and give a plaster
truly!

admir croft manner were not quit of the tone to suit ladi russel
but they delight ann hi good of heart and simplic
of charact were irresist

now thi must be veri bad for you said he suddenli rous from
a littl reveri to be come and find us here i had not
recollect it befor i declar but it must be veri bad
but now do not stand upon ceremoni get up and go over all the room
in the hous if you like it

anoth time sir i thank you not now

well whenev it suit you you can slip in from the shrubberi
at ani time; and there you will find we keep our umbrella hang up
by that door a good place is not it? but (check himself)
you will not think it a good place for your were alway kept
in the butler room ay so it alway is i believ
one man way may be as good as anoth but we all like our own best
and so you must judg for yourself whether it would be better for you
to go about the hous or not

ann find she might declin it did so veri grate

we have made veri few chang either continu the admir
after think a moment veri few we told you about the laundry-door
at uppercross that ha been a veri great improv
the wonder wa how ani famili upon earth could bear with the inconveni
of it open as it did so long! you will tell sir walter
what we have done and that mr shepherd think it the greatest improv
the hous ever had inde i must do ourselv the justic to say
that the few alter we have made have been all veri much
for the better my wife should have the credit of them howev
i have done veri littl besid send away some of the larg
looking-glass from my dressing-room which wa your father
a veri good man and veri much the gentleman i am sure:
but i should think miss elliot (look with seriou reflection)
i should think he must be rather a dressi man for hi time of life
such a number of looking-glasses! oh lord! there wa no get away
from one self so i got sophi to lend me a hand and we soon
shift their quarters; and now i am quit snug with my
littl shave glass in one corner and anoth great thing
that i never go near

ann amus in spite of herself wa rather distress for an answer
and the admir fear he might not have been civil enough
took up the subject again to say--

the next time you write to your good father miss elliot
pray give him my compliment and mr croft and say that we are
settl here quit to our like and have no fault at all to find
with the place the breakfast-room chimney smoke a littl
i grant you but it is onli when the wind is due north and blow hard
which may not happen three time a winter and take it altogeth
now that we have been into most of the hous hereabout and can judg
there is not one that we like better than thi pray say so
with my compliment he will be glad to hear it

ladi russel and mr croft were veri well pleas with each other:
but the acquaint which thi visit began wa fate not to proceed
far at present; for when it wa return the croft announc
themselv to be go away for a few week to visit their connexion
in the north of the counti and probabl might not be at home again
befor ladi russel would be remov to bath

so end all danger to ann of meet captain wentworth at kellynch hall
or of see him in compani with her friend everyth wa safe enough
and she smile over the mani anxiou feel she had wast
on the subject



chapter 14


though charl and mari had remain at lyme much longer after
mr and mr musgrov go than ann conceiv they could have been
at all want they were yet the first of the famili to be at home again;
and as soon as possibl after their return to uppercross
they drove over to the lodg they had left louisa begin to sit up;
but her head though clear wa exceedingli weak and her nerv
suscept to the highest extrem of tenderness; and though
she might be pronounc to be altogeth do veri well
it wa still imposs to say when she might be abl to bear
the remov home; and her father and mother who must return
in time to receiv their younger children for the christma holiday
had hardli a hope of be allow to bring her with them

they had been all in lodg togeth mr musgrov had
got mr harvil children away as much as she could everi possibl
suppli from uppercross had been furnish to lighten the inconveni
to the harvil while the harvil had been want them
to come to dinner everi day; and in short it seem to have been
onli a struggl on each side as to which should be most disinterest
and hospit

mari had had her evils; but upon the whole as wa evid
by her stay so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer
charl hayter had been at lyme often than suit her; and when
they dine with the harvil there had been onli a maid-serv to wait
and at first mr harvil had alway given mr musgrov precedence;
but then she had receiv so veri handsom an apolog from her
on find out whose daughter she wa and there had been so much
go on everi day there had been so mani walk between their lodg
and the harvil and she had got book from the librari
and chang them so often that the balanc had certainli been
much in favour of lyme she had been taken to charmouth too
and she had bath and she had gone to church and there were a great mani
more peopl to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross;
and all thi join to the sens of be so veri use
had made realli an agreeabl fortnight

ann enquir after captain benwick mari face wa cloud directli
charl laugh

oh! captain benwick is veri well i believ but he is
a veri odd young man i do not know what he would be at
we ask him to come home with us for a day or two: charl undertook
to give him some shoot and he seem quit delight and for my part
i thought it wa all settled; when behold! on tuesday night
he made a veri awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot and he had
`been quit misunderstood and he had promis thi and he had
promis that and the end of it wa i found that he did not mean to come
i suppos he wa afraid of find it dull; but upon my word
i should have thought we were live enough at the cottag
for such a heart-broken man as captain benwick

charl laugh again and said now mari you know veri well
how it realli wa it wa all your do (turn to anne)
he fanci that if he went with us he should find you close by:
he fanci everybodi to be live in uppercross; and when he discov
that ladi russel live three mile off hi heart fail him
and he had not courag to come that is the fact upon my honour
mari know it is

but mari did not give into it veri gracious whether from
not consid captain benwick entitl by birth and situat
to be in love with an elliot or from not want to believ
ann a greater attract to uppercross than herself must be
left to be guess ann good-wil howev wa not to be lessen
by what she heard she boldli acknowledg herself flatter
and continu her enquiri

oh! he talk of you cri charl in such terms--
mari interrupt him i declar charl i never heard him
mention ann twice all the time i wa there i declar ann
he never talk of you at all

no admit charl i do not know that he ever doe in a gener
way; but howev it is a veri clear thing that he admir you exceedingli
hi head is full of some book that he is read upon your recommend
and he want to talk to you about them; he ha found out someth or other
in one of them which he thinks--oh! i cannot pretend to rememb it
but it wa someth veri fine--i overheard him tell henrietta
all about it; and then `miss elliot wa spoken of in the highest terms!
now mari i declar it wa so i heard it myself and you were
in the other room `eleg sweet beauti oh! there wa no end
of miss elliot charm

and i am sure cri mari warmli it wa a veri littl to hi credit
if he did miss harvil onli die last june such a heart
is veri littl worth having; is it ladi russell? i am sure
you will agre with me

i must see captain benwick befor i decid said ladi russel smile

and that you are veri like to do veri soon i can tell you maam
said charl though he had not nerv for come away with us
and set off again afterward to pay a formal visit here
he will make hi way over to kellynch one day by himself
you may depend on it i told him the distanc and the road
and i told him of the church be so veri well worth seeing;
for as he ha a tast for those sort of thing i thought that would
be a good excus and he listen with all hi understand and soul;
and i am sure from hi manner that you will have him call here soon
so i give you notic ladi russel

ani acquaint of ann will alway be welcom to me
wa ladi russel kind answer

oh! as to be ann acquaint said mari i think he is rather
my acquaint for i have been see him everi day thi last fortnight

well as your joint acquaint then i shall be veri happi
to see captain benwick

you will not find anyth veri agreeabl in him i assur you maam
he is one of the dullest young men that ever live he ha walk with me
sometim from one end of the sand to the other without say a word
he is not at all a well-br young man i am sure you will not like him

there we differ mari said ann i think ladi russel would like him
i think she would be so much pleas with hi mind that she would
veri soon see no defici in hi manner

so do i ann said charl i am sure ladi russel would like him
he is just ladi russel sort give him a book and he will
read all day long

ye that he will! exclaim mari tauntingli he will sit pore
over hi book and not know when a person speak to him or when one
drop one scissor or anyth that happen do you think
ladi russel would like that?

ladi russel could not help laugh upon my word said she
i should not have suppos that my opinion of ani one could have
admit of such differ of conjectur steadi and matter of fact
as i may call myself i have realli a curios to see the person
who can give occas to such directli opposit notion
i wish he may be induc to call here and when he doe mari
you may depend upon hear my opinion; but i am determin
not to judg him beforehand

you will not like him i will answer for it

ladi russel began talk of someth els mari spoke with anim
of their meet with or rather miss mr elliot so extraordinarili

he is a man said ladi russel whom i have no wish to see
hi declin to be on cordial term with the head of hi famili
ha left a veri strong impress in hi disfavour with me

thi decis check mari eager and stop her short
in the midst of the elliot counten

with regard to captain wentworth though ann hazard no enquiri
there wa voluntari commun suffici hi spirit had been
greatli recov late as might be expect as louisa improv
he had improv and he wa now quit a differ creatur
from what he had been the first week he had not seen louisa;
and wa so extrem fear of ani ill consequ to her
from an interview that he did not press for it at all; and
on the contrari seem to have a plan of go away for a week
or ten day till her head wa stronger he had talk of go
down to plymouth for a week and want to persuad captain benwick
to go with him; but as charl maintain to the last captain benwick
seem much more dispos to ride over to kellynch

there can be no doubt that ladi russel and ann were both
occasion think of captain benwick from thi time
ladi russel could not hear the door-bel without feel that it might
be hi herald; nor could ann return from ani stroll of solitari indulg
in her father ground or ani visit of chariti in the villag
without wonder whether she might see him or hear of him
captain benwick came not howev he wa either less dispos for it
than charl had imagin or he wa too shy; and after give him
a week indulg ladi russel determin him to be unworthi
of the interest which he had been begin to excit

the musgrov came back to receiv their happi boy and girl from school
bring with them mr harvil littl children to improv the nois
of uppercross and lessen that of lyme henrietta remain with louisa;
but all the rest of the famili were again in their usual quarter

ladi russel and ann paid their compliment to them onc
when ann could not but feel that uppercross wa alreadi quit aliv again
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charl hayter
nor captain wentworth were there the room present as strong a contrast
as could be wish to the last state she had seen it in

immedi surround mr musgrov were the littl harvil
whom she wa sedul guard from the tyranni of the two children
from the cottag expressli arriv to amus them on one side
wa a tabl occupi by some chatter girl cut up silk
and gold paper; and on the other were tressel and tray
bend under the weight of brawn and cold pie where riotou boy
were hold high revel; the whole complet by a roar christma fire
which seem determin to be heard in spite of all the nois
of the other charl and mari also came in of cours
dure their visit and mr musgrov made a point of pay hi respect
to ladi russel and sat down close to her for ten minut
talk with a veri rais voic but from the clamour of the children
on hi knee gener in vain it wa a fine family-piec

ann judg from her own tempera would have deem
such a domest hurrican a bad restor of the nerv
which louisa ill must have so greatli shaken but mr musgrov
who got ann near her on purpos to thank her most cordial
again and again for all her attent to them conclud
a short recapitul of what she had suffer herself by observ
with a happi glanc round the room that after all she had gone through
noth wa so like to do her good as a littl quiet cheer
at home

louisa wa now recov apac her mother could even think of her
be abl to join their parti at home befor her brother and sister
went to school again the harvil had promis to come with her
and stay at uppercross whenev she return captain wentworth wa gone
for the present to see hi brother in shropshir

i hope i shall rememb in futur said ladi russel as soon as
they were reseat in the carriag not to call at uppercross
in the christma holiday

everybodi ha their tast in nois as well as in other matters;
and sound are quit innoxi or most distress by their sort
rather than their quantiti when ladi russel not long afterward
wa enter bath on a wet afternoon and drive through
the long cours of street from the old bridg to camden place
amidst the dash of other carriag the heavi rumbl of cart and dray
the bawl of newspapermen muffin-men and milkmen and the ceaseless
clink of patten she made no complaint no these were nois
which belong to the winter pleasures; her spirit rose
under their influence; and like mr musgrov she wa feel
though not say that after be long in the countri noth could be
so good for her as a littl quiet cheer

ann did not share these feel she persist in a veri determin
though veri silent disinclin for bath; caught the first dim view
of the extens build smoke in rain without ani wish
of see them better; felt their progress through the street to be
howev disagre yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her
when she arrived? and look back with fond regret to the bustl
of uppercross and the seclus of kellynch

elizabeth last letter had commun a piec of news of some interest
mr elliot wa in bath he had call in camden place; had call
a second time a third; had been pointedli attent if elizabeth
and her father did not deceiv themselv had been take much pain
to seek the acquaint and proclaim the valu of the connect
as he had formerli taken pain to shew neglect thi wa veri wonder
if it were true; and ladi russel wa in a state of veri agreeabl
curios and perplex about mr elliot alreadi recant the sentiment
she had so late express to mari of hi be a man whom she had
no wish to see she had a great wish to see him if he realli sought
to reconcil himself like a duti branch he must be forgiven
for have dismemb himself from the patern tree

ann wa not anim to an equal pitch by the circumst
but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not
which wa more than she could say for mani other person in bath

she wa put down in camden place; and ladi russel then drove
to her own lodg in river street



chapter 15


sir walter had taken a veri good hous in camden place
a lofti dignifi situat such as becom a man of consequence;
and both he and elizabeth were settl there much to their satisfact

ann enter it with a sink heart anticip an imprison
of mani month and anxious say to herself oh! when shall i
leav you again? a degre of unexpect cordial howev
in the welcom she receiv did her good her father and sister
were glad to see her for the sake of shew her the hous and furnitur
and met her with kind her make a fourth when they
sat down to dinner wa notic as an advantag

mr clay wa veri pleasant and veri smile but her courtesi and smile
were more a matter of cours ann had alway felt that she would
pretend what wa proper on her arriv but the complais of the other
wa unlook for they were evid in excel spirit
and she wa soon to listen to the caus they had no inclin
to listen to her after lay out for some compliment of be
deepli regret in their old neighbourhood which ann could not pay
they had onli a few faint enquiri to make befor the talk must be
all their own uppercross excit no interest kellynch veri little:
it wa all bath

they had the pleasur of assur her that bath more than answer
their expect in everi respect their hous wa undoubtedli
the best in camden place; their drawing-room had mani decid advantag
over all the other which they had either seen or heard of
and the superior wa not less in the style of the fitting-up
or the tast of the furnitur their acquaint wa
exceedingli sought after everybodi wa want to visit them
they had drawn back from mani introduct and still were
perpetu have card left by peopl of whom they knew noth

here were fund of enjoy could ann wonder that her father
and sister were happy? she might not wonder but she must sigh
that her father should feel no degrad in hi chang should see
noth to regret in the duti and digniti of the resid landhold
should find so much to be vain of in the littl of a town;
and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open
the folding-door and walk with exult from one drawing-room
to the other boast of their space; at the possibl of that woman
who had been mistress of kellynch hall find extent to be proud of
between two wall perhap thirti feet asund

but thi wa not all which they had to make them happi
they had mr elliot too ann had a great deal to hear of mr elliot
he wa not onli pardon they were delight with him
he had been in bath about a fortnight; (he had pass through bath
in novemb in hi way to london when the intellig of
sir walter be settl there had of cours reach him
though onli twenty-four hour in the place but he had not been abl
to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in bath
and hi first object on arriv had been to leav hi card
in camden place follow it up by such assidu endeavour to meet
and when they did meet by such great open of conduct
such readi to apolog for the past such solicitud to be receiv
as a relat again that their former good understand
wa complet re-establish

they had not a fault to find in him he had explain away
all the appear of neglect on hi own side it had origin
in misapprehens entir he had never had an idea of
throw himself off; he had fear that he wa thrown off
but knew not whi and delicaci had kept him silent upon the hint
of have spoken disrespect or carelessli of the famili
and the famili honour he wa quit indign he who had ever boast
of be an elliot and whose feel as to connect
were onli too strict to suit the unfeud tone of the present day
he wa astonish inde but hi charact and gener conduct
must refut it he could refer sir walter to all who knew him;
and certainli the pain he had been take on thi the first opportun
of reconcili to be restor to the foot of a relat
and heir-presumpt wa a strong proof of hi opinion on the subject

the circumst of hi marriag too were found to admit of
much extenu thi wa an articl not to be enter on by himself;
but a veri intim friend of hi a colonel walli a highli
respect man perfectli the gentleman (and not an ill-look man
sir walter added) who wa live in veri good style in marlborough
build and had at hi own particular request been admit
to their acquaint through mr elliot had mention one or two thing
rel to the marriag which made a materi differ
in the discredit of it

colonel walli had known mr elliot long had been well acquaint
also with hi wife had perfectli understood the whole stori
she wa certainli not a woman of famili but well educ
accomplish rich and excess in love with hi friend
there had been the charm she had sought him without that attract
not all her money would have tempt elliot and sir walter wa
moreov assur of her have been a veri fine woman
here wa a great deal to soften the busi a veri fine woman
with a larg fortun in love with him! sir walter seem to admit it
as complet apology; and though elizabeth could not see the circumst
in quit so favour a light she allow it be a great extenu

mr elliot had call repeatedli had dine with them onc
evid delight by the distinct of be ask for they
gave no dinner in general; delight in short by everi proof
of cousinli notic and place hi whole happi in be
on intim term in camden place

ann listen but without quit understand it allow
larg allow she knew must be made for the idea of those who spoke
she heard it all under embellish all that sound extravag
or irrat in the progress of the reconcili might have no origin
but in the languag of the relat still howev she had
the sensat of there be someth more than immedi appear
in mr elliot wish after an interv of so mani year
to be well receiv by them in a worldli view he had noth to gain
by be on term with sir walter; noth to risk by a state of varianc
in all probabl he wa alreadi the richer of the two
and the kellynch estat would as sure be hi hereaft as the titl
a sensibl man and he had look like a veri sensibl man
whi should it be an object to him? she could onli offer one solution;
it wa perhap for elizabeth sake there might realli have been
a like formerli though conveni and accid had drawn him
a differ way; and now that he could afford to pleas himself
he might mean to pay hi address to her elizabeth wa certainli
veri handsom with well-br eleg manner and her charact
might never have been penetr by mr elliot know her but in public
and when veri young himself how her temper and understand
might bear the investig of hi present keener time of life
wa anoth concern and rather a fear one most earnestli did she wish
that he might not be too nice or too observ if elizabeth
were hi object; and that elizabeth wa dispos to believ herself so
and that her friend mr clay wa encourag the idea seem appar
by a glanc or two between them while mr elliot frequent visit
were talk of

ann mention the glimps she had had of him at lyme but without
be much attend to oh! ye perhap it had been mr elliot
they did not know it might be him perhap they could not listen
to her descript of him they were describ him themselves;
sir walter especi he did justic to hi veri gentlemanlik
appear hi air of eleg and fashion hi good shape face
hi sensibl eye; but at the same time must lament hi be
veri much under-hung a defect which time seem to have increased;
nor could he pretend to say that ten year had not alter
almost everi featur for the wors mr elliot appear to think
that he (sir walter) wa look exactli as he had done when
they last parted; but sir walter had not been abl to return
the compliment entir which had embarrass him he did not mean
to complain howev mr elliot wa better to look at than most men
and he had no object to be seen with him anywher

mr elliot and hi friend in marlborough build were talk of
the whole even colonel walli had been so impati to be
introduc to them! and mr elliot so anxiou that he should!
and there wa a mr walli at present known onli to them by descript
as she wa in daili expect of her confinement; but mr elliot
spoke of her as a most charm woman quit worthi of be known
in camden place and as soon as she recov they were to be acquaint
sir walter thought much of mr wallis; she wa said to be
an excess pretti woman beauti he long to see her
he hope she might make some amend for the mani veri plain face
he wa continu pass in the street the worst of bath wa
the number of it plain women he did not mean to say that there were
no pretti women but the number of the plain wa out of all proport
he had frequent observ as he walk that one handsom face
would be follow by thirti or five-and-thirti frights; and onc
as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had count
eighty-seven women go by one after anoth without there be
a toler face among them it had been a frosti morn
to be sure a sharp frost which hardli one woman in a thousand
could stand the test of but still there certainli were
a dread multitud of ugli women in bath; and as for the men!
they were infinit wors such scarecrow as the street were full of!
it wa evid how littl the women were use to the sight of anyth
toler by the effect which a man of decent appear produc
he had never walk anywher arm-in-arm with colonel walli
(who wa a fine militari figur though sandy-haired) without observ
that everi woman eye wa upon him; everi woman eye wa sure to be
upon colonel walli modest sir walter! he wa not allow
to escap howev hi daughter and mr clay unit in hint
that colonel walliss companion might have as good a figur
as colonel walli and certainli wa not sandy-hair

how is mari looking? said sir walter in the height of hi good humour
the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not
happen everi day

oh! no that must have been quit accident in gener she ha been
in veri good health and veri good look sinc michaelma

if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp wind
and grow coars i would send her a new hat and peliss

ann wa consid whether she should ventur to suggest that a gown
or a cap would not be liabl to ani such misus when a knock at the door
suspend everyth a knock at the door! and so late!
it wa ten oclock could it be mr elliot? they knew he wa to dine
in lansdown crescent it wa possibl that he might stop in hi way home
to ask them how they did they could think of no one els
mr clay decidedli thought it mr elliot knock mr clay wa right
with all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give
mr elliot wa usher into the room

it wa the same the veri same man with no differ but of dress
ann drew a littl back while the other receiv hi compliment
and her sister hi apolog for call at so unusu an hour
but he could not be so near without wish to know that neither she
nor her friend had taken cold the day befor &c &c; which wa
all as polit done and as polit taken as possibl but her part
must follow then sir walter talk of hi youngest daughter;
mr elliot must give him leav to present him to hi youngest daughter
(there wa no occas for rememb mary); and ann smile and
blush veri becomingli shew to mr elliot the pretti featur
which he had by no mean forgotten and instantli saw with amus
at hi littl start of surpris that he had not been at all awar
of who she wa he look complet astonish but not more astonish
than pleased; hi eye brightened! and with the most perfect alacr
he welcom the relationship allud to the past and entreat
to be receiv as an acquaint alreadi he wa quit as good-look
as he had appear at lyme hi counten improv by speak
and hi manner were so exactli what they ought to be so polish
so easi so particularli agreeabl that she could compar them
in excel to onli one person manner they were not the same
but they were perhap equal good

he sat down with them and improv their convers veri much
there could be no doubt of hi be a sensibl man ten minut
were enough to certifi that hi tone hi express
hi choic of subject hi know where to stop; it wa all
the oper of a sensibl discern mind as soon as he could
he began to talk to her of lyme want to compar opinion
respect the place but especi want to speak of the circumst
of their happen to be guest in the same inn at the same time;
to give hi own rout understand someth of her and regret that
he should have lost such an opportun of pay hi respect to her
she gave him a short account of her parti and busi at lyme
hi regret increas as he listen he had spent hi whole
solitari even in the room adjoin theirs; had heard voic
mirth continually; thought they must be a most delight set of peopl
long to be with them but certainli without the smallest suspicion
of hi possess the shadow of a right to introduc himself
if he had but ask who the parti were! the name of musgrov would
have told him enough well it would serv to cure him of
an absurd practic of never ask a question at an inn
which he had adopt when quit a young man on the princip
of it be veri ungenteel to be curiou

the notion of a young man of one or two and twenti said he
as to what is necessari in manner to make him quit the thing
are more absurd i believ than those of ani other set of be
in the world the folli of the mean they often employ
is onli to be equal by the folli of what they have in view

but he must not be address hi reflect to ann alone:
he knew it; he wa soon diffus again among the other
and it wa onli at interv that he could return to lyme

hi enquiri howev produc at length an account of the scene
she had been engag in there soon after hi leav the place
have allud to an accid he must hear the whole
when he question sir walter and elizabeth began to question also
but the differ in their manner of do it could not be unfelt
she could onli compar mr elliot to ladi russel in the wish
of realli comprehend what had pass and in the degre of concern
for what she must have suffer in wit it

he staid an hour with them the eleg littl clock on the mantel-
piec had struck eleven with it silver sound and the watchman
wa begin to be heard at a distanc tell the same tale
befor mr elliot or ani of them seem to feel that he had been there long

ann could not have suppos it possibl that her first even in
camden place could have pass so well!



chapter 16


there wa one point which ann on return to her famili
would have been more thank to ascertain even than mr elliot
be in love with elizabeth which wa her father not be
in love with mr clay; and she wa veri far from easi about it
when she had been at home a few hour on go down to breakfast
the next morn she found there had just been a decent pretenc
on the ladi side of mean to leav them she could imagin mr clay
to have said that now miss ann wa come she could not suppos herself
at all wanted; for elizabeth wa repli in a sort of whisper
that must not be ani reason inde i assur you i feel it none
she is noth to me compar with you; and she wa in full time
to hear her father say my dear madam thi must not be as yet
you have seen noth of bath you have been here onli to be use
you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquaint
with mr walli the beauti mr walli to your fine mind
i well know the sight of beauti is a real gratif

he spoke and look so much in earnest that ann wa not surpris
to see mr clay steal a glanc at elizabeth and herself
her counten perhap might express some watchfulness;
but the prais of the fine mind did not appear to excit a thought
in her sister the ladi could not but yield to such joint entreati
and promis to stay

in the cours of the same morn ann and her father chanc to be
alon togeth he began to compliment her on her improv looks;
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks; her skin
her complexion greatli improved; clearer fresher had she been
use ani thing in particular? no noth mere gowland
he suppos no noth at all ha! he wa surpris at that;
and ad certainli you cannot do better than to continu as you are;
you cannot be better than well; or i should recommend gowland
the constant use of gowland dure the spring month mr clay ha been
use it at my recommend and you see what it ha done for her
you see how it ha carri away her freckl

if elizabeth could but have heard this! such person prais
might have struck her especi as it did not appear to ann
that the freckl were at all lessen but everyth must
take it chanc the evil of a marriag would be much diminish
if elizabeth were also to marri as for herself she might alway
command a home with ladi russel

ladi russel compos mind and polit manner were put to some trial
on thi point in her intercours in camden place the sight of mr clay
in such favour and of ann so overlook wa a perpetu provoc
to her there; and vex her as much when she wa away as a person in bath
who drink the water get all the new public and ha
a veri larg acquaint ha time to be vex

as mr elliot becam known to her she grew more charit
or more indiffer toward the other hi manner were
an immedi recommendation; and on convers with him she found
the solid so fulli support the superfici that she wa at first
as she told ann almost readi to exclaim can thi be mr elliot?
and could not serious pictur to herself a more agreeabl
or estim man everyth unit in him; good understand
correct opinion knowledg of the world and a warm heart
he had strong feel of famili attach and famili honour
without pride or weakness; he live with the liber of a man of fortun
without display; he judg for himself in everyth essenti
without defi public opinion in ani point of worldli decorum
he wa steadi observ moder candid; never run away with by spirit
or by selfish which fanci itself strong feeling; and yet
with a sensibl to what wa amiabl and love and a valu
for all the felic of domest life which charact of
fanci enthusiasm and violent agit seldom realli possess
she wa sure that he had not been happi in marriag colonel walli
said it and ladi russel saw it; but it had been no unhappi
to sour hi mind nor (she began pretti soon to suspect) to prevent hi
think of a second choic her satisfact in mr elliot
outweigh all the plagu of mr clay

it wa now some year sinc ann had begun to learn that she
and her excel friend could sometim think differently;
and it did not surpris her therefor that ladi russel
should see noth suspici or inconsist noth to requir
more motiv than appear in mr elliot great desir of a reconcili
in ladi russel view it wa perfectli natur that mr elliot
at a matur time of life should feel it a most desir object
and what would veri gener recommend him among all sensibl peopl
to be on good term with the head of hi family; the simplest process
in the world of time upon a head natur clear and onli er
in the heyday of youth ann presum howev still to smile about it
and at last to mention elizabeth ladi russel listen and look
and made onli thi cautiou reply:--elizabeth! veri well;
time will explain

it wa a refer to the futur which ann after a littl observ
felt she must submit to she could determin noth at present
in that hous elizabeth must be first; and she wa in the habit
of such gener observ as miss elliot that ani particular
of attent seem almost imposs mr elliot too
it must be rememb had not been a widow seven month
a littl delay on hi side might be veri excus in fact
ann could never see the crape round hi hat without fear that
she wa the inexcus one in attribut to him such imaginations;
for though hi marriag had not been veri happi still it had exist
so mani year that she could not comprehend a veri rapid recoveri
from the aw impress of it be dissolv

howev it might end he wa without ani question their
pleasantest acquaint in bath: she saw nobodi equal to him;
and it wa a great indulg now and then to talk to him about lyme
which he seem to have as live a wish to see again and to see more of
as herself they went through the particular of their first meet
a great mani time he gave her to understand that he had
look at her with some earnest she knew it well;
and she rememb anoth person look also

they did not alway think alik hi valu for rank and connexion
she perceiv wa greater than her it wa not mere complais
it must be a like to the caus which made him enter warmli
into her father and sister solicitud on a subject which
she thought unworthi to excit them the bath paper one morn
announc the arriv of the dowag viscountess dalrympl
and her daughter the honour miss carteret; and all the comfort
of no-- camden place wa swept away for mani days; for the dalrympl
(in ann opinion most unfortunately) were cousin of the elliots;
and the agoni wa how to introduc themselv properli

ann had never seen her father and sister befor in contact with nobil
and she must acknowledg herself disappoint she had hope
better thing from their high idea of their own situat in life
and wa reduc to form a wish which she had never foreseen;
a wish that they had more pride; for our cousin ladi dalrympl
and miss carteret; our cousin the dalrympl sound in her ear
all day long

sir walter had onc been in compani with the late viscount
but had never seen ani of the rest of the family; and the difficulti
of the case aros from there have been a suspens of all intercours
by letter of ceremoni ever sinc the death of that said late viscount
when in consequ of a danger ill of sir walter
at the same time there had been an unlucki omiss at kellynch
no letter of condol had been sent to ireland the neglect
had been visit on the head of the sinner; for when poor ladi elliot
die herself no letter of condol wa receiv at kellynch
and consequ there wa but too much reason to apprehend
that the dalrympl consid the relationship as close
how to have thi anxiou busi set to right and be admit
as cousin again wa the question: and it wa a question which
in a more ration manner neither ladi russel nor mr elliot
thought unimport famili connexion were alway worth preserv
good compani alway worth seeking; ladi dalrympl had taken a hous
for three month in laura place and would be live in style
she had been at bath the year befor and ladi russel had heard her
spoken of as a charm woman it wa veri desir that
the connexion should be renew if it could be done without ani
compromis of proprieti on the side of the elliot

sir walter howev would choos hi own mean and at last wrote
a veri fine letter of ampl explan regret and entreati
to hi right honour cousin neither ladi russel nor mr elliot
could admir the letter; but it did all that wa want
in bring three line of scrawl from the dowag viscountess
she wa veri much honour and should be happi in their acquaint
the toil of the busi were over the sweet began they visit
in laura place they had the card of dowag viscountess dalrympl
and the honour miss carteret to be arrang wherev they might
be most visible: and our cousin in laura place--our cousin
ladi dalrympl and miss carteret were talk of to everybodi

ann wa asham had ladi dalrympl and her daughter even been
veri agreeabl she would still have been asham of the agit
they creat but they were noth there wa no superior of manner
accomplish or understand ladi dalrympl had acquir
the name of a charm woman becaus she had a smile and a civil answer
for everybodi miss carteret with still less to say wa so plain
and so awkward that she would never have been toler in camden place
but for her birth

ladi russel confess she had expect someth better; but yet
it wa an acquaint worth having; and when ann ventur to speak
her opinion of them to mr elliot he agre to their be noth
in themselv but still maintain that as a famili connexion
as good compani as those who would collect good compani around them
they had their valu ann smile and said

my idea of good compani mr elliot is the compani of clever
well-inform peopl who have a great deal of conversation;
that is what i call good compani

you are mistaken said he gentli that is not good company;
that is the best good compani requir onli birth educ
and manner and with regard to educ is not veri nice
birth and good manner are essential; but a littl learn is
by no mean a danger thing in good company; on the contrari
it will do veri well my cousin ann shake her head
she is not satisfi she is fastidi my dear cousin
(sit down by her) you have a better right to be fastidi
than almost ani other woman i know; but will it answer?
will it make you happy? will it not be wiser to accept the societi
of those good ladi in laura place and enjoy all the advantag
of the connexion as far as possible? you may depend upon it
that they will move in the first set in bath thi winter
and as rank is rank your be known to be relat to them
will have it use in fix your famili (our famili let me say)
in that degre of consider which we must all wish for

ye sigh ann we shall inde be known to be relat to them!
then recollect herself and not wish to be answer she ad
i certainli do think there ha been by far too much troubl taken
to procur the acquaint i suppos (smiling) i have more pride
than ani of you; but i confess it doe vex me that we should be
so solicit to have the relationship acknowledg which we may
be veri sure is a matter of perfect indiffer to them

pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claim
in london perhap in your present quiet style of live
it might be as you say: but in bath; sir walter elliot and hi famili
will alway be worth knowing: alway accept as acquaint

well said ann i certainli am proud too proud to enjoy a welcom
which depend so entir upon place

i love your indign said he; it is veri natur
but here you are in bath and the object is to be establish here
with all the credit and digniti which ought to belong to sir walter elliot
you talk of be proud; i am call proud i know and i shall not wish
to believ myself otherwise; for our pride if investig
would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem
a littl differ in one point i am sure my dear cousin
(he continu speak lower though there wa no one els in the room)
in one point i am sure we must feel alik we must feel that
everi addit to your father societi among hi equal or superior
may be of use in divert hi thought from those who are beneath him

he look as he spoke to the seat which mr clay had been
late occupying: a suffici explan of what he particularli meant;
and though ann could not believ in their have the same sort of pride
she wa pleas with him for not like mr clay; and her conscienc
admit that hi wish to promot her father get
great acquaint wa more than excus in the view of defeat her



chapter 17


while sir walter and elizabeth were assidu push their
good fortun in laura place ann wa renew an acquaint
of a veri differ descript

she had call on her former gover and had heard from her
of there be an old school-fellow in bath who had the two strong claim
on her attent of past kind and present suffer miss hamilton
now mr smith had shewn her kind in one of those period of her life
when it had been most valuabl ann had gone unhappi to school
griev for the loss of a mother whom she had dearli love
feel her separ from home and suffer as a girl of fourteen
of strong sensibl and not high spirit must suffer at such a time;
and miss hamilton three year older than herself but still from the want
of near relat and a settl home remain anoth year at school
had been use and good to her in a way which had consider lessen
her miseri and could never be rememb with indiffer

miss hamilton had left school had marri not long afterward
wa said to have marri a man of fortun and thi wa all
that ann had known of her till now that their governesss account
brought her situat forward in a more decid but veri differ form

she wa a widow and poor her husband had been extravagant;
and at hi death about two year befor had left hi affair
dread involv she had had difficulti of everi sort
to contend with and in addit to these distress had been afflict
with a sever rheumat fever which final settl in her leg
had made her for the present a crippl she had come to bath
on that account and wa now in lodg near the hot bath
live in a veri humbl way unabl even to afford herself
the comfort of a servant and of cours almost exclud from societi

their mutual friend answer for the satisfact which a visit
from miss elliot would give mr smith and ann therefor
lost no time in go she mention noth of what she had heard
or what she intend at home it would excit no proper interest there
she onli consult ladi russel who enter thoroughli into her sentiment
and wa most happi to convey her as near to mr smith lodg
in westgat build as ann chose to be taken

the visit wa paid their acquaint re-establish their interest
in each other more than re-kindl the first ten minut
had it awkward and it emot twelv year were gone
sinc they had part and each present a somewhat differ person
from what the other had imagin twelv year had chang ann
from the bloom silent unform girl of fifteen to the eleg
littl woman of seven-and-twenti with everi beauti except bloom
and with manner as conscious right as they were invari gentle;
and twelv year had transform the fine-look well-grown miss hamilton
in all the glow of health and confid of superior into a poor
infirm helpless widow receiv the visit of her former protege
as a favour; but all that wa uncomfort in the meet had soon
pass away and left onli the interest charm of rememb
former partial and talk over old time

ann found in mr smith the good sens and agreeabl manner which
she had almost ventur to depend on and a disposit to convers
and be cheer beyond her expect neither the dissip
of the past--and she had live veri much in the world--nor the restrict
of the present neither sick nor sorrow seem to have
close her heart or ruin her spirit

in the cours of a second visit she talk with great open
and ann astonish increas she could scarc imagin
a more cheerless situat in itself than mr smith she had been
veri fond of her husband: she had buri him she had been
use to affluence: it wa gone she had no child to connect her
with life and happi again no relat to assist in the arrang
of perplex affair no health to make all the rest support
her accommod were limit to a noisi parlour and a dark bedroom
behind with no possibl of move from one to the other without
assist which there wa onli one servant in the hous to afford
and she never quit the hous but to be convey into the warm bath
yet in spite of all thi ann had reason to believ that she had
moment onli of languor and depress to hour of occup
and enjoy how could it be? she watch observ reflect
and final determin that thi wa not a case of fortitud
or of resign onli a submiss spirit might be patient
a strong understand would suppli resolut but here wa someth more;
here wa that elast of mind that disposit to be comfort
that power of turn readili from evil to good and of find employ
which carri her out of herself which wa from natur alon
it wa the choicest gift of heaven; and ann view her friend
as one of those instanc in which by a merci appoint
it seem design to counterbal almost everi other want

there had been a time mr smith told her when her spirit
had nearli fail she could not call herself an invalid now
compar with her state on first reach bath then she had inde
been a pitiabl object; for she had caught cold on the journey
and had hardli taken possess of her lodg befor she wa again
confin to her bed and suffer under sever and constant pain;
and all thi among stranger with the absolut necess of have
a regular nurs and financ at that moment particularli unfit
to meet ani extraordinari expens she had weather it howev
and could truli say that it had done her good it had increas
her comfort by make her feel herself to be in good hand
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterest
attach anywher but her ill had prove to her that her landladi
had a charact to preserv and would not use her ill; and she had been
particularli fortun in her nurs as a sister of her landladi
a nurs by profess and who had alway a home in that hous
when unemploy chanc to be at liberti just in time to attend her
and she said mr smith besid nurs me most admir
ha realli prove an invalu acquaint as soon as i could
use my hand she taught me to knit which ha been a great amusement;
and she put me in the way of make these littl thread-cas
pin-cushion and card-rack which you alway find me so busi about
and which suppli me with the mean of do a littl good
to one or two veri poor famili in thi neighbourhood
she had a larg acquaint of cours profession among those
who can afford to buy and she dispos of my merchandis
she alway take the right time for appli everybodi heart is open
you know when they have recent escap from sever pain
or are recov the bless of health and nurs rook
thoroughli understand when to speak she is a shrewd intellig
sensibl woman her is a line for see human nature; and she ha
a fund of good sens and observ which as a companion make her
infinit superior to thousand of those who have onli receiv
`the best educ in the world know noth worth attend to
call it gossip if you will but when nurs rook ha half an hour
leisur to bestow on me she is sure to have someth to relat
that is entertain and profitable: someth that make one
know one speci better one like to hear what is go on
to be au fait as to the newest mode of be trifl and silli
to me who live so much alon her convers i assur you is a treat

ann far from wish to cavil at the pleasur repli
i can easili believ it women of that class have great opportun
and if they are intellig may be well worth listen to
such varieti of human natur as they are in the habit of witnessing!
and it is not mere in it folli that they are well read;
for they see it occasion under everi circumst that can be
most interest or affect what instanc must pass befor them
of ardent disinterest self-deni attach of heroism fortitud
patienc resignation: of all the conflict and all the sacrific
that ennobl us most a sick chamber may often furnish
the worth of volum

ye said mr smith more doubtingli sometim it may
though i fear it lesson are not often in the elev style you describ
here and there human natur may be great in time of trial;
but gener speak it is it weak and not it strength
that appear in a sick chamber: it is selfish and impati
rather than generos and fortitud that one hear of
there is so littl real friendship in the world! and unfortun
(speak low and tremulously) there are so mani who forget
to think serious till it is almost too late

ann saw the miseri of such feel the husband had not been
what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind
which made her think wors of the world than she hope it deserv
it wa but a pass emot howev with mr smith; she shook it off
and soon ad in a differ tone--

i do not suppos the situat my friend mr rook is in at present
will furnish much either to interest or edifi me she is onli nurs
mr walli of marlborough buildings; a mere pretti silli expens
fashion woman i believe; and of cours will have noth to report
but of lace and fineri i mean to make my profit of mr walli howev
she ha plenti of money and i intend she shall buy all
the high-pric thing i have in hand now

ann had call sever time on her friend befor the exist
of such a person wa known in camden place at last it becam necessari
to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mr clay return one morn
from laura place with a sudden invit from ladi dalrympl
for the same even and ann wa alreadi engag to spend that even
in westgat build she wa not sorri for the excus
they were onli ask she wa sure becaus ladi dalrympl be
kept at home by a bad cold wa glad to make use of the relationship
which had been so press on her; and she declin on her own account
with great alacrity--sh wa engag to spend the even
with an old schoolfellow they were not much interest in anyth
rel to anne; but still there were question enough ask
to make it understood what thi old schoolfellow was; and elizabeth
wa disdain and sir walter sever

westgat buildings! said he and who is miss ann elliot
to be visit in westgat buildings? a mr smith a widow mr smith;
and who wa her husband? one of five thousand mr smith whose name
are to be met with everywher and what is her attraction?
that she is old and sickli upon my word miss ann elliot
you have the most extraordinari taste! everyth that revolt
other peopl low compani paltri room foul air disgust associ
are invit to you but sure you may put off thi old ladi
till to-morrow: she is not so near her end i presum
but that she may hope to see anoth day what is her age? forty?

no sir she is not one-and-thirty; but i do not think i can
put off my engag becaus it is the onli even for some time
which will at onc suit her and myself she goe into the warm bath
to-morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engag

but what doe ladi russel think of thi acquaintance? ask elizabeth

she see noth to blame in it repli anne; on the contrari
she approv it and ha gener taken me when i have
call on mr smith

westgat build must have been rather surpris by the appear
of a carriag drawn up near it pavement observ sir walter
sir henri russel widow inde ha no honour to distinguish her arm
but still it is a handsom equipag and no doubt is well known
to convey a miss elliot a widow mr smith lodg in westgat buildings!
a poor widow bare abl to live between thirti and forty;
a mere mr smith an every-day mr smith of all peopl and all name
in the world to be the chosen friend of miss ann elliot
and to be prefer by her to her own famili connect among the nobil
of england and ireland! mr smith! such a name!

mr clay who had been present while all thi pass now thought it
advis to leav the room and ann could have said much
and did long to say a littl in defenc of her friend
not veri dissimilar claim to their but her sens of person respect
to her father prevent her she made no repli she left it
to himself to recollect that mr smith wa not the onli widow
in bath between thirti and forti with littl to live on
and no surnam of digniti

ann kept her appointment; the other kept their and of cours
she heard the next morn that they had had a delight even
she had been the onli one of the set absent for sir walter
and elizabeth had not onli been quit at her ladyship servic themselv
but had actual been happi to be employ by her in collect other
and had been at the troubl of invit both ladi russel and mr elliot;
and mr elliot had made a point of leav colonel walli earli
and ladi russel had fresh arrang all her even engag
in order to wait on her ann had the whole histori of all that
such an even could suppli from ladi russel to her
it greatest interest must be in have been veri much talk of
between her friend and mr elliot; in have been wish for regret
and at the same time honour for stay away in such a caus
her kind compassion visit to thi old schoolfellow
sick and reduc seem to have quit delight mr elliot
he thought her a most extraordinari young woman; in her temper manner
mind a model of femal excel he could meet even ladi russel
in a discuss of her merits; and ann could not be given to understand
so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highli rate
by a sensibl man without mani of those agreeabl sensat
which her friend meant to creat

ladi russel wa now perfectli decid in her opinion of mr elliot
she wa as much convinc of hi mean to gain ann in time as of
hi deserv her and wa begin to calcul the number of week
which would free him from all the remain restraint of widowhood
and leav him at liberti to exert hi most open power of pleas
she would not speak to ann with half the certainti she felt on the subject
she would ventur on littl more than hint of what might be hereaft
of a possibl attach on hi side of the desir of the allianc
suppos such attach to be real and return ann heard her
and made no violent exclamations; she onli smile blush
and gentli shook her head

i am no match-mak as you well know said ladi russel
be much too well awar of the uncertainti of all human event
and calcul i onli mean that if mr elliot should some time henc
pay hi address to you and if you should be dispos to accept him
i think there would be everi possibl of your be happi togeth
a most suitabl connect everybodi must consid it but i think
it might be a veri happi one

mr elliot is an exceedingli agreeabl man and in mani respect
i think highli of him said anne; but we should not suit

ladi russel let thi pass and onli said in rejoind i own that
to be abl to regard you as the futur mistress of kellynch
the futur ladi elliot to look forward and see you occupi
your dear mother place succeed to all her right
and all her popular as well as to all her virtu would be
the highest possibl gratif to me you are your mother self
in counten and disposition; and if i might be allow to fanci you
such as she wa in situat and name and home presid and bless
in the same spot and onli superior to her in be more highli valued!
my dearest ann it would give me more delight than is often felt
at my time of life!

ann wa oblig to turn away to rise to walk to a distant tabl
and lean there in pretend employ tri to subdu the feel
thi pictur excit for a few moment her imagin and her heart
were bewitch the idea of becom what her mother had been;
of have the preciou name of ladi elliot first reviv in herself;
of be restor to kellynch call it her home again
her home for ever wa a charm which she could not immedi resist
ladi russel said not anoth word will to leav the matter
to it own operation; and believ that could mr elliot at that moment
with proprieti have spoken for himself!--sh believ in short
what ann did not believ the same imag of mr elliot speak
for himself brought ann to composur again the charm of kellynch
and of ladi elliot all fade away she never could accept him
and it wa not onli that her feel were still advers to ani man
save one; her judgement on a seriou consider of the possibl
of such a case wa against mr elliot

though they had now been acquaint a month she could not be satisfi
that she realli knew hi charact that he wa a sensibl man
an agreeabl man that he talk well profess good opinion
seem to judg properli and as a man of principl thi wa all
clear enough he certainli knew what wa right nor could she fix
on ani one articl of moral duti evid transgressed; but yet she would
have been afraid to answer for hi conduct she distrust the past
if not the present the name which occasion dropt
of former associ the allus to former practic and pursuit
suggest suspicion not favour of what he had been
she saw that there had been bad habits; that sunday travel
had been a common thing; that there had been a period of hi life
(and probabl not a short one) when he had been at least
careless in all seriou matters; and though he might now think
veri differ who could answer for the true sentiment of a clever
cautiou man grown old enough to appreci a fair character?
how could it ever be ascertain that hi mind wa truli cleansed?

mr elliot wa ration discreet polish but he wa not open
there wa never ani burst of feel ani warmth of indign or delight
at the evil or good of other thi to ann wa a decid imperfect
her earli impress were incur she prize the frank
the open-heart the eager charact beyond all other
warmth and enthusiasm did captiv her still she felt that she could
so much more depend upon the sincer of those who sometim look
or said a careless or a hasti thing than of those whose presenc of mind
never vari whose tongu never slip

mr elliot wa too gener agreeabl variou as were the temper
in her father hous he pleas them all he endur too well
stood too well with everi bodi he had spoken to her with some
degre of open of mr clay; had appear complet to see
what mr clay wa about and to hold her in contempt; and yet
mr clay found him as agreeabl as ani bodi

ladi russel saw either less or more than her young friend
for she saw noth to excit distrust she could not imagin
a man more exactli what he ought to be than mr elliot; nor did she
ever enjoy a sweeter feel than the hope of see him receiv
the hand of her belov ann in kellynch church in the cours of
the follow autumn



chapter 18


it wa the begin of february; and ann have been a month in bath
wa grow veri eager for news from uppercross and lyme
she want to hear much more than mari had commun
it wa three week sinc she had heard at all she onli knew
that henrietta wa at home again; and that louisa though consid to be
recov fast wa still in lyme; and she wa think of them all
veri intent one even when a thicker letter than usual from mari
wa deliv to her; and to quicken the pleasur and surpris
with admir and mr croft compliment

the croft must be in bath! a circumst to interest her
they were peopl whom her heart turn to veri natur

what is this? cri sir walter the croft have arriv in bath?
the croft who rent kellynch? what have they brought you?

a letter from uppercross cottag sir

oh! those letter are conveni passport they secur an introduct
i should have visit admir croft howev at ani rate
i know what is due to my tenant

ann could listen no longer; she could not even have told how
the poor admir complexion escaped; her letter engross her
it had been begun sever day back


februari 1st

my dear anne--i make no apolog for my silenc becaus i know
how littl peopl think of letter in such a place as bath
you must be a great deal too happi to care for uppercross which
as you well know afford littl to write about we have had
a veri dull christmas; mr and mr musgrov have not had one dinner parti
all the holiday i do not reckon the hayter as anybodi
the holiday howev are over at last: i believ no children ever had
such long one i am sure i had not the hous wa clear yesterday
except of the littl harvilles; but you will be surpris to hear
they have never gone home mr harvil must be an odd mother
to part with them so long i do not understand it they are
not at all nice children in my opinion; but mr musgrov seem to
like them quit as well if not better than her grandchildren
what dread weather we have had! it may not be felt in bath
with your nice pavements; but in the countri it is of some consequ
i have not had a creatur call on me sinc the second week in januari
except charl hayter who had been call much often than wa welcom
between ourselv i think it a great piti henrietta did not remain at lyme
as long as louisa; it would have kept her a littl out of hi way
the carriag is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvil to-morrow
we are not ask to dine with them howev till the day after
mr musgrov is so afraid of her be fatigu by the journey
which is not veri like consid the care that will be taken of her;
and it would be much more conveni to me to dine there to-morrow
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeabl and wish i could be acquaint
with him too; but i have my usual luck: i am alway out of the way
when ani thing desir is go on; alway the last of my famili
to be notic what an immens time mr clay ha been stay
with elizabeth! doe she never mean to go away? but perhap
if she were to leav the room vacant we might not be invit
let me know what you think of thi i do not expect my children
to be ask you know i can leav them at the great hous veri well
for a month or six week i have thi moment heard that the croft
are go to bath almost immediately; they think the admir gouti
charl heard it quit by chance; they have not had the civil
to give me ani notic or of offer to take anyth
i do not think they improv at all as neighbour we see noth of them
and thi is realli an instanc of gross inattent charl join me
in love and everyth proper your affection

mari m---

i am sorri to say that i am veri far from well; and jemima ha
just told me that the butcher say there is a bad sore-throat
veri much about i dare say i shall catch it; and my sore-throat
you know are alway wors than anybodi


so end the first part which had been afterward put into an envelop
contain nearli as much more


i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa
bore her journey and now i am extrem glad i did have a great deal
to add in the first place i had a note from mr croft yesterday
offer to convey anyth to you; a veri kind friendli note inde
address to me just as it ought; i shall therefor be abl to
make my letter as long as i like the admir doe not seem veri ill
and i sincer hope bath will do him all the good he want
i shall be truli glad to have them back again our neighbourhood
cannot spare such a pleasant famili but now for louisa
i have someth to commun that will astonish you not a littl
she and the harvil came on tuesday veri safe and in the even
we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surpris
not to find captain benwick of the parti for he had been invit
as well as the harvilles; and what do you think wa the reason?
neither more nor less than hi be in love with louisa
and not choos to ventur to uppercross till he had had an answer
from mr musgrove; for it wa all settl between him and her
befor she came away and he had written to her father by captain harvil
true upon my honour! are not you astonished? i shall be surpris
at least if you ever receiv a hint of it for i never did
mr musgrov protest solemnli that she knew noth of the matter
we are all veri well pleas howev for though it is not equal to her
marri captain wentworth it is infinit better than charl hayter;
and mr musgrov ha written hi consent and captain benwick
is expect to-day mr harvil say her husband feel a good deal
on hi poor sister account; but howev louisa is a great favourit
with both inde mr harvil and i quit agre that we love her
the better for have nurs her charl wonder what captain wentworth
will say; but if you rememb i never thought him attach to louisa;
i never could see anyth of it and thi is the end you see
of captain benwick be suppos to be an admir of your
how charl could take such a thing into hi head wa alway
incomprehens to me i hope he will be more agreeabl now
certainli not a great match for louisa musgrov but a million time better
than marri among the hayter


mari need not have fear her sister be in ani degre prepar
for the news she had never in her life been more astonish
captain benwick and louisa musgrove! it wa almost too wonder
for belief and it wa with the greatest effort that she could remain
in the room preserv an air of calm and answer the common question
of the moment happili for her they were not mani sir walter
want to know whether the croft travel with four hors
and whether they were like to be situat in such a part of bath
as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in; but had
littl curios beyond

how is mary? said elizabeth; and without wait for an answer
and pray what bring the croft to bath?

they come on the admir account he is thought to be gouti

gout and decrepitude! said sir walter poor old gentleman

have they ani acquaint here? ask elizabeth

i do not know; but i can hardli suppos that at admir croft
time of life and in hi profess he should not have mani acquaint
in such a place as thi

i suspect said sir walter coolli that admir croft
will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall
elizabeth may we ventur to present him and hi wife in laura place?

oh no! i think not situat as we are with ladi dalrympl cousin
we ought to be veri care not to embarrass her with acquaint
she might not approv if we were not relat it would not signify;
but as cousin she would feel scrupul as to ani propos of our
we had better leav the croft to find their own level
there are sever odd-look men walk about here who
i am told are sailor the croft will associ with them

thi wa sir walter and elizabeth share of interest in the letter;
when mr clay had paid her tribut of more decent attent
in an enquiri after mr charl musgrov and her fine littl boy
ann wa at liberti

in her own room she tri to comprehend it well might charl wonder
how captain wentworth would feel! perhap he had quit the field
had given louisa up had ceas to love had found he did not love her
she could not endur the idea of treacheri or leviti or anyth
akin to ill usag between him and hi friend she could not endur
that such a friendship as their should be sever unfairli

captain benwick and louisa musgrove! the high-spirit
joyous-talk louisa musgrov and the deject think
feel read captain benwick seem each of them everyth
that would not suit the other their mind most dissimilar!
where could have been the attraction? the answer soon present itself
it had been in situat they had been thrown togeth sever weeks;
they had been live in the same small famili party: sinc henrietta
come away they must have been depend almost entir on each other
and louisa just recov from ill had been in an interest state
and captain benwick wa not inconsol that wa a point which ann
had not been abl to avoid suspect before; and instead of draw
the same conclus as mari from the present cours of event
they serv onli to confirm the idea of hi have felt some
dawn of tender toward herself she did not mean howev
to deriv much more from it to gratifi her vaniti than mari
might have allow she wa persuad that ani toler pleas
young woman who had listen and seem to feel for him would have
receiv the same compliment he had an affection heart
he must love somebodi

she saw no reason against their be happi louisa had fine
naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alik
he would gain cheer and she would learn to be an enthusiast
for scott and lord byron; nay that wa probabl learnt already;
of cours they had fallen in love over poetri the idea of
louisa musgrov turn into a person of literari tast
and sentiment reflect wa amus but she had no doubt
of it be so the day at lyme the fall from the cobb
might influenc her health her nerv her courag her charact to
the end of her life as thoroughli as it appear to have
influenc her fate

the conclus of the whole wa that if the woman who had been sensibl
of captain wentworth merit could be allow to prefer anoth man
there wa noth in the engag to excit last wonder;
and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainli noth
to be regret no it wa not regret which made ann heart
beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheek
when she thought of captain wentworth unshackl and free
she had some feel which she wa asham to investig
they were too much like joy senseless joy!

she long to see the crofts; but when the meet took place
it wa evid that no rumour of the news had yet reach them
the visit of ceremoni wa paid and returned; and louisa musgrov
wa mention and captain benwick too without even half a smile

the croft had place themselv in lodg in gay street
perfectli to sir walter satisfact he wa not at all asham
of the acquaint and did in fact think and talk a great deal more
about the admir than the admir ever thought or talk about him

the croft knew quit as mani peopl in bath as they wish for
and consid their intercours with the elliot as a mere matter of form
and not in the least like to afford them ani pleasur
they brought with them their countri habit of be almost alway togeth
he wa order to walk to keep off the gout and mr croft
seem to go share with him in everyth and to walk
for her life to do him good ann saw them wherev she went
ladi russel took her out in her carriag almost everi morn
and she never fail to think of them and never fail to see them
know their feel as she did it wa a most attract pictur
of happi to her she alway watch them as long as she could
delight to fanci she understood what they might be talk of
as they walk along in happi independ or equal delight
to see the admir hearti shake of the hand when he encount
an old friend and observ their eager of convers
when occasion form into a littl knot of the navi mr croft
look as intellig and keen as ani of the offic around her

ann wa too much engag with ladi russel to be often walk herself;
but it so happen that one morn about a week or ten day
after the croft arriv it suit her best to leav her friend
or her friend carriag in the lower part of the town
and return alon to camden place and in walk up milsom street
she had the good fortun to meet with the admir he wa stand
by himself at a printshop window with hi hand behind him
in earnest contempl of some print and she not onli might have
pass him unseen but wa oblig to touch as well as address him
befor she could catch hi notic when he did perceiv and
acknowledg her howev it wa done with all hi usual frank
and good humour ha! is it you? thank you thank you
thi is treat me like a friend here i am you see
stare at a pictur i can never get by thi shop without stop
but what a thing here is by way of a boat! do look at it
did you ever see the like? what queer fellow your fine painter must be
to think that anybodi would ventur their live in such a shapeless
old cockleshel as that? and yet here are two gentlemen
stuck up in it mightili at their eas and look about them at the rock
and mountain as if they were not to be upset the next moment
which they certainli must be i wonder where that boat wa built!
(laugh heartily); i would not ventur over a horsepond in it
well (turn away) now where are you bound? can i go anywher
for you or with you? can i be of ani use?

none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasur of your compani
the littl way our road lie togeth i am go home

as we go along there take my arm; that right; i do not
feel comfort if i have not a woman there lord! what a boat it is!
take a last look at the pictur as they began to be in motion

did you say that you had someth to tell me sir?

ye i have present but here come a friend captain brigden;
i shall onli say `how dye do? as we pass howev i shall not stop
`how dye do? brigden stare to see anybodi with me but my wife
she poor soul is tie by the leg she ha a blister on one of her heel
as larg as a three-shil piec if you look across the street
you will see admir brand come down and hi brother shabbi fellow
both of them! i am glad they are not on thi side of the way
sophi cannot bear them they play me a piti trick once:
got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole stori
anoth time there come old sir archibald drew and hi grandson
look he see us; he kiss hi hand to you; he take you for my wife
ah! the peac ha come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald!
how do you like bath miss elliot? it suit us veri well
we are alway meet with some old friend or other; the street
full of them everi morning; sure to have plenti of chat;
and then we get away from them all and shut ourselv in our lodg
and draw in our chair and are snug as if we were at kellynch
ay or as we use to be even at north yarmouth and deal
we do not like our lodg here the wors i can tell you
for put us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth
the wind blow through one of the cupboard just in the same way

when they were got a littl farther ann ventur to press again
for what he had to commun she hope when clear of milsom street
to have her curios gratified; but she wa still oblig to wait
for the admir had made up hi mind not to begin till they had
gain the greater space and quiet of belmont; and as she wa
not realli mr croft she must let him have hi own way
as soon as they were fairli ascend belmont he began--

well now you shall hear someth that will surpris you
but first of all you must tell me the name of the young ladi
i am go to talk about that young ladi you know that we have
all been so concern for the miss musgrov that all thi ha been
happen to her christian name: i alway forget her christian name

ann had been asham to appear to comprehend so soon as she realli
did; but now she could safe suggest the name of louisa

ay ay miss louisa musgrov that is the name i wish young ladi
had not such a number of fine christian name i should never be out
if they were all sophi or someth of that sort well
thi miss louisa we all thought you know wa to marri frederick
he wa court her week after week the onli wonder wa
what they could be wait for till the busi at lyme came;
then inde it wa clear enough that they must wait till her brain
wa set to right but even then there wa someth odd in their
way of go on instead of stay at lyme he went off to plymouth
and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead
he wa gone down to edward and there he ha been ever sinc
we have seen noth of him sinc novemb even sophi could
not understand it but now the matter ha take the strangest turn of all;
for thi young ladi the same miss musgrov instead of be
to marri frederick is to marri jame benwick you know jame benwick

a littl i am a littl acquaint with captain benwick

well she is to marri him nay most like they are marri alreadi
for i do not know what they should wait for

i thought captain benwick a veri pleas young man said ann
and i understand that he bear an excel charact

oh! ye ye there is not a word to be said against jame benwick
he is onli a command it is true made last summer and these are
bad time for get on but he ha not anoth fault that i know of
an excel good-heart fellow i assur you; a veri activ
zealou offic too which is more than you would think for perhap
for that soft sort of manner doe not do him justic

inde you are mistaken there sir; i should never augur want of spirit
from captain benwick manner i thought them particularli pleas
and i will answer for it they would gener pleas

well well ladi are the best judges; but jame benwick is rather too
piano for me; and though veri like it is all our partial
sophi and i cannot help think frederick manner better than hi
there is someth about frederick more to our tast

ann wa caught she had onli meant to oppos the too common idea
of spirit and gentl be incompat with each other
not at all to repres captain benwick manner as the veri best
that could possibl be; and after a littl hesit
she wa begin to say i wa not enter into ani comparison
of the two friend but the admir interrupt her with--

and the thing is certainli true it is not a mere bit of gossip
we have it from frederick himself hi sister had a letter
from him yesterday in which he tell us of it and he had just had it
in a letter from harvil written upon the spot from uppercross
i fanci they are all at uppercross

thi wa an opportun which ann could not resist; she said therefor
i hope admir i hope there is noth in the style of captain
wentworth letter to make you and mr croft particularli uneasi
it did seem last autumn as if there were an attach between him
and louisa musgrove; but i hope it may be understood to have worn out
on each side equal and without violenc i hope hi letter
doe not breath the spirit of an ill-us man

not at all not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur
from begin to end

ann look down to hide her smile

no no; frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he ha
too much spirit for that if the girl like anoth man better
it is veri fit she should have him

certainli but what i mean is that i hope there is noth
in captain wentworth manner of write to make you suppos
he think himself ill-us by hi friend which might appear
you know without it be absolut said i should be veri sorri
that such a friendship as ha subsist between him and captain benwick
should be destroy or even wound by a circumst of thi sort

ye ye i understand you but there is noth at all of that natur
in the letter he doe not give the least fling at benwick;
doe not so much as say `i wonder at it i have a reason of my own
for wonder at it no you would not guess from hi way of write
that he had ever thought of thi miss (what her name?) for himself
he veri handsom hope they will be happi together; and there is
noth veri unforgiv in that i think

ann did not receiv the perfect convict which the admir meant
to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiri farther
she therefor satisfi herself with common-plac remark or quiet
attent and the admir had it all hi own way

poor frederick! said he at last now he must begin all over again
with somebodi els i think we must get him to bath sophi must write
and beg him to come to bath here are pretti girl enough i am sure
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other
miss musgrov i find is bespok by her cousin the young parson
do not you think miss elliot we had better tri to get him to bath?



chapter 19


while admir croft wa take thi walk with ann and express
hi wish of get captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth
wa alreadi on hi way thither befor mr croft had written
he wa arriv and the veri next time ann walk out she saw him

mr elliot wa attend hi two cousin and mr clay they were
in milsom street it began to rain not much but enough to
make shelter desir for women and quit enough to make it
veri desir for miss elliot to have the advantag of be
convey home in ladi dalrympl carriag which wa seen wait
at a littl distance; she ann and mr clay therefor
turn into molland while mr elliot step to ladi dalrympl
to request her assist he soon join them again success
of course; ladi dalrympl would be most happi to take them home
and would call for them in a few minut

her ladyship carriag wa a barouch and did not hold
more than four with ani comfort miss carteret wa with her mother;
consequ it wa not reason to expect accommod
for all the three camden place ladi there could be no doubt
as to miss elliot whoever suffer inconveni she must suffer none
but it occupi a littl time to settl the point of civil
between the other two the rain wa a mere trifl and ann wa
most sincer in prefer a walk with mr elliot but the rain wa also
a mere trifl to mr clay; she would hardli allow it even to drop at all
and her boot were so thick! much thicker than miss annes;
and in short her civil render her quit as anxiou to be left
to walk with mr elliot as ann could be and it wa discuss between them
with a generos so polit and so determin that the other were
oblig to settl it for them; miss elliot maintain that mr clay
had a littl cold alreadi and mr elliot decid on appeal
that hi cousin ann boot were rather the thickest

it wa fix accordingli that mr clay should be of the parti
in the carriage; and they had just reach thi point when ann
as she sat near the window descri most decidedli and distinctli
captain wentworth walk down the street

her start wa percept onli to herself; but she instantli felt that
she wa the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccount
and absurd! for a few minut she saw noth befor her;
it wa all confus she wa lost and when she had scold
back her sens she found the other still wait for the carriag
and mr elliot (alway obliging) just set off for union street
on a commiss of mr clay

she now felt a great inclin to go to the outer door;
she want to see if it rain whi wa she to suspect herself
of anoth motive? captain wentworth must be out of sight
she left her seat she would go; one half of her should not be alway
so much wiser than the other half or alway suspect the other
of be wors than it wa she would see if it rain
she wa sent back howev in a moment by the entranc of
captain wentworth himself among a parti of gentlemen and ladi
evid hi acquaint and whom he must have join
a littl below milsom street he wa more obvious struck
and confus by the sight of her than she had ever observ before;
he look quit red for the first time sinc their renew acquaint
she felt that she wa betray the least sensibl of the two
she had the advantag of him in the prepar of the last few moment
all the overpow blind bewild first effect
of strong surpris were over with her still howev
she had enough to feel! it wa agit pain pleasur
a someth between delight and miseri

he spoke to her and then turn away the charact of hi manner
wa embarrass she could not have call it either cold or friendli
or anyth so certainli as embarrass

after a short interv howev he came toward her and spoke again
mutual enquiri on common subject passed: neither of them probabl
much the wiser for what they heard and ann continu fulli sensibl
of hi be less at eas than formerli they had by dint of be
so veri much togeth got to speak to each other with a consider
portion of appar indiffer and calmness; but he could not do it now
time had chang him or louisa had chang him there wa conscious
of some sort or other he look veri well not as if he had been
suffer in health or spirit and he talk of uppercross
of the musgrov nay even of louisa and had even a momentari look
of hi own arch signific as he name her; but yet it wa
captain wentworth not comfort not easi not abl to feign that he wa

it did not surpris but it griev ann to observ that elizabeth
would not know him she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him
that there wa complet intern recognit on each side;
she wa convinc that he wa readi to be acknowledg as an acquaint
expect it and she had the pain of see her sister turn away
with unalter cold

ladi dalrympl carriag for which miss elliot wa grow
veri impati now drew up; the servant came in to announc it
it wa begin to rain again and altogeth there wa a delay
and a bustl and a talk which must make all the littl crowd
in the shop understand that ladi dalrympl wa call to convey
miss elliot at last miss elliot and her friend unattend but
by the servant (for there wa no cousin returned) were walk off;
and captain wentworth watch them turn again to ann
and by manner rather than word wa offer hi servic to her

i am much oblig to you wa her answer but i am not go with them
the carriag would not accommod so mani i walk: i prefer walk

but it rain

oh! veri littl noth that i regard

after a moment paus he said: though i came onli yesterday
i have equip myself properli for bath alreadi you see
(point to a new umbrella); i wish you would make use of it
if you are determin to walk; though i think it would be more prudent
to let me get you a chair

she wa veri much oblig to him but declin it all repeat
her convict that the rain would come to noth at present
and ad i am onli wait for mr elliot he will be here in a moment
i am sure

she had hardli spoken the word when mr elliot walk in
captain wentworth recollect him perfectli there wa no differ
between him and the man who had stood on the step at lyme
admir ann as she pass except in the air and look and manner
of the privileg relat and friend he came in with eager
appear to see and think onli of her apologis for hi stay
wa griev to have kept her wait and anxiou to get her away
without further loss of time and befor the rain increased;
and in anoth moment they walk off togeth her arm under hi
a gentl and embarrass glanc and a good morn to you!
be all that she had time for as she pass away

as soon as they were out of sight the ladi of captain wentworth parti
began talk of them

mr elliot doe not dislik hi cousin i fancy?

oh! no that is clear enough one can guess what will happen there
he is alway with them; half live in the famili i believ
what a veri good-look man!

ye and miss atkinson who dine with him onc at the wallis
say he is the most agreeabl man she ever wa in compani with

she is pretti i think; ann elliot; veri pretti when one come
to look at her it is not the fashion to say so but i confess
i admir her more than her sister

oh! so do i

and so do i no comparison but the men are all wild after miss elliot
ann is too delic for them

ann would have been particularli oblig to her cousin if he would have
walk by her side all the way to camden place without say a word
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though noth
could exceed hi solicitud and care and though hi subject
were princip such as were wont to be alway interesting:
prais warm just and discrimin of ladi russel
and insinu highli ration against mr clay but just now
she could think onli of captain wentworth she could not understand
hi present feel whether he were realli suffer much
from disappoint or not; and till that point were settl
she could not be quit herself

she hope to be wise and reason in time; but alas! alas!
she must confess to herself that she wa not wise yet

anoth circumst veri essenti for her to know wa how long
he meant to be in bath; he had not mention it or she could not
recollect it he might be onli pass through but it wa more probabl
that he should be come to stay in that case so liabl as everi bodi wa
to meet everi bodi in bath ladi russel would in all likelihood
see him somewher would she recollect him? how would it all be?

she had alreadi been oblig to tell ladi russel that louisa musgrov
wa to marri captain benwick it had cost her someth to encount
ladi russel surprise; and now if she were by ani chanc
to be thrown into compani with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledg
of the matter might add anoth shade of prejudic against him

the follow morn ann wa out with her friend and for the first hour
in an incess and fear sort of watch for him in vain; but at last
in return down pulteney street she distinguish him
on the right hand pavement at such a distanc as to have him in view
the greater part of the street there were mani other men about him
mani group walk the same way but there wa no mistak him
she look instinct at ladi russell; but not from ani mad idea
of her recognis him so soon as she did herself no it wa
not to be suppos that ladi russel would perceiv him till they
were nearli opposit she look at her howev from time to time
anxiously; and when the moment approach which must point him out
though not dare to look again (for her own counten she knew
wa unfit to be seen) she wa yet perfectli consciou of
ladi russel eye be turn exactli in the direct for him--
of her be in short intent observ him she could thoroughli
comprehend the sort of fascin he must possess over ladi russel mind
the difficulti it must be for her to withdraw her eye the astonish
she must be feel that eight or nine year should have pass over him
and in foreign clime and in activ servic too without rob him
of one person grace!

at last ladi russel drew back her head now how would she
speak of him?

you will wonder said she what ha been fix my eye so long;
but i wa look after some window-curtain which ladi alicia and
mr frankland were tell me of last night they describ
the drawing-room window-curtain of one of the hous on thi
side of the way and thi part of the street as be the handsomest
and best hung of ani in bath but could not recollect the exact number
and i have been tri to find out which it could be; but i confess
i can see no curtain hereabout that answer their descript

ann sigh and blush and smile in piti and disdain
either at her friend or herself the part which provok her most
wa that in all thi wast of foresight and caution she should have
lost the right moment for see whether he saw them

a day or two pass without produc anyth the theatr or the room
where he wa most like to be were not fashion enough
for the elliot whose even amus were sole in the
eleg stupid of privat parti in which they were get
more and more engaged; and ann weari of such a state of stagnat
sick of know noth and fanci herself stronger becaus
her strength wa not tri wa quit impati for the concert even
it wa a concert for the benefit of a person patronis by ladi dalrympl
of cours they must attend it wa realli expect to be a good one
and captain wentworth wa veri fond of music if she could onli have
a few minut convers with him again she fanci she should
be satisfied; and as to the power of address him she felt all over
courag if the opportun occur elizabeth had turn from him
ladi russel overlook him; her nerv were strengthen
by these circumstances; she felt that she owe him attent

she had onc partli promis mr smith to spend the even with her;
but in a short hurri call she excus herself and put it off
with the more decid promis of a longer visit on the morrow
mr smith gave a most good-humour acquiesc

by all mean said she; onli tell me all about it when you do come
who is your party?

ann name them all mr smith made no reply; but when she wa
leav her said and with an express half seriou half arch
well i heartili wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me
to-morrow if you can come; for i begin to have a forebod
that i may not have mani more visit from you

ann wa startl and confused; but after stand in a moment suspens
wa oblig and not sorri to be oblig to hurri away



chapter 20


sir walter hi two daughter and mr clay were the earliest
of all their parti at the room in the evening; and as ladi dalrympl
must be wait for they took their station by one of the fire
in the octagon room but hardli were they so settl when the door
open again and captain wentworth walk in alon ann wa
the nearest to him and make yet a littl advanc she instantli spoke
he wa prepar onli to bow and pass on but her gentl how do you do?
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiri
in return in spite of the formid father and sister in the back ground
their be in the back ground wa a support to anne; she knew noth
of their look and felt equal to everyth which she believ
right to be done

while they were speak a whisper between her father and elizabeth
caught her ear she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject;
and on captain wentworth make a distant bow she comprehend
that her father had judg so well as to give him that
simpl acknowledg of acquaint and she wa just in time
by a side glanc to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself
thi though late and reluct and ungraci wa yet
better than noth and her spirit improv

after talk howev of the weather and bath and the concert
their convers began to flag and so littl wa said at last
that she wa expect him to go everi moment but he did not;
he seem in no hurri to leav her; and present with renew spirit
with a littl smile a littl glow he said--

i have hardli seen you sinc our day at lyme i am afraid you must have
suffer from the shock and the more from it not overpow you
at the time

she assur him that she had not

it wa a fright hour said he a fright day! and he
pass hi hand across hi eye as if the remembr were still
too pain but in a moment half smile again ad
the day ha produc some effect however; ha had some consequ
which must be consid as the veri revers of fright
when you had the presenc of mind to suggest that benwick would be
the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have littl idea
of hi be eventu one of those most concern in her recoveri

certainli i could have none but it appears--i should hope it would be
a veri happi match there are on both side good principl
and good temper

ye said he look not exactli forward; but there i think
end the resembl with all my soul i wish them happi and rejoic
over everi circumst in favour of it they have no difficulti
to contend with at home no opposit no capric no delay
the musgrov are behav like themselv most honour and kindli
onli anxiou with true parent heart to promot their daughter comfort
all thi is much veri much in favour of their happiness;
more than perhaps--

he stop a sudden recollect seem to occur and to give him
some tast of that emot which wa redden ann cheek
and fix her eye on the ground after clear hi throat howev
he proceed thus--

i confess that i do think there is a dispar too great a dispar
and in a point no less essenti than mind i regard louisa musgrov
as a veri amiabl sweet-temp girl and not defici in understand
but benwick is someth more he is a clever man a read man;
and i confess that i do consid hi attach himself to her
with some surpris had it been the effect of gratitud
had he learnt to love her becaus he believ her to be prefer him
it would have been anoth thing but i have no reason to suppos it so
it seem on the contrari to have been a perfectli spontan
untaught feel on hi side and thi surpris me a man like him
in hi situation! with a heart pierc wound almost broken!
fanni harvil wa a veri superior creatur and hi attach to her
wa inde attach a man doe not recov from such
a devot of the heart to such a woman he ought not; he doe not

either from the conscious howev that hi friend had recov
or from other conscious he went no farther; and ann who
in spite of the agit voic in which the latter part had been utter
and in spite of all the variou nois of the room the almost ceaseless
slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of person walk through
had distinguish everi word wa struck gratifi confus
and begin to breath veri quick and feel an hundr thing
in a moment it wa imposs for her to enter on such a subject;
and yet after a paus feel the necess of speak
and have not the smallest wish for a total chang she onli deviat
so far as to say--

you were a good while at lyme i think?

about a fortnight i could not leav it till louisa do well
wa quit ascertain i had been too deepli concern in the mischief
to be soon at peac it had been my do sole mine
she would not have been obstin if i had not been weak
the countri round lyme is veri fine i walk and rode a great deal;
and the more i saw the more i found to admir

i should veri much like to see lyme again said ann

indeed! i should not have suppos that you could have found
anyth in lyme to inspir such a feel the horror and distress
you were involv in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits!
i should have thought your last impress of lyme must have been
strong disgust

the last hour were certainli veri pain repli anne;
but when pain is over the remembr of it often becom a pleasur
one doe not love a place the less for have suffer in it
unless it ha been all suffer noth but suffer which wa
by no mean the case at lyme we were onli in anxieti and distress
dure the last two hour and previous there had been a great deal
of enjoy so much novelti and beauty! i have travel so littl
that everi fresh place would be interest to me; but there is real beauti
at lyme; and in short (with a faint blush at some recollections)
altogeth my impress of the place are veri agreeabl

as she ceas the entranc door open again and the veri parti appear
for whom they were wait ladi dalrympl ladi dalrympl
wa the rejoic sound; and with all the eager compat
with anxiou eleg sir walter and hi two ladi step forward
to meet her ladi dalrympl and miss carteret escort by mr elliot
and colonel walli who had happen to arriv nearli at the same instant
advanc into the room the other join them and it wa
a group in which ann found herself also necessarili includ
she wa divid from captain wentworth their interest
almost too interest convers must be broken up for a time
but slight wa the penanc compar with the happi which brought it on!
she had learnt in the last ten minut more of hi feel
toward louisa more of all hi feel than she dare to think of;
and she gave herself up to the demand of the parti to the need
civil of the moment with exquisit though agit sensat
she wa in good humour with all she had receiv idea which
dispos her to be courteou and kind to all and to piti everi one
as be less happi than herself

the delight emot were a littl subdu when on step back
from the group to be join again by captain wentworth she saw
that he wa gone she wa just in time to see him turn into
the concert room he wa gone; he had disappear she felt
a moment regret but they should meet again he would look for her
he would find her out befor the even were over and at present
perhap it wa as well to be asund she wa in need of
a littl interv for recollect

upon ladi russel appear soon afterward the whole parti
wa collect and all that remain wa to marshal themselv
and proceed into the concert room; and be of all the consequ
in their power draw as mani eye excit as mani whisper
and disturb as mani peopl as they could

veri veri happi were both elizabeth and ann elliot as they walk in
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and look on the broad back
of the dowag viscountess dalrympl befor her had noth to wish for
which did not seem within her reach; and anne--but it would be
an insult to the natur of ann felic to draw ani comparison
between it and her sisters; the origin of one all selfish vaniti
of the other all gener attach

ann saw noth thought noth of the brillianc of the room
her happi wa from within her eye were bright and her cheek glowed;
but she knew noth about it she wa think onli of
the last half hour and as they pass to their seat her mind took
a hasti rang over it hi choic of subject hi express
and still more hi manner and look had been such as she could see
in onli one light hi opinion of louisa musgrov inferior
an opinion which he had seem solicit to give hi wonder
at captain benwick hi feel as to a first strong attachment;
sentenc begun which he could not finish hi half avert eye
and more than half express glanc all all declar that he had
a heart return to her at least; that anger resent avoid
were no more; and that they were succeed not mere by friendship
and regard but by the tender of the past ye some share of
the tender of the past she could not contempl the chang
as impli less he must love her

these were thought with their attend vision which occupi
and flurri her too much to leav her ani power of observation;
and she pass along the room without have a glimps of him
without even tri to discern him when their place were determin on
and they were all properli arrang she look round to see
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he wa not;
her eye could not reach him; and the concert be just open
she must consent for a time to be happi in a humbler way

the parti wa divid and dispos of on two contigu benches:
ann wa among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvr so well
with the assist of hi friend colonel walli as to have a seat by her
miss elliot surround by her cousin and the princip object
of colonel walliss gallantri wa quit content

ann mind wa in a most favour state for the entertain
of the evening; it wa just occup enough: she had feel for
the tender spirit for the gay attent for the scientif
and patienc for the wearisome; and had never like a concert better
at least dure the first act toward the close of it
in the interv succeed an italian song she explain
the word of the song to mr elliot they had a concert bill between them

thi said she is nearli the sens or rather the mean of the word
for certainli the sens of an italian love-song must not be talk of
but it is as nearli the mean as i can give; for i do not pretend
to understand the languag i am a veri poor italian scholar

ye ye i see you are i see you know noth of the matter
you have onli knowledg enough of the languag to translat at sight
these invert transpos curtail italian line into clear
comprehens eleg english you need not say anyth more
of your ignor here is complet proof

i will not oppos such kind politeness; but i should be sorri to be
examin by a real profici

i have not had the pleasur of visit in camden place so long
repli he without know someth of miss ann elliot;
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in gener
to be awar of half her accomplish and too highli accomplish
for modesti to be natur in ani other woman

for shame! for shame! thi is too much flatteri i forget what we are
to have next turn to the bill

perhap said mr elliot speak low i have had a longer acquaint
with your charact than you are awar of

indeed! how so? you can have been acquaint with it onli sinc
i came to bath except as you might hear me previous spoken of
in my own famili

i knew you by report long befor you came to bath i had heard you
describ by those who knew you intim i have been acquaint
with you by charact mani year your person your disposit
accomplish manner; they were all present to me

mr elliot wa not disappoint in the interest he hope to rais
no one can withstand the charm of such a mysteri to have been
describ long ago to a recent acquaint by nameless peopl
is irresistible; and ann wa all curios she wonder
and question him eagerly; but in vain he delight in be ask
but he would not tell

no no some time or other perhap but not now he would mention
no name now; but such he could assur her had been the fact
he had mani year ago receiv such a descript of miss ann elliot
as had inspir him with the highest idea of her merit and excit
the warmest curios to know her

ann could think of no one so like to have spoken with
partial of her mani year ago as the mr wentworth of monkford
captain wentworth brother he might have been in mr elliot compani
but she had not courag to ask the question

the name of ann elliot said he ha long had an interest sound to me
veri long ha it possess a charm over my fancy; and if i dare
i would breath my wish that the name might never chang

such she believ were hi words; but scarc had she
receiv their sound than her attent wa caught by other sound
immedi behind her which render everi thing els trivial
her father and ladi dalrympl were speak

a well-look man said sir walter a veri well-look man

a veri fine young man indeed! said ladi dalrympl more air
than one often see in bath irish i dare say

no i just know hi name a bow acquaint wentworth;
captain wentworth of the navi hi sister marri my tenant
in somersetshir the croft who rent kellynch

befor sir walter had reach thi point ann eye had caught
the right direct and distinguish captain wentworth stand
among a cluster of men at a littl distanc as her eye fell on him
hi seem to be withdrawn from her it had that appear
it seem as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she
dare observ he did not look again: but the perform
wa recommenc and she wa forc to seem to restor her attent
to the orchestra and look straight forward

when she could give anoth glanc he had move away he could not have
come nearer to her if he would; she wa so surround and shut in:
but she would rather have caught hi eye

mr elliot speech too distress her she had no longer
ani inclin to talk to him she wish him not so near her

the first act wa over now she hope for some benefici change;
and after a period of nothing-say amongst the parti some of them
did decid on go in quest of tea ann wa one of the few who
did not choos to move she remain in her seat and so did ladi russell;
but she had the pleasur of get rid of mr elliot; and she did not mean
whatev she might feel on ladi russel account to shrink from
convers with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportun
she wa persuad by ladi russel counten that she had seen him

he did not come howev ann sometim fanci she discern him
at a distanc but he never came the anxiou interv
wore away unproduct the other return the room fill again
bench were reclaim and repossess and anoth hour of pleasur
or of penanc wa to be sat out anoth hour of music wa to give
delight or the gape as real or affect tast for it prevail
to ann it chiefli wore the prospect of an hour of agit
she could not quit that room in peac without see captain wentworth
onc more without the interchang of one friendli look

in re-settl themselv there were now mani chang the result of which
wa favour for her colonel walli declin sit down again
and mr elliot wa invit by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner
not to be refus to sit between them; and by some other remov
and a littl scheme of her own ann wa enabl to place herself
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been befor
much more within reach of a passer-bi she could not do so
without compar herself with miss larol the inimit miss larolles;
but still she did it and not with much happier effect;
though by what seem prosper in the shape of an earli abdic
in her next neighbour she found herself at the veri end of the bench
befor the concert close

such wa her situat with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth
wa again in sight she saw him not far off he saw her too;
yet he look grave and seem irresolut and onli by veri slow degre
came at last near enough to speak to her she felt that someth
must be the matter the chang wa indubit the differ
between hi present air and what it had been in the octagon room
wa strikingli great whi wa it? she thought of her father
of ladi russel could there have been ani unpleas glances?
he began by speak of the concert grave more like the captain
wentworth of uppercross; own himself disappoint had expect singing;
and in short must confess that he should not be sorri when it wa over
ann repli and spoke in defenc of the perform so well
and yet in allow for hi feel so pleasantli that hi counten
improv and he repli again with almost a smile they talk
for a few minut more; the improv held; he even look down
toward the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder oblig ann to turn round
it came from mr elliot he beg her pardon but she must be appli to
to explain italian again miss carteret wa veri anxiou to have
a gener idea of what wa next to be sung ann could not refuse;
but never had she sacrif to polit with a more suffer spirit

a few minut though as few as possibl were inevit consumed;
and when her own mistress again when abl to turn and look
as she had done befor she found herself accost by captain wentworth
in a reserv yet hurri sort of farewel he must wish her good night;
he wa going; he should get home as fast as he could

is not thi song worth stay for? said ann suddenli struck
by an idea which made her yet more anxiou to be encourag

no! he repli impress there is noth worth my stay for;
and he wa gone directli

jealousi of mr elliot! it wa the onli intellig motiv
captain wentworth jealou of her affection! could she have believ it
a week ago; three hour ago! for a moment the gratif wa exquisit
but alas! there were veri differ thought to succeed
how wa such jealousi to be quieted? how wa the truth to reach him?
how in all the peculiar disadvantag of their respect situat
would he ever learn of her real sentiments? it wa miseri to think
of mr elliot attent their evil wa incalcul



chapter 21


ann recollect with pleasur the next morn her promis
of go to mr smith mean that it should engag her from home
at the time when mr elliot would be most like to call; for to avoid
mr elliot wa almost a first object

she felt a great deal of good-wil toward him in spite of
the mischief of hi attent she owe him gratitud and regard
perhap compass she could not help think much of the extraordinari
circumst attend their acquaint of the right which
he seem to have to interest her by everyth in situat
by hi own sentiment by hi earli prepossess it wa altogeth
veri extraordinary; flatter but pain there wa much to regret
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case
wa not worth enquiry; for there wa a captain wentworth;
and be the conclus of the present suspens good or bad
her affect would be hi for ever their union she believ
could not divid her more from other men than their final separ

prettier muse of high-wrought love and etern constanc
could never have pass along the street of bath than ann
wa sport with from camden place to westgat build
it wa almost enough to spread purif and perfum all the way

she wa sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seem thi morn
particularli oblig to her for come seem hardli to have expect her
though it had been an appoint

an account of the concert wa immedi claimed; and ann recollect
of the concert were quit happi enough to anim her featur
and make her rejoic to talk of it all that she could tell
she told most gladli but the all wa littl for one who had been there
and unsatisfactori for such an enquir as mr smith who had
alreadi heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter
rather more of the gener success and produc of the even
than ann could relat and who now ask in vain for sever particular
of the compani everybodi of ani consequ or notorieti in bath
wa well know by name to mr smith

the littl durand were there i conclud said she with their mouth
open to catch the music like unfledg sparrow readi to be fed
they never miss a concert

yes; i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were
in the room

the ibbotson were they there? and the two new beauti
with the tall irish offic who is talk of for one of them

i do not know i do not think they were

old ladi mari maclean? i need not ask after her she never miss
i know; and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle;
for as you went with ladi dalrympl you were in the seat of grandeur
round the orchestra of cours

no that wa what i dread it would have been veri unpleas to me
in everi respect but happili ladi dalrympl alway choos
to be farther off; and we were exceedingli well place that is
for hearing; i must not say for see becaus i appear to have seen
veri littl

oh! you saw enough for your own amus i can understand
there is a sort of domest enjoy to be known even in a crowd
and thi you had you were a larg parti in yourselv
and you want noth beyond

but i ought to have look about me more said ann consciou
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of look about
that the object onli had been defici

no no; you were better employ you need not tell me that you
had a pleasant even i see it in your eye i perfectli see
how the hour passed: that you had alway someth agreeabl
to listen to in the interv of the concert it wa convers

ann half smile and said do you see that in my eye?

ye i do your counten perfectli inform me that you were
in compani last night with the person whom you think the most agreeabl
in the world the person who interest you at thi present time
more than all the rest of the world put togeth

a blush overspread ann cheek she could say noth

and such be the case continu mr smith after a short paus
i hope you believ that i do know how to valu your kind
in come to me thi morn it is realli veri good of you
to come and sit with me when you must have so mani pleasant demand
upon your time

ann heard noth of thi she wa still in the astonish and
confus excit by her friend penetr unabl to imagin
how ani report of captain wentworth could have reach her
after anoth short silence--

pray said mr smith is mr elliot awar of your acquaint with me?
doe he know that i am in bath?

mr elliot! repeat ann look up surpris a moment reflect
shew her the mistak she had been under she caught it instantaneously;
and recov her courag with the feel of safeti soon ad
more composedli are you acquaint with mr elliot?

i have been a good deal acquaint with him repli mr smith grave
but it seem worn out now it is a great while sinc we met

i wa not at all awar of thi you never mention it befor
had i known it i would have had the pleasur of talk to him about you

to confess the truth said mr smith assum her usual
air of cheer that is exactli the pleasur i want you to have
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him
he can be of essenti servic to me; and if you would have the good
my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself
of cours it is done

i should be extrem happy; i hope you cannot doubt my willing
to be of even the slightest use to you repli anne; but i suspect
that you are consid me as have a higher claim on mr elliot
a greater right to influenc him than is realli the case
i am sure you have somehow or other imbib such a notion
you must consid me onli as mr elliot relat if in that light
there is anyth which you suppos hi cousin might fairli ask of him
i beg you would not hesit to employ me

mr smith gave her a penetr glanc and then smile said--

i have been a littl prematur i perceive; i beg your pardon
i ought to have wait for offici inform but now my dear
miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak
next week? to be sure by next week i may be allow to
think it all settl and build my own selfish scheme on
mr elliot good fortun

no repli ann nor next week nor next nor next
i assur you that noth of the sort you are think of
will be settl ani week i am not go to marri mr elliot
i should like to know whi you imagin i am?

mr smith look at her again look earnestli smile
shook her head and exclaimed--

now how i do wish i understood you! how i do wish i knew
what you were at! i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel
when the right moment occur till it doe come you know
we women never mean to have anybodi it is a thing of cours among us
that everi man is refus till he offer but whi should you be cruel?
let me plead for my--pres friend i cannot call him but for
my former friend where can you look for a more suitabl match?
where could you expect a more gentlemanlik agreeabl man?
let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear noth but good of him
from colonel wallis; and who can know him better than colonel wallis?

my dear mr smith mr elliot wife ha not been dead much abov
half a year he ought not to be suppos to be pay hi address
to ani one

oh! if these are your onli object cri mr smith archli
mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more troubl about him
do not forget me when you are marri that all let him know me to be
a friend of your and then he will think littl of the troubl requir
which it is veri natur for him now with so mani affair and engag
of hi own to avoid and get rid of as he can; veri natur perhap
ninety-nin out of a hundr would do the same of cours
he cannot be awar of the import to me well my dear miss elliot
i hope and trust you will be veri happi mr elliot ha sens
to understand the valu of such a woman your peac will not be
shipwreck as mine ha been you are safe in all worldli matter
and safe in hi charact he will not be led astray; he will not be
misl by other to hi ruin

no said ann i can readili believ all that of my cousin
he seem to have a calm decid temper not at all open
to danger impress i consid him with great respect
i have no reason from ani thing that ha fallen within my observ
to do otherwis but i have not known him long; and he is not a man
i think to be known intim soon will not thi manner
of speak of him mr smith convinc you that he is noth to me?
sure thi must be calm enough and upon my word he is noth to me
should he ever propos to me (which i have veri littl reason to imagin
he ha ani thought of doing) i shall not accept him i assur you
i shall not i assur you mr elliot had not the share which
you have been suppos in whatev pleasur the concert
of last night might afford: not mr elliot; it is not mr elliot that--

she stop regret with a deep blush that she had impli so much;
but less would hardli have been suffici mr smith would hardli
have believ so soon in mr elliot failur but from the percept
of there be a somebodi els as it wa she instantli submit
and with all the semblanc of see noth beyond; and ann
eager to escap farther notic wa impati to know whi mr smith
should have fanci she wa to marri mr elliot; where she could have
receiv the idea or from whom she could have heard it

do tell me how it first came into your head

it first came into my head repli mr smith upon find how much
you were togeth and feel it to be the most probabl thing
in the world to be wish for by everybodi belong to either of you;
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaint have dispos of you
in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two day ago

and ha it inde been spoken of?

did you observ the woman who open the door to you when
you call yesterday?

no wa not it mr speed as usual or the maid? i observ
no one in particular

it wa my friend mr rooke; nurs rooke; who by-the-by
had a great curios to see you and wa delight to be in the way
to let you in she came away from marlborough build onli on sunday;
and she it wa who told me you were to marri mr elliot
she had had it from mr walli herself which did not seem bad author
she sat an hour with me on monday even and gave me the whole histori
the whole histori repeat ann laugh she could not make
a veri long histori i think of one such littl articl
of unfound news

mr smith said noth

but continu ann present though there is no truth in my have
thi claim on mr elliot i should be extrem happi to be of use to you
in ani way that i could shall i mention to him your be in bath?
shall i take ani message?

no i thank you: no certainli not in the warmth of the moment
and under a mistaken impress i might perhap have endeavour
to interest you in some circumstances; but not now no i thank you
i have noth to troubl you with

i think you spoke of have known mr elliot mani years?

i did

not befor he wa marri i suppose?

yes; he wa not marri when i knew him first

and--wer you much acquainted?

intim

indeed! then do tell me what he wa at that time of life
i have a great curios to know what mr elliot wa as a veri young man
wa he at all such as he appear now?

i have not seen mr elliot these three year wa mr smith answer
given so grave that it wa imposs to pursu the subject farther;
and ann felt that she had gain noth but an increas of curios
they were both silent: mr smith veri thought at last--

i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cri in her
natur tone of cordial i beg your pardon for the short answer
i have been give you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do
i have been doubt and consid as to what i ought to tell you
there were mani thing to be taken into the account one hate
to be offici to be give bad impress make mischief
even the smooth surfac of family-union seem worth preserv
though there may be noth durabl beneath howev i have determined;
i think i am right; i think you ought to be made acquaint
with mr elliot real charact though i fulli believ that
at present you have not the smallest intent of accept him
there is no say what may happen you might some time or other
be differ affect toward him hear the truth therefor
now while you are unprejud mr elliot is a man without heart
or conscience; a design wari cold-blood be who think
onli of himself; whom for hi own interest or eas would be guilti
of ani cruelti or ani treacheri that could be perpetr without
risk of hi gener charact he ha no feel for other
those whom he ha been the chief caus of lead into ruin
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunct
he is total beyond the reach of ani sentiment of justic or compass
oh! he is black at heart hollow and black!

ann astonish air and exclam of wonder made her paus
and in a calmer manner she ad

my express startl you you must allow for an injur angri woman
but i will tri to command myself i will not abus him
i will onli tell you what i have found him fact shall speak
he wa the intim friend of my dear husband who trust and love him
and thought him as good as himself the intimaci had been form
befor our marriag i found them most intim friends; and i too
becam excess pleas with mr elliot and entertain
the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one doe not
think veri seriously; but mr elliot appear to me quit as good as other
and much more agreeabl than most other and we were almost
alway togeth we were princip in town live in veri good style
he wa then the inferior in circumstances; he wa then the poor one;
he had chamber in the templ and it wa as much as he could do
to support the appear of a gentleman he had alway a home
with us whenev he chose it; he wa alway welcome; he wa like a brother
my poor charl who had the finest most gener spirit in the world
would have divid hi last farth with him; and i know that hi purs
wa open to him; i know that he often assist him

thi must have been about that veri period of mr elliot life
said ann which ha alway excit my particular curios
it must have been about the same time that he becam known to
my father and sister i never knew him myself; i onli heard of him;
but there wa a someth in hi conduct then with regard to
my father and sister and afterward in the circumst of hi marriag
which i never could quit reconcil with present time it seem
to announc a differ sort of man

i know it all i know it all cri mr smith he had been
introduc to sir walter and your sister befor i wa acquaint with him
but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he wa invit
and encourag and i know he did not choos to go i can satisfi you
perhap on point which you would littl expect; and as to hi marriag
i knew all about it at the time i wa privi to all the for and againsts;
i wa the friend to whom he confid hi hope and plans; and though
i did not know hi wife previous her inferior situat in societi
inde render that imposs yet i knew her all her life afterward
or at least till within the last two year of her life and can answer
ani question you may wish to put

nay said ann i have no particular enquiri to make about her
i have alway understood they were not a happi coupl but i should
like to know whi at that time of hi life he should slight
my father acquaint as he did my father wa certainli dispos
to take veri kind and proper notic of him whi did mr elliot draw back?

mr elliot repli mr smith at that period of hi life
had one object in view: to make hi fortun and by a rather quicker
process than the law he wa determin to make it by marriag
he wa determin at least not to mar it by an imprud marriage;
and i know it wa hi belief (whether justli or not of cours
i cannot decide) that your father and sister in their civil
and invit were design a match between the heir
and the young ladi and it wa imposs that such a match
should have answer hi idea of wealth and independ
that wa hi motiv for draw back i can assur you
he told me the whole stori he had no conceal with me
it wa curiou that have just left you behind me in bath
my first and princip acquaint on marri should be your cousin;
and that through him i should be continu hear of your father
and sister he describ one miss elliot and i thought
veri affection of the other

perhap cri ann struck by a sudden idea you sometim
spoke of me to mr elliot?

to be sure i did; veri often i use to boast of my own ann elliot
and vouch for your be a veri differ creatur from--

she check herself just in time

thi account for someth which mr elliot said last night
cri ann thi explain it i found he had been use to hear of me
i could not comprehend how what wild imagin one form where
dear self is concerned! how sure to be mistaken! but i beg your pardon;
i have interrupt you mr elliot marri then complet for money?
the circumst probabl which first open your eye
to hi charact

mr smith hesit a littl here oh! those thing are too common
when one live in the world a man or woman marri for money
is too common to strike one as it ought i wa veri young
and associ onli with the young and we were a thoughtless
gay set without ani strict rule of conduct we live for enjoy
i think differ now; time and sick and sorrow have given me
other notions; but at that period i must own i saw noth reprehens
in what mr elliot wa do `to do the best for himself
pass as a duti

but wa not she a veri low woman?

yes; which i object to but he would not regard money money
wa all that he want her father wa a grazier her grandfath
had been a butcher but that wa all noth she wa a fine woman
had had a decent educ wa brought forward by some cousin
thrown by chanc into mr elliot compani and fell in love with him;
and not a difficulti or a scrupl wa there on hi side
with respect to her birth all hi caution wa spent in be secur
of the real amount of her fortun befor he commit himself
depend upon it whatev esteem mr elliot may have for hi own situat
in life now as a young man he had not the smallest valu for it
hi chanc for the kellynch estat wa someth but all the honour
of the famili he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declar
that if baronetci were saleabl anybodi should have hi
for fifti pound arm and motto name and liveri included;
but i will not pretend to repeat half that i use to hear him say
on that subject it would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof
for what is all thi but assert and you shall have proof

inde my dear mr smith i want none cri ann you have assert
noth contradictori to what mr elliot appear to be some year ago
thi is all in confirm rather of what we use to hear and believ
i am more curiou to know whi he should be so differ now

but for my satisfact if you will have the good to ring for mary;
stay: i am sure you will have the still greater good of
go yourself into my bedroom and bring me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet

ann see her friend to be earnestli bent on it did as she wa desir
the box wa brought and place befor her and mr smith sigh over it
as she unlock it said--

thi is full of paper belong to him to my husband;
a small portion onli of what i had to look over when i lost him
the letter i am look for wa one written by mr elliot to him
befor our marriag and happen to be saved; whi one can hardli imagin
but he wa careless and immethod like other men about those things;
and when i came to examin hi paper i found it with other
still more trivial from differ peopl scatter here and there
while mani letter and memorandum of real import had been destroy
here it is; i would not burn it becaus be even then veri littl
satisfi with mr elliot i wa determin to preserv everi document
of former intimaci i have now anoth motiv for be glad
that i can produc it

thi wa the letter direct to charl smith esq tunbridg well
and date from london as far back as juli 1803: --

dear smith--i have receiv your your kind almost overpow me
i wish natur had made such heart as your more common but i have
live three-and-twenti year in the world and have seen none like it
at present believ me i have no need of your servic
be in cash again give me joy: i have got rid of sir walter and miss
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them
thi summer; but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor
to tell me how to bring it with best advantag to the hammer
the baronet nevertheless is not unlik to marri again;
he is quit fool enough if he doe howev they will leav me in peac
which may be a decent equival for the revers he is wors
than last year

i wish i had ani name but elliot i am sick of it the name of walter
i can drop thank god! and i desir you will never insult me
with my second w again mean for the rest of my life
to be onli your truly--wm elliot

such a letter could not be read without put ann in a glow;
and mr smith observ the high colour in her face said--

the languag i know is highli disrespect though i have forgot
the exact term i have a perfect impress of the gener mean
but it show you the man mark hi profess to my poor husband
can ani thing be stronger?

ann could not immedi get over the shock and mortif
of find such word appli to her father she wa oblig to recollect
that her see the letter wa a violat of the law of honour
that no one ought to be judg or to be known by such testimoni
that no privat correspond could bear the eye of other
befor she could recov calm enough to return the letter
which she had been medit over and say--

thank you thi is full proof undoubtedly; proof of everi thing
you were say but whi be acquaint with us now?

i can explain thi too cri mr smith smile

can you really?

ye i have shewn you mr elliot as he wa a dozen year ago
and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produc written proof again
but i can give as authent oral testimoni as you can desir of what
he is now want and what he is now do he is no hypocrit now
he truli want to marri you hi present attent to your famili
are veri sincere: quit from the heart i will give you my authority:
hi friend colonel walli

colonel wallis! you are acquaint with him?

no it doe not come to me in quit so direct a line as that;
it take a bend or two but noth of consequ the stream
is as good as at first; the littl rubbish it collect in the turn
is easili move away mr elliot talk unreservedli to colonel walli
of hi view on you which said colonel walli i imagin to be
in himself a sensibl care discern sort of character;
but colonel walli ha a veri pretti silli wife to whom
he tell thing which he had better not and he repeat it all to her
she in the overflow spirit of her recoveri repeat it all
to her nurse; and the nurs know my acquaint with you
veri natur bring it all to me on monday even my good friend
mr rook let me thu much into the secret of marlborough build
when i talk of a whole histori therefor you see i wa
not romanc so much as you suppos

my dear mr smith your author is defici thi will not do
mr elliot have ani view on me will not in the least account
for the effort he made toward a reconcili with my father
that wa all prior to my come to bath i found them on
the most friendli term when i arriv

i know you did; i know it all perfectli but--

inde mr smith we must not expect to get real inform
in such a line fact or opinion which are to pass through the hand
of so mani to be misconceiv by folli in one and ignor in anoth
can hardli have much truth left

onli give me a hear you will soon be abl to judg of
the gener credit due by listen to some particular
which you can yourself immedi contradict or confirm
nobodi suppos that you were hi first induc he had seen you
inde befor he came to bath and admir you but without
know it to be you so say my historian at least is thi true?
did he see you last summer or autumn `somewher down in the west
to use her own word without know it to be you?

he certainli did so far it is veri true at lyme
i happen to be at lyme

well continu mr smith triumphantli grant my friend the credit
due to the establish of the first point assert he saw you then
at lyme and like you so well as to be exceedingli pleas
to meet with you again in camden place as miss ann elliot
and from that moment i have no doubt had a doubl motiv
in hi visit there but there wa anoth and an earlier
which i will now explain if there is anyth in my stori which you know
to be either fals or improb stop me my account state
that your sister friend the ladi now stay with you
whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter
as long ago as septemb (in short when they first came themselves)
and ha been stay there ever since; that she is a clever insinu
handsom woman poor and plausibl and altogeth such in situat
and manner as to give a gener idea among sir walter acquaint
of her mean to be ladi elliot and as gener a surpris
that miss elliot should be appar blind to the danger

here mr smith paus a moment; but ann had not a word to say
and she continued--

thi wa the light in which it appear to those who knew the famili
long befor you return to it; and colonel walli had hi eye
upon your father enough to be sensibl of it though he did not then
visit in camden place; but hi regard for mr elliot gave him an interest
in watch all that wa go on there and when mr elliot came to bath
for a day or two as he happen to do a littl befor christma
colonel walli made him acquaint with the appear of thing
and the report begin to prevail now you are to understand
that time had work a veri materi chang in mr elliot opinion
as to the valu of a baronetci upon all point of blood and connexion
he is a complet alter man have long had as much money
as he could spend noth to wish for on the side of avaric
or indulg he ha been gradual learn to pin hi happi
upon the consequ he is heir to i thought it come on
befor our acquaint ceas but it is now a confirm feel
he cannot bear the idea of not be sir william you may guess
therefor that the news he heard from hi friend could not be
veri agreeabl and you may guess what it produced; the resolut
of come back to bath as soon as possibl and of fix himself here
for a time with the view of renew hi former acquaint
and recov such a foot in the famili as might give him the mean
of ascertain the degre of hi danger and of circumv the ladi
if he found it materi thi wa agre upon between the two friend
as the onli thing to be done; and colonel walli wa to assist
in everi way that he could he wa to be introduc and mr walli
wa to be introduc and everybodi wa to be introduc
mr elliot came back accordingly; and on applic wa forgiven
as you know and re-admit into the family; and there it wa
hi constant object and hi onli object (till your arriv
ad anoth motive) to watch sir walter and mr clay
he omit no opportun of be with them threw himself in their way
call at all hours; but i need not be particular on thi subject
you can imagin what an art man would do; and with thi guid
perhap may recollect what you have seen him do

ye said ann you tell me noth which doe not accord with
what i have known or could imagin there is alway someth offens
in the detail of cun the manoeuvr of selfish and duplic
must ever be revolt but i have heard noth which realli surpris me
i know those who would be shock by such a represent of mr elliot
who would have difficulti in believ it; but i have never been satisfi
i have alway want some other motiv for hi conduct than appear
i should like to know hi present opinion as to the probabl
of the event he ha been in dread of; whether he consid the danger
to be lessen or not

lessen i understand repli mr smith he think mr clay
afraid of him awar that he see through her and not dare to proceed
as she might do in hi absenc but sinc he must be absent
some time or other i do not perceiv how he can ever be secur
while she hold her present influenc mr walli ha an amus idea
as nurs tell me that it is to be put into the marriag articl
when you and mr elliot marri that your father is not to marri mr clay
a scheme worthi of mr walliss understand by all accounts;
but my sensibl nurs rook see the absurd of it `whi to be sure
maam said she `it would not prevent hi marri anybodi els
and inde to own the truth i do not think nurs in her heart
is a veri strenuou oppos of sir walter make a second match
she must be allow to be a favour of matrimoni you know;
and (sinc self will intrude) who can say that she may not have
some fli vision of attend the next ladi elliot through
mr walliss recommendation?

i am veri glad to know all thi said ann after a littl
thought it will be more pain to me in some respect
to be in compani with him but i shall know better what to do
my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evid
a disingenu artifici worldli man who ha never had
ani better principl to guid him than selfish

but mr elliot wa not done with mr smith had been carri away
from her first direct and ann had forgotten in the interest
of her own famili concern how much had been origin impli
against him; but her attent wa now call to the explan
of those first hint and she listen to a recit which
if it did not perfectli justifi the unqualifi bitter of mr smith
prove him to have been veri unfeel in hi conduct toward her;
veri defici both in justic and compass

she learn that (the intimaci between them continu unimpair
by mr elliot marriage) they had been as befor alway togeth
and mr elliot had led hi friend into expens much beyond hi fortun
mr smith did not want to take blame to herself and wa most tender
of throw ani on her husband; but ann could collect that their incom
had never been equal to their style of live and that from the first
there had been a great deal of gener and joint extravag
from hi wife account of him she could discern mr smith to have been
a man of warm feel easi temper careless habit and not strong
understand much more amiabl than hi friend and veri unlik him
led by him and probabl despis by him mr elliot rais by
hi marriag to great affluenc and dispos to everi gratif
of pleasur and vaniti which could be command without involv himself
(for with all hi self-indulg he had becom a prudent man)
and begin to be rich just as hi friend ought to have found himself
to be poor seem to have had no concern at all for that friend
probabl financ but on the contrari had been prompt and
encourag expens which could end onli in ruin; and the smith
accordingli had been ruin

the husband had die just in time to be spare the full knowledg of it
they had previous known embarrass enough to tri the friendship
of their friend and to prove that mr elliot had better not be tried;
but it wa not till hi death that the wretch state of hi affair
wa fulli known with a confid in mr elliot regard
more credit to hi feel than hi judgement mr smith had
appoint him the executor of hi will; but mr elliot would not act
and the difficulti and distress which thi refus had heap on her
in addit to the inevit suffer of her situat had been such
as could not be relat without anguish of spirit or listen to
without correspond indign

ann wa shewn some letter of hi on the occas answer to
urgent applic from mr smith which all breath the same
stern resolut of not engag in a fruitless troubl and
under a cold civil the same hard-heart indiffer
to ani of the evil it might bring on her it wa a dread pictur
of ingratitud and inhumanity; and ann felt at some moment
that no flagrant open crime could have been wors she had a great deal
to listen to; all the particular of past sad scene all the minutia
of distress upon distress which in former convers had been
mere hint at were dwelt on now with a natur indulg
ann could perfectli comprehend the exquisit relief and wa onli
the more inclin to wonder at the composur of her friend
usual state of mind

there wa one circumst in the histori of her grievanc
of particular irrit she had good reason to believ that
some properti of her husband in the west indi which had been
for mani year under a sort of sequestr for the payment
of it own incumbr might be recover by proper measures;
and thi properti though not larg would be enough to make
her compar rich but there wa nobodi to stir in it
mr elliot would do noth and she could do noth herself
equal disabl from person exert by her state of
bodili weak and from employ other by her want of money
she had no natur connexion to assist her even with their counsel
and she could not afford to purchas the assist of the law
thi wa a cruel aggrav of actual straiten mean
to feel that she ought to be in better circumst
that a littl troubl in the right place might do it
and to fear that delay might be even weaken her claim
wa hard to bear

it wa on thi point that she had hope to engag ann good offic
with mr elliot she had previous in the anticip
of their marriag been veri apprehens of lose her friend by it;
but on be assur that he could have made no attempt of that natur
sinc he did not even know her to be in bath it immedi occur
that someth might be done in her favour by the influenc of the woman
he love and she had been hastili prepar to interest ann feel
as far as the observ due to mr elliot charact would allow
when ann refut of the suppos engag chang
the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-form hope
of succeed in the object of her first anxieti left her at least
the comfort of tell the whole stori her own way

after listen to thi full descript of mr elliot ann could not but
express some surpris at mr smith have spoken of him so favour
in the begin of their convers she had seem to recommend
and prais him!

my dear wa mr smith repli there wa noth els to be done
i consid your marri him as certain though he might not yet
have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him
than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you
as i talk of happiness; and yet he is sensibl he is agreeabl
and with such a woman as you it wa not absolut hopeless
he wa veri unkind to hi first wife they were wretch togeth
but she wa too ignor and giddi for respect and he had never love her
i wa will to hope that you must fare better

ann could just acknowledg within herself such a possibl
of have been induc to marri him as made her shudder at the idea
of the miseri which must have follow it wa just possibl that
she might have been persuad by ladi russell! and under such
a supposit which would have been most miser when time had
disclos all too late?

it wa veri desir that ladi russel should be no longer deceived;
and one of the conclud arrang of thi import confer
which carri them through the greater part of the morn
wa that ann had full liberti to commun to her friend
everyth rel to mr smith in which hi conduct wa involv



chapter 22


ann went home to think over all that she had heard in one point
her feel were reliev by thi knowledg of mr elliot
there wa no longer anyth of tender due to him he stood as
oppos to captain wentworth in all hi own unwelcom obtrusiveness;
and the evil of hi attent last night the irremedi mischief
he might have done wa consid with sensat unqualifi unperplex
piti for him wa all over but thi wa the onli point of relief
in everi other respect in look around her or penetr forward
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend she wa concern
for the disappoint and pain ladi russel would be feeling;
for the mortif which must be hang over her father and sister
and had all the distress of forese mani evil without know
how to avert ani one of them she wa most thank for her own
knowledg of him she had never consid herself as entitl to reward
for not slight an old friend like mr smith but here wa
a reward inde spring from it! mr smith had been abl to tell her
what no one els could have done could the knowledg have
been extend through her family? but thi wa a vain idea
she must talk to ladi russel tell her consult with her
and have done her best wait the event with as much composur
as possible; and after all her greatest want of composur would be
in that quarter of the mind which could not be open to ladi russell;
in that flow of anxieti and fear which must be all to herself


she found on reach home that she had as she intend
escap see mr elliot; that he had call and paid them
a long morn visit; but hardli had she congratul herself
and felt safe when she heard that he wa come again in the even

i had not the smallest intent of ask him said elizabeth
with affect careless but he gave so mani hints;
so mr clay say at least

inde i do say it i never saw anybodi in my life spell harder
for an invit poor man! i wa realli in pain for him;
for your hard-heart sister miss ann seem bent on cruelti

oh! cri elizabeth i have been rather too much use to the game
to be soon overcom by a gentleman hint howev when i found
how excess he wa regret that he should miss my father
thi morn i gave way immedi for i would never realli omit
an opportun of bring him and sir walter togeth they appear to
so much advantag in compani with each other each behav so pleasantli
mr elliot look up with so much respect

quit delightful! cri mr clay not dare howev
to turn her eye toward ann exactli like father and son!
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son?

oh! i lay no embargo on ani bodi word if you will have such
ideas! but upon my word i am scarc sensibl of hi attent
be beyond those of other men

my dear miss elliot! exclaim mr clay lift her hand and eye
and sink all the rest of her astonish in a conveni silenc

well my dear penelop you need not be so alarm about him
i did invit him you know i sent him away with smile
when i found he wa realli go to hi friend at thornberri park
for the whole day to-morrow i had compass on him

ann admir the good act of the friend in be abl to shew
such pleasur as she did in the expect and in the actual arriv
of the veri person whose presenc must realli be interf with
her prime object it wa imposs but that mr clay must hate
the sight of mr elliot; and yet she could assum a most oblig
placid look and appear quit satisfi with the curtail licens
of devot herself onli half as much to sir walter as she would have
done otherwis

to ann herself it wa most distress to see mr elliot enter the room;
and quit pain to have him approach and speak to her
she had been use befor to feel that he could not be alway quit sincer
but now she saw insincer in everyth hi attent defer
to her father contrast with hi former languag wa odious;
and when she thought of hi cruel conduct toward mr smith
she could hardli bear the sight of hi present smile and mild
or the sound of hi artifici good sentiment

she meant to avoid ani such alter of manner as might provok
a remonstr on hi side it wa a great object to her to escap
all enquiri or eclat; but it wa her intent to be as decidedli cool
to him as might be compat with their relationship; and to retrac
as quietli as she could the few step of unnecessari intimaci she had
been gradual led along she wa accordingli more guard
and more cool than she had been the night befor

he want to anim her curios again as to how and where
he could have heard her formerli praised; want veri much
to be gratifi by more solicitation; but the charm wa broken:
he found that the heat and anim of a public room wa necessari
to kindl hi modest cousin vanity; he found at least that it wa
not to be done now by ani of those attempt which he could hazard
among the too-command claim of the other he littl surmis
that it wa a subject act now exactli against hi interest
bring immedi to her thought all those part of hi conduct
which were least excus

she had some satisfact in find that he wa realli go out of bath
the next morn go earli and that he would be gone the greater part
of two day he wa invit again to camden place the veri even of
hi return; but from thursday to saturday even hi absenc wa certain
it wa bad enough that a mr clay should be alway befor her;
but that a deeper hypocrit should be ad to their parti
seem the destruct of everyth like peac and comfort
it wa so humili to reflect on the constant decept practis
on her father and elizabeth; to consid the variou sourc
of mortif prepar for them! mr clay selfish wa
not so complic nor so revolt as his; and ann would have compound
for the marriag at onc with all it evil to be clear of mr elliot
subtleti in endeavour to prevent it

on friday morn she meant to go veri earli to ladi russel
and accomplish the necessari communication; and she would have gone
directli after breakfast but that mr clay wa also go out
on some oblig purpos of save her sister troubl which
determin her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion
she saw mr clay fairli off therefor befor she began to talk
of spend the morn in river street

veri well said elizabeth i have noth to send but my love
oh! you may as well take back that tiresom book she would lend me
and pretend i have read it through i realli cannot be plagu myself
for ever with all the new poem and state of the nation that come out
ladi russel quit bore one with her new public
you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideou the other night
i use to think she had some tast in dress but i wa asham of her
at the concert someth so formal and arrang in her air!
and she sit so upright! my best love of cours

and mine ad sir walter kindest regard and you may say
that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message;
but i shall onli leav my card morn visit are never fair
by women at her time of life who make themselv up so littl
if she would onli wear roug she would not be afraid of be seen;
but last time i call i observ the blind were let down immedi

while her father spoke there wa a knock at the door who could it be?
ann rememb the preconcert visit at all hour of mr elliot
would have expect him but for hi known engag seven mile off
after the usual period of suspens the usual sound of approach were heard
and mr and mr charl musgrov were usher into the room

surpris wa the strongest emot rais by their appearance;
but ann wa realli glad to see them; and the other were not so sorri
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon
as it becam clear that these their nearest relat were not arriv
with an view of accommod in that hous sir walter and elizabeth
were abl to rise in cordial and do the honour of it veri well
they were come to bath for a few day with mr musgrov and were
at the white hart so much wa pretti soon understood;
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walk mari into
the other drawing-room and regal themselv with her admir
ann could not draw upon charless brain for a regular histori
of their come or an explan of some smile hint
of particular busi which had been ostentati drop by mari
as well as of some appar confus as to whom their parti consist of

she then found that it consist of mr musgrov henrietta
and captain harvil besid their two selv he gave her a veri plain
intellig account of the whole; a narrat in which she saw
a great deal of most characterist proceed the scheme
had receiv it first impuls by captain harvil want to
come to bath on busi he had begun to talk of it a week ago;
and by way of do someth as shoot wa over charl had propos
come with him and mr harvil had seem to like the idea of it
veri much as an advantag to her husband; but mari could not bear
to be left and had made herself so unhappi about it that for a day or two
everyth seem to be in suspens or at an end but then
it had been taken up by hi father and mother hi mother had
some old friend in bath whom she want to see; it wa thought
a good opportun for henrietta to come and buy wedding-cloth
for herself and her sister; and in short it end in be
hi mother parti that everyth might be comfort and easi
to captain harville; and he and mari were includ in it
by way of gener conveni they had arriv late the night befor
mr harvil her children and captain benwick remain with
mr musgrov and louisa at uppercross

ann onli surpris wa that affair should be in forward enough
for henrietta wedding-cloth to be talk of she had imagin
such difficulti of fortun to exist there as must prevent
the marriag from be near at hand; but she learn from charl that
veri recent (sinc mari last letter to herself) charl hayter
had been appli to by a friend to hold a live for a youth
who could not possibl claim it under mani years; and that
on the strength of hi present incom with almost a certainti
of someth more perman long befor the term in question
the two famili had consent to the young peopl wish
and that their marriag wa like to take place in a few month
quit as soon as louisa and a veri good live it wa
charl added: onli five-and-twenti mile from uppercross
and in a veri fine country: fine part of dorsetshir
in the centr of some of the best preserv in the kingdom
surround by three great proprietor each more care and jealou
than the other; and to two of the three at least charl hayter might get
a special recommend not that he will valu it as he ought
he observ charl is too cool about sport that the worst of him

i am extrem glad inde cri ann particularli glad
that thi should happen; and that of two sister who both deserv
equal well and who have alway been such good friend
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dim those of the other--
that they should be so equal in their prosper and comfort
i hope your father and mother are quit happi with regard to both

oh! ye my father would be well pleas if the gentlemen were richer
but he ha no other fault to find money you know come down with
money--two daughter at once--it cannot be a veri agreeabl oper
and it streighten him as to mani thing howev i do not mean to say
they have not a right to it it is veri fit they should have
daughter shares; and i am sure he ha alway been a veri kind
liber father to me mari doe not abov half like henrietta match
she never did you know but she doe not do him justic
nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to
the valu of the properti it is a veri fair match as time go;
and i have like charl hayter all my life and i shall not leav off now

such excel parent as mr and mr musgrov exclaim ann
should be happi in their children marriag they do everyth
to confer happi i am sure what a bless to young peopl
to be in such hands! your father and mother seem so total free
from all those ambiti feel which have led to so much misconduct
and miseri both in young and old i hope you think louisa
perfectli recov now?

he answer rather hesitatingli ye i believ i do; veri much recovered;
but she is altered; there is no run or jump about no laugh
or dancing; it is quit differ if one happen onli to shut the door
a littl hard she start and wriggl like a young dab-chick in the water;
and benwick sit at her elbow read vers or whisper to her
all day long

ann could not help laugh that cannot be much to your tast
i know said she; but i do believ him to be an excel young man

to be sure he is nobodi doubt it; and i hope you do not think
i am so illiber as to want everi man to have the same object and
pleasur as myself i have a great valu for benwick; and when one can
but get him to talk he ha plenti to say hi read ha done him
no harm for he ha fought as well as read he is a brave fellow
i got more acquaint with him last monday than ever i did befor
we had a famou set-to at rat-hunt all the morn in
my father great barns; and he play hi part so well
that i have like him the better ever sinc

here they were interrupt by the absolut necess of charless
follow the other to admir mirror and china; but ann had
heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross
and rejoic in it happiness; and though she sigh as she rejoic
her sigh had none of the ill-wil of envi in it she would certainli
have risen to their bless if she could but she did not want
to lessen their

the visit pass off altogeth in high good humour mari wa
in excel spirit enjoy the gaieti and the chang
and so well satisfi with the journey in her mother-in-law carriag
with four hors and with her own complet independ of camden place
that she wa exactli in a temper to admir everyth as she ought
and enter most readili into all the superior of the hous
as they were detail to her she had no demand on her father or sister
and her consequ wa just enough increas by their handsom
drawing-room

elizabeth wa for a short time suffer a good deal
she felt that mr musgrov and all her parti ought to be ask
to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the differ of style
the reduct of servant which a dinner must betray wit by those
who had been alway so inferior to the elliot of kellynch
it wa a struggl between proprieti and vanity; but vaniti got the better
and then elizabeth wa happi again these were her intern persuasions:
old fashion notions; countri hospitality; we do not profess
to give dinners; few peopl in bath do; ladi alicia never does;
did not even ask her own sister famili though they were here a month:
and i dare say it would be veri inconveni to mr musgrove;
put her quit out of her way i am sure she would rather not come;
she cannot feel easi with us i will ask them all for an evening;
that will be much better; that will be a novelti and a treat
they have not seen two such draw room befor they will be delight
to come to-morrow even it shall be a regular parti small
but most eleg and thi satisfi elizabeth: and when the invit
wa given to the two present and promis for the absent
mari wa as complet satisfi she wa particularli ask
to meet mr elliot and be introduc to ladi dalrympl and miss carteret
who were fortun alreadi engag to come; and she could not
have receiv a more gratifi attent miss elliot wa to have
the honour of call on mr musgrov in the cours of the morning;
and ann walk off with charl and mari to go and see her
and henrietta directli

her plan of sit with ladi russel must give way for the present
they all three call in river street for a coupl of minutes;
but ann convinc herself that a day delay of the intend commun
could be of no consequ and hasten forward to the white hart
to see again the friend and companion of the last autumn
with an eager of good-wil which mani associ contribut to form

they found mr musgrov and her daughter within and by themselv
and ann had the kindest welcom from each henrietta wa exactli
in that state of recently-improv view of fresh-form happi
which made her full of regard and interest for everybodi she had
ever like befor at all; and mr musgrov real affect had been won
by her use when they were in distress it wa a hearti
and a warmth and a sincer which ann delight in the more
from the sad want of such bless at home she wa entreat
to give them as much of her time as possibl invit for everi day
and all day long or rather claim as part of the family; and in return
she natur fell into all her wont way of attent and assist
and on charless leav them togeth wa listen to mr musgrov
histori of louisa and to henrietta of herself give opinion
on busi and recommend to shops; with interv of everi help
which mari requir from alter her ribbon to settl her accounts;
from find her key and assort her trinket to tri
to convinc her that she wa not ill-us by anybody; which mari
well amus as she gener wa in her station at a window
overlook the entranc to the pump room could not but have
her moment of imagin

a morn of thorough confus wa to be expect a larg parti
in an hotel ensur a quick-chang unsettl scene one five minut
brought a note the next a parcel; and ann had not been there
half an hour when their dining-room spaciou as it wa
seem more than half filled: a parti of steadi old friend
were seat around mr musgrov and charl came back with
captain harvil and wentworth the appear of the latter
could not be more than the surpris of the moment it wa imposs
for her to have forgotten to feel that thi arriv of their
common friend must be soon bring them togeth again
their last meet had been most import in open hi feelings;
she had deriv from it a delight conviction; but she fear
from hi look that the same unfortun persuas which had
hasten him away from the concert room still govern
he did not seem to want to be near enough for convers

she tri to be calm and leav thing to take their cours
and tri to dwell much on thi argument of ration dependence:--
sure if there be constant attach on each side our heart
must understand each other ere long we are not boy and girl
to be captious irrit misl by everi moment inadvert
and wantonli play with our own happi and yet
a few minut afterward she felt as if their be in compani
with each other under their present circumst could onli be
expos them to inadvert and misconstruct of the most
mischiev kind

ann cri mari still at her window there is mr clay
i am sure stand under the colonnad and a gentleman with her
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seem
deep in talk who is it? come and tell me good heavens! i recollect
it is mr elliot himself

no cri ann quickli it cannot be mr elliot i assur you
he wa to leav bath at nine thi morn and doe not come back
till to-morrow

as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth wa look at her
the conscious of which vex and embarrass her and made her regret
that she had said so much simpl as it wa

mari resent that she should be suppos not to know her own cousin
began talk veri warmli about the famili featur and protest
still more posit that it wa mr elliot call again upon ann
to come and look for herself but ann did not mean to stir
and tri to be cool and unconcern her distress return
howev on perceiv smile and intellig glanc pass between
two or three of the ladi visitor as if they believ themselv
quit in the secret it wa evid that the report concern her
had spread and a short paus succeed which seem to ensur
that it would now spread farther

do come ann cri mari come and look yourself you will be too late
if you do not make hast they are parting; they are shake hand
he is turn away not know mr elliot indeed! you seem to have
forgot all about lyme

to pacifi mari and perhap screen her own embarrass
ann did move quietli to the window she wa just in time to ascertain
that it realli wa mr elliot which she had never believ
befor he disappear on one side as mr clay walk quickli off
on the other; and check the surpris which she could not but feel
at such an appear of friendli confer between two person
of total opposit interest she calmli said ye it is mr elliot
certainli he ha chang hi hour of go i suppos that is all
or i may be mistaken i might not attend; and walk back to her chair
recompos and with the comfort hope of have acquit herself well

the visitor took their leave; and charl have civilli seen them off
and then made a face at them and abus them for come began with--

well mother i have done someth for you that you will like

mr musgrov wa good humouredli begin to express her perfect readi
for the play if henrietta and all the other like it when mari
eagerli interrupt her by exclaiming--

good heaven charles! how can you think of such a thing?
take a box for to-morrow night! have you forgot that we are engag
to camden place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularli ask
to meet ladi dalrympl and her daughter and mr elliot and all
the princip famili connexion on purpos to be introduc to them?
how can you be so forgetful?

phoo! phoo! repli charl what an even party?
never worth rememb your father might have ask us to dinner
i think if he had want to see us you may do as you like
but i shall go to the play

oh! charl i declar it will be too abomin if you do

no i did not promis i onli smirk and bow and said the word
`happi there wa no promis

but you must go charl it would be unpardon to fail

such a great connexion between the dalrympl and ourselv
noth ever happen on either side that wa not announc immedi
we are quit near relat you know; and mr elliot too
whom you ought so particularli to be acquaint with! everi attent
is due to mr elliot consid my father heir: the futur
repres of the famili

dont talk to me about heir and repres cri charl
i am not one of those who neglect the reign power to bow
to the rise sun if i would not go for the sake of your father
i should think it scandal to go for the sake of hi heir
what is mr elliot to me? the careless express wa life to ann
who saw that captain wentworth wa all attent look and
listen with hi whole soul; and that the last word brought
hi enquir eye from charl to herself

charl and mari still talk on in the same style; he half seriou
and half jest maintain the scheme for the play and she
invari seriou most warmli oppos it and not omit
to make it known that howev determin to go to camden place herself
she should not think herself veri well use if they went to the play
without her mr musgrov interpos

we had better put it off charl you had much better go back
and chang the box for tuesday it would be a piti to be divid
and we should be lose miss ann too if there is a parti at her fathers;
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play
if miss ann could not be with us

ann felt truli oblig to her for such kindness; and quit as much
so for the opportun it gave her of decidedli saying--

if it depend onli on my inclin maam the parti at home
(except on mari account) would not be the smallest impedi
i have no pleasur in the sort of meet and should be too happi
to chang it for a play and with you but it had better
not be attempt perhap she had spoken it; but she trembl
when it wa done consciou that her word were listen to
and dare not even to tri to observ their effect

it wa soon gener agre that tuesday should be the day;
charl onli reserv the advantag of still teas hi wife
by persist that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobodi els would

captain wentworth left hi seat and walk to the fire-place;
probabl for the sake of walk away from it soon afterward
and take a station with less bare-fac design by ann

you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy
the even parti of the place

oh! no the usual charact of them ha noth for me
i am no card-play

you were not formerli i know you did not use to like cards;
but time make mani chang

i am not yet so much chang cri ann and stop fear she
hardli knew what misconstruct after wait a few moment
he said and as if it were the result of immedi feel
it is a period indeed! eight year and a half is a period

whether he would have proceed farther wa left to ann imagin
to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hear the sound
he had utter she wa startl to other subject by henrietta
eager to make use of the present leisur for get out
and call on her companion to lose no time lest somebodi els
should come in

they were oblig to move ann talk of be perfectli readi
and tri to look it; but she felt that could henrietta have known
the regret and reluct of her heart in quit that chair
in prepar to quit the room she would have found in all her own
sensat for her cousin in the veri secur of hi affect
wherewith to piti her

their prepar howev were stop short alarm sound
were heard; other visitor approach and the door wa thrown open
for sir walter and miss elliot whose entranc seem to give
a gener chill ann felt an instant oppress and wherev she look
saw symptom of the same the comfort the freedom the gaieti
of the room wa over hush into cold composur determin silenc
or insipid talk to meet the heartless eleg of her father and sister
how mortifi to feel that it wa so!

her jealou eye wa satisfi in one particular captain wentworth
wa acknowledg again by each by elizabeth more gracious than befor
she even address him onc and look at him more than onc
elizabeth wa in fact revolv a great measur the sequel
explain it after the wast of a few minut in say
the proper noth she began to give the invit which
wa to compris all the remain due of the musgrov
to-morrow even to meet a few friends: no formal parti
it wa all said veri grace and the card with which she had
provid herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the tabl
with a courteou comprehens smile to all and one smile and
one card more decidedli for captain wentworth the truth wa
that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand
the import of a man of such an air and appear as hi
the past wa noth the present wa that captain wentworth
would move about well in her drawing-room the card wa pointedli given
and sir walter and elizabeth aros and disappear

the interrupt had been short though sever and eas and anim
return to most of those they left as the door shut them out
but not to ann she could think onli of the invit she had
with such astonish wit and of the manner in which
it had been received; a manner of doubt mean of surpris rather
than gratif of polit acknowledg rather than accept
she knew him; she saw disdain in hi eye and could not ventur to believ
that he had determin to accept such an offer as an aton
for all the insol of the past her spirit sank he held the card
in hi hand after they were gone as if deepli consid it

onli think of elizabeth includ everybody! whisper mari
veri audibl i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted!
you see he cannot put the card out of hi hand

ann caught hi eye saw hi cheek glow and hi mouth form itself
into a momentari express of contempt and turn away
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her

the parti separ the gentlemen had their own pursuit
the ladi proceed on their own busi and they met no more while
ann belong to them she wa earnestli beg to return and dine
and give them all the rest of the day but her spirit had been
so long exert that at present she felt unequ to more
and fit onli for home where she might be sure of be as silent
as she chose

promis to be with them the whole of the follow morn therefor
she close the fatigu of the present by a toilsom walk to camden place
there to spend the even chiefli in listen to the busi arrang
of elizabeth and mr clay for the morrow parti the frequent enumer
of the person invit and the continu improv detail of all
the embellish which were to make it the most complet eleg
of it kind in bath while harass herself with the never-end
question of whether captain wentworth would come or not? they were
reckon him as certain but with her it wa a gnaw solicitud
never appeas for five minut togeth she gener thought
he would come becaus she gener thought he ought; but it wa a case
which she could not so shape into ani posit act of duti or discret
as inevit to defi the suggest of veri opposit feel

she onli rous herself from the brood of thi restless agit
to let mr clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot
three hour after hi be suppos to be out of bath
for have watch in vain for some intim of the interview
from the ladi herself she determin to mention it and it seem to her
there wa guilt in mr clay face as she listen it wa transient:
clear away in an instant; but ann could imagin she read there
the conscious of have by some complic of mutual trick
or some overbear author of hi been oblig to attend
(perhap for half an hour) to hi lectur and restrict on her design
on sir walter she exclaim howev with a veri toler
imit of nature: --

oh! dear! veri true onli think miss elliot to my great surpris
i met with mr elliot in bath street i wa never more astonish
he turn back and walk with me to the pump yard he had been prevent
set off for thornberri but i realli forget by what;
for i wa in a hurri and could not much attend and i can onli answer
for hi be determin not to be delay in hi return
he want to know how earli he might be admit to-morrow
he wa full of `to-morrow and it is veri evid that i have been
full of it too ever sinc i enter the hous and learnt the extens
of your plan and all that had happen or my see him could never have
gone so entir out of my head



chapter 23


one day onli had pass sinc ann convers with mr smith;
but a keener interest had succeed and she wa now so littl touch
by mr elliot conduct except by it effect in one quarter
that it becam a matter of cours the next morn still to defer
her explanatori visit in river street she had promis to be
with the musgrov from breakfast to dinner her faith wa plight
and mr elliot charact like the sulta scheherazad head
must live anoth day

she could not keep her appoint punctual however;
the weather wa unfavour and she had griev over the rain
on her friend account and felt it veri much on her own
befor she wa abl to attempt the walk when she reach the white hart
and made her way to the proper apart she found herself
neither arriv quit in time nor the first to arriv
the parti befor her were mr musgrov talk to mr croft
and captain harvil to captain wentworth; and she immedi heard
that mari and henrietta too impati to wait had gone out the moment
it had clear but would be back again soon and that the strictest
injunct had been left with mr musgrov to keep her there
till they return she had onli to submit sit down
be outwardli compos and feel herself plung at onc
in all the agit which she had mere laid her account of
tast a littl befor the morn close there wa no delay
no wast of time she wa deep in the happi of such miseri
or the miseri of such happi instantli two minut after
her enter the room captain wentworth said--

we will write the letter we were talk of harvil now
if you will give me materi

materi were at hand on a separ table; he went to it
and nearli turn hi back to them all wa engross by write

mr musgrov wa give mr croft the histori of her eldest
daughter engag and just in that inconveni tone of voic
which wa perfectli audibl while it pretend to be a whisper
ann felt that she did not belong to the convers and yet
as captain harvil seem thought and not dispos to talk
she could not avoid hear mani undesir particulars; such as
how mr musgrov and my brother hayter had met again and again
to talk it over; what my brother hayter had said one day
and what mr musgrov had propos the next and what had occur
to my sister hayter and what the young peopl had wish and what
i said at first i never could consent to but wa afterward persuad
to think might do veri well and a great deal in the same style
of open-heart communication: minutia which even with everi advantag
of tast and delicaci which good mr musgrov could not give
could be properli interest onli to the princip mr croft
wa attend with great good-humour and whenev she spoke at all
it wa veri sensibl ann hope the gentlemen might each be
too much self-occupi to hear

and so maam all these thing consid said mr musgrov
in her power whisper though we could have wish it differ
yet altogeth we did not think it fair to stand out ani longer
for charl hayter wa quit wild about it and henrietta wa
pretti near as bad; and so we thought they had better marri at onc
and make the best of it as mani other have done befor them
at ani rate said i it will be better than a long engag

that is precis what i wa go to observ cri mr croft
i would rather have young peopl settl on a small incom at onc
and have to struggl with a few difficulti togeth than be
involv in a long engag i alway think that no mutual--

oh! dear mr croft cri mr musgrov unabl to let her
finish her speech there is noth i so abomin for young peopl
as a long engag it is what i alway protest against
for my children it is all veri well i use to say for young peopl
to be engag if there is a certainti of their be abl to marri
in six month or even in twelve; but a long engagement--

ye dear maam said mr croft or an uncertain engag
an engag which may be long to begin without know
that at such a time there will be the mean of marri
i hold to be veri unsaf and unwis and what i think all parent
should prevent as far as they can

ann found an unexpect interest here she felt it applic
to herself felt it in a nervou thrill all over her; and at the same
moment that her eye instinct glanc toward the distant tabl
captain wentworth pen ceas to move hi head wa rais paus
listen and he turn round the next instant to give a look
one quick consciou look at her

the two ladi continu to talk to re-urg the same admit truth
and enforc them with such exampl of the ill effect of
a contrari practic as had fallen within their observ
but ann heard noth distinctly; it wa onli a buzz of word in her ear
her mind wa in confus

captain harvil who had in truth been hear none of it
now left hi seat and move to a window and ann seem to watch him
though it wa from thorough absenc of mind becam gradual sensibl
that he wa invit her to join him where he stood he look at her
with a smile and a littl motion of the head which express
come to me i have someth to say; and the unaffect
easi kind of manner which denot the feel of an older acquaint
than he realli wa strongli enforc the invit she rous herself
and went to him the window at which he stood wa at the other end
of the room from where the two ladi were sit and though nearer
to captain wentworth tabl not veri near as she join him
captain harvil counten re-assum the seriou thought
express which seem it natur charact

look here said he unfold a parcel in hi hand and display
a small miniatur paint do you know who that is?

certainly: captain benwick

ye and you may guess who it is for but (in a deep tone)
it wa not done for her miss elliot do you rememb our
walk togeth at lyme and griev for him? i littl thought then--
but no matter thi wa drawn at the cape he met with
a clever young german artist at the cape and in complianc with a promis
to my poor sister sat to him and wa bring it home for her;
and i have now the charg of get it properli set for another!
it wa a commiss to me! but who els wa there to employ?
i hope i can allow for him i am not sorri inde to make it
over to anoth he undertak it; (look toward captain wentworth)
he is write about it now and with a quiver lip he wound up
the whole by ad poor fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!

no repli ann in a low feel voic that i can easili believ

it wa not in her natur she dote on him

it would not be the natur of ani woman who truli love

captain harvil smile as much as to say do you claim that
for your sex? and she answer the question smile also
ye we certainli do not forget you as soon as you forget us
it is perhap our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselv
we live at home quiet confin and our feel prey upon us
you are forc on exert you have alway a profess pursuit
busi of some sort or other to take you back into the world immedi
and continu occup and chang soon weaken impress

grant your assert that the world doe all thi so soon for men
(which howev i do not think i shall grant) it doe not appli
to benwick he ha not been forc upon ani exert the peac
turn him on shore at the veri moment and he ha been live with us
in our littl famili circl ever sinc

true said ann veri true; i did not recollect; but what shall
we say now captain harville? if the chang be not from
outward circumst it must be from within; it must be natur
man natur which ha done the busi for captain benwick

no no it is not man natur i will not allow it to be more
man natur than woman to be inconst and forget those they do love
or have love i believ the revers i believ in a true analog
between our bodili frame and our mental; and that as our bodi are
the strongest so are our feelings; capabl of bear most rough usag
and ride out the heaviest weather

your feel may be the strongest repli ann but the same spirit
of analog will authoris me to assert that our are the most tender
man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived;
which exactli explain my view of the natur of their attach
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwis
you have difficulti and privat and danger enough to struggl with
you are alway labour and toil expos to everi risk and hardship
your home countri friend all quit neither time nor health
nor life to be call your own it would be hard inde
(with a falter voice) if woman feel were to be
ad to all thi

we shall never agre upon thi question captain harvil
wa begin to say when a slight nois call their attent
to captain wentworth hitherto perfectli quiet divis of the room
it wa noth more than that hi pen had fallen down; but ann wa
startl at find him nearer than she had suppos and half inclin
to suspect that the pen had onli fallen becaus he had been
occupi by them strive to catch sound which yet she did not think
he could have caught

have you finish your letter? said captain harvil

not quit a few line more i shall have done in five minut

there is no hurri on my side i am onli readi whenev you are
i am in veri good anchorag here (smile at anne) well suppli
and want for noth no hurri for a signal at all well miss elliot
(lower hi voice) as i wa say we shall never agre
i suppos upon thi point no man and woman would probabl
but let me observ that all histori are against you--al stori
prose and vers if i had such a memori as benwick i could bring you
fifti quotat in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think
i ever open a book in my life which had not someth to say
upon woman inconst song and proverb all talk
of woman fickl but perhap you will say these were all
written by men

perhap i shall ye ye if you pleas no refer to exampl
in book men have had everi advantag of us in tell their own stori
educ ha been their in so much higher a degree; the pen ha
been in their hand i will not allow book to prove anyth

but how shall we prove anything?

we never shall we never can expect to prove ani thing upon such a point
it is a differ of opinion which doe not admit of proof
we each begin probabl with a littl bia toward our own sex;
and upon that bia build everi circumst in favour of it
which ha occur within our own circle; mani of which circumst
(perhap those veri case which strike us the most) may be precis such
as cannot be brought forward without betray a confid
or in some respect say what should not be said

ah! cri captain harvil in a tone of strong feel
if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffer when he take
a last look at hi wife and children and watch the boat
that he ha sent them off in as long as it is in sight
and then turn away and say `god know whether we ever meet again!
and then if i could convey to you the glow of hi soul when he doe
see them again; when come back after a twelvemonth absenc
perhap and oblig to put into anoth port he calcul how soon
it be possibl to get them there pretend to deceiv himself
and say `they cannot be here till such a day but all the while
hope for them twelv hour sooner and see them arriv at last
as if heaven had given them wing by mani hour sooner still!
if i could explain to you all thi and all that a man can bear and do
and glori to do for the sake of these treasur of hi existence!
i speak you know onli of such men as have hearts! press hi own
with emot

oh! cri ann eagerli i hope i do justic to all that is felt by you
and by those who resembl you god forbid that i should undervalu
the warm and faith feel of ani of my fellow-creatures!
i should deserv utter contempt if i dare to suppos that true attach
and constanc were known onli by woman no i believ you capabl
of everyth great and good in your marri live i believ you equal
to everi import exert and to everi domest forbear
so long as--if i may be allow the expression--so long as you have
an object i mean while the woman you love live and live for you
all the privileg i claim for my own sex (it is not a veri enviabl one;
you need not covet it) is that of love longest when exist
or when hope is gone

she could not immedi have utter anoth sentence; her heart
wa too full her breath too much oppress

you are a good soul cri captain harvil put hi hand
on her arm quit affection there is no quarrel with you
and when i think of benwick my tongu is tie

their attent wa call toward the other mr croft wa take leav

here frederick you and i part compani i believ said she
i am go home and you have an engag with your friend
to-night we may have the pleasur of all meet again at your parti
(turn to anne) we had your sister card yesterday
and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it;
and you are disengag frederick are you not as well as ourselves?

captain wentworth wa fold up a letter in great hast and either
could not or would not answer fulli

ye said he veri true; here we separ but harvil and i
shall soon be after you; that is harvil if you are readi
i am in half a minut i know you will not be sorri to be off
i shall be at your servic in half a minut

mr croft left them and captain wentworth have seal hi letter
with great rapid wa inde readi and had even a hurri
agit air which shew impati to be gone ann knew not how
to understand it she had the kindest good morn god bless you!
from captain harvil but from him not a word nor a look!
he had pass out of the room without a look!

she had onli time howev to move closer to the tabl where
he had been write when footstep were heard returning;
the door open it wa himself he beg their pardon
but he had forgotten hi glove and instantli cross the room
to the write tabl he drew out a letter from under the scatter paper
place it befor ann with eye of glow entreati fix on her
for a time and hastili collect hi glove wa again out of the room
almost befor mr musgrov wa awar of hi be in it:
the work of an instant!

the revolut which one instant had made in ann wa almost
beyond express the letter with a direct hardli legibl
to miss a e-- wa evid the one which he had been fold
so hastili while suppos to be write onli to captain benwick
he had been also address her! on the content of that letter
depend all which thi world could do for her anyth wa possibl
anyth might be defi rather than suspens mr musgrov had
littl arrang of her own at her own table; to their protect
she must trust and sink into the chair which he had occupi
succeed to the veri spot where he had lean and written
her eye devour the follow words:


i can listen no longer in silenc i must speak to you by such mean
as are within my reach you pierc my soul i am half agoni
half hope tell me not that i am too late that such preciou feel
are gone for ever i offer myself to you again with a heart
even more your own than when you almost broke it eight year
and a half ago dare not say that man forget sooner than woman
that hi love ha an earlier death i have love none but you
unjust i may have been weak and resent i have been
but never inconst you alon have brought me to bath
for you alon i think and plan have you not seen this?
can you fail to have understood my wishes? i had not wait even
these ten day could i have read your feel as i think you must have
penetr mine i can hardli write i am everi instant hear
someth which overpow me you sink your voic but i can
distinguish the tone of that voic when they would be lost on other
too good too excel creature! you do us justic inde
you do believ that there is true attach and constanc among men
believ it to be most fervent most undevi in f w

i must go uncertain of my fate; but i shall return hither
or follow your parti as soon as possibl a word a look
will be enough to decid whether i enter your father hous
thi even or never


such a letter wa not to be soon recov from half and hour solitud
and reflect might have tranquil her; but the ten minut onli
which now pass befor she wa interrupt with all the restraint
of her situat could do noth toward tranquil everi moment
rather brought fresh agit it wa overpow happi
and befor she wa beyond the first stage of full sensat
charl mari and henrietta all came in

the absolut necess of seem like herself produc then
an immedi struggle; but after a while she could do no more
she began not to understand a word they said and wa oblig
to plead indisposit and excus herself they could then see
that she look veri ill were shock and concern and would not
stir without her for the world thi wa dread would they onli
have gone away and left her in the quiet possess of that room
it would have been her cure; but to have them all stand or
wait around her wa distract and in desper
she said she would go home

by all mean my dear cri mr musgrov go home directli
and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the even
i wish sarah wa here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself
charl ring and order a chair she must not walk

but the chair would never do wors than all! to lose the possibl
of speak two word to captain wentworth in the cours of her quiet
solitari progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meet him)
could not be born the chair wa earnestli protest against
and mr musgrov who thought onli of one sort of ill
have assur herself with some anxieti that there had been no fall
in the case; that ann had not at ani time late slip down
and got a blow on her head; that she wa perfectli convinc of have
had no fall; could part with her cheer and depend on
find her better at night

anxiou to omit no possibl precaut ann struggl and said--

i am afraid maam that it is not perfectli understood
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope
to see your whole parti thi even i am afraid there had been
some mistake; and i wish you particularli to assur captain harvil
and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both

oh! my dear it is quit understood i give you my word
captain harvil ha no thought but of go

do you think so? but i am afraid; and i should be so veri sorri
will you promis me to mention it when you see them again?
you will see them both thi morn i dare say do promis me

to be sure i will if you wish it charl if you see captain harvil
anywher rememb to give miss ann messag but inde my dear
you need not be uneasi captain harvil hold himself quit engag
ill answer for it; and captain wentworth the same i dare say

ann could do no more; but her heart prophesi some mischanc
to damp the perfect of her felic it could not be veri last
howev even if he did not come to camden place himself
it would be in her power to send an intellig sentenc
by captain harvil anoth momentari vexat occur
charl in hi real concern and good natur would go home with her;
there wa no prevent him thi wa almost cruel but she could not
be long ungrateful; he wa sacrif an engag at a gunsmith
to be of use to her; and she set off with him with no feel
but gratitud appar

they were on union street when a quicker step behind a someth
of familiar sound gave her two moment prepar for the sight
of captain wentworth he join them; but as if irresolut
whether to join or to pass on said noth onli look
ann could command herself enough to receiv that look
and not repuls the cheek which had been pale now glow
and the movement which had hesit were decid he walk by her side
present struck by a sudden thought charl said--

captain wentworth which way are you going? onli to gay street
or farther up the town?

i hardli know repli captain wentworth surpris

are you go as high as belmont? are you go near camden place?
becaus if you are i shall have no scrupl in ask you
to take my place and give ann your arm to her father door
she is rather done for thi morn and must not go so far without help
and i ought to be at that fellow in the market place
he promis me the sight of a capit gun he is just go to send off;
said he would keep it unpack to the last possibl moment
that i might see it; and if i do not turn back now i have no chanc
by hi descript a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine
which you shot with one day round winthrop

there could not be an object there could be onli the most
proper alacr a most oblig complianc for public view;
and smile rein in and spirit danc in privat raptur
in half a minut charl wa at the bottom of union street again
and the other two proceed together: and soon word enough had pass
between them to decid their direct toward the compar quiet
and retir gravel walk where the power of convers would make
the present hour a bless inde and prepar it for all
the immort which the happiest recollect of their own futur live
could bestow there they exchang again those feel
and those promis which had onc befor seem to secur everyth
but which had been follow by so mani mani year of divis
and estrang there they return again into the past
more exquisit happi perhap in their re-union than when
it had been first projected; more tender more tri more fix
in a knowledg of each other charact truth and attachment;
more equal to act more justifi in act and there as they slowli
pace the gradual ascent heedless of everi group around them
see neither saunter politician bustl housekeep
flirt girl nor nursery-maid and children they could indulg in
those retrospect and acknowledg and especi in
those explan of what had directli preced the present moment
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest all the littl
variat of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday
and today there could scarc be an end

she had not mistaken him jealousi of mr elliot had been
the retard weight the doubt the torment that had begun to oper
in the veri hour of first meet her in bath; that had return
after a short suspens to ruin the concert; and that had influenc him
in everyth he had said and done or omit to say and do
in the last four-and-twenti hour it had been gradual yield
to the better hope which her look or word or action
occasion encouraged; it had been vanquish at last by
those sentiment and those tone which had reach him while she talk
with captain harville; and under the irresist govern of which
he had seiz a sheet of paper and pour out hi feel

of what he had then written noth wa to be retract or qualifi
he persist in have love none but her she had never been supplant
he never even believ himself to see her equal thu much inde
he wa oblig to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsci
nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her and believ it
to be done he had imagin himself indiffer when he had onli
been angry; and he had been unjust to her merit becaus he had been
a suffer from them her charact wa now fix on hi mind
as perfect itself maintain the loveliest medium of fortitud
and gentleness; but he wa oblig to acknowledg that onli at uppercross
had he learnt to do her justic and onli at lyme had he begun
to understand himself at lyme he had receiv lesson
of more than one sort the pass admir of mr elliot
had at least rous him and the scene on the cobb and at
captain harvil had fix her superior

in hi preced attempt to attach himself to louisa musgrov
(the attempt of angri pride) he protest that he had for ever
felt it to be impossible; that he had not care could not care
for louisa; though till that day till the leisur for reflect
which follow it he had not understood the perfect excel
of the mind with which louisa could so ill bear a comparison
or the perfect unrival hold it possess over hi own
there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadi of principl
and the obstinaci of self-wil between the dare of heedless
and the resolut of a collect mind there he had seen everyth
to exalt in hi estim the woman he had lost; and there begun
to deplor the pride the folli the mad of resent
which had kept him from tri to regain her when thrown in hi way

from that period hi penanc had becom sever he had no sooner
been free from the horror and remors attend the first few day
of louisa accid no sooner begun to feel himself aliv again
than he had begun to feel himself though aliv not at liberti

i found said he that i wa consid by harvil an engag man!
that neither harvil nor hi wife entertain a doubt of our
mutual attach i wa startl and shock to a degre
i could contradict thi instantly; but when i began to reflect
that other might have felt the same--h own famili nay
perhap herself--i wa no longer at my own dispos i wa her in honour
if she wish it i had been unguard i had not thought serious
on thi subject befor i had not consid that my excess intimaci
must have it danger of ill consequ in mani ways; and that i had
no right to be tri whether i could attach myself to either of the girl

and that precis as he becam fulli satisfi of hi not care

i wa six week with edward said he and saw him happi
i could have no other pleasur i deserv none he enquir after you
veri particularly; ask even if you were person alter
littl suspect that to my eye you could never alter

ann smile and let it pass it wa too pleas a blunder
for a reproach it is someth for a woman to be assur
in her eight-and-twentieth year that she ha not lost one charm
of earlier youth; but the valu of such homag wa inexpress increas
to ann by compar it with former word and feel it to be
the result not the caus of a reviv of hi warm attach

and the blunder of hi own calcul till at onc releas from louisa
by the astonish and felicit intellig of her engag
with benwick

here said he end the worst of my state; for now i could at least
put myself in the way of happiness; i could exert myself;
i could do someth but to be wait so long in inact
and wait onli for evil had been dread within the first
five minut i said `i will be at bath on wednesday and i wa
wa it unpardon to think it worth my while to come? and to arriv
with some degre of hope? you were singl it wa possibl that
you might retain the feel of the past as i did; and one encourag
happen to be mine i could never doubt that you would be love and
sought by other but i knew to a certainti that you had refus one man
at least of better pretens than myself; and i could not help
often say `wa thi for me?

their first meet in milsom street afford much to be said
but the concert still more that even seem to be made up
of exquisit moment the moment of her step forward
in the octagon room to speak to him: the moment of mr elliot appear
and tear her away and one or two subsequ moment
mark by return hope or increas despond were dwelt on
with energi

to see you cri he in the midst of those who could not be
my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you convers and smile
and feel all the horribl elig and proprieti of the match!
to consid it as the certain wish of everi be who could hope
to influenc you! even if your own feel were reluct or indiffer
to consid what power support would be his! wa it not enough
to make the fool of me which i appeared? how could i look on
without agony? wa not the veri sight of the friend who sat behind you
wa not the recollect of what had been the knowledg of her influenc
the indel immov impress of what persuas had onc done--
wa it not all against me?

you should have distinguish repli ann you should not have
suspect me now; the case is so differ and my age is so differ
if i wa wrong in yield to persuas onc rememb that
it wa to persuas exert on the side of safeti not of risk
when i yield i thought it wa to duti but no duti could be call
in aid here in marri a man indiffer to me all risk
would have been incur and all duti violat

perhap i ought to have reason thu he repli but i could not
i could not deriv benefit from the late knowledg i had acquir
of your charact i could not bring it into play; it wa overwhelm
buri lost in those earlier feel which i had been smart under
year after year i could think of you onli as one who had yield
who had given me up who had been influenc by ani one rather than by me
i saw you with the veri person who had guid you in that year of miseri
i had no reason to believ her of less author now the forc of habit
wa to be ad

i should have thought said ann that my manner to yourself
might have spare you much or all of thi

no no! your manner might be onli the eas which your engag
to anoth man would give i left you in thi belief; and yet
i wa determin to see you again my spirit ralli with the morn
and i felt that i had still a motiv for remain here

at last ann wa at home again and happier than ani one in that hous
could have conceiv all the surpris and suspens and everi other
pain part of the morn dissip by thi convers
she re-ent the hous so happi as to be oblig to find an alloy
in some momentari apprehens of it be imposs to last
an interv of medit seriou and grate wa the best correct
of everyth danger in such high-wrought felicity; and she went
to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thank
of her enjoy

the even came the drawing-room were light up the compani assembl
it wa but a card parti it wa but a mixtur of those who had
never met befor and those who met too often; a commonplac busi
too numer for intimaci too small for variety; but ann had never found
an even shorter glow and love in sensibl and happi
and more gener admir than she thought about or care for
she had cheer or forbear feel for everi creatur around her
mr elliot wa there; she avoid but she could piti him
the wallis she had amus in understand them ladi dalrympl
and miss carteret--they would soon be innoxi cousin to her
she care not for mr clay and had noth to blush for in
the public manner of her father and sister with the musgrov
there wa the happi chat of perfect ease; with captain harvil
the kind-heart intercours of brother and sister; with ladi russel
attempt at convers which a delici conscious cut short;
with admir and mr croft everyth of peculiar cordial and
fervent interest which the same conscious sought to conceal;
and with captain wentworth some moment of commun
continu occur and alway the hope of more and alway
the knowledg of hi be there

it wa in one of these short meet each appar occupi
in admir a fine display of greenhous plant that she said--

i have been think over the past and tri imparti
to judg of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself;
and i must believ that i wa right much as i suffer from it
that i wa perfectli right in be guid by the friend whom
you will love better than you do now to me she wa in the place
of a parent do not mistak me howev i am not say
that she did not err in her advic it wa perhap one of those case
in which advic is good or bad onli as the event decides;
and for myself i certainli never should in ani circumst
of toler similar give such advic but i mean that i wa right
in submit to her and that if i had done otherwis i should have
suffer more in continu the engag than i did even in give it up
becaus i should have suffer in my conscienc i have now
as far as such a sentiment is allow in human natur noth
to reproach myself with; and if i mistak not a strong sens of duti
is no bad part of a woman portion

he look at her look at ladi russel and look again at her
repli as if in cool deliberation--

not yet but there are hope of her be forgiven in time
i trust to be in chariti with her soon but i too have been
think over the past and a question ha suggest itself
whether there may not have been one person more my enemi
even than that lady? my own self tell me if when i return
to england in the year eight with a few thousand pound
and wa post into the laconia if i had then written to you
would you have answer my letter? would you in short
have renew the engag then?

would i! wa all her answer; but the accent wa decis enough

good god! he cri you would! it is not that i did not think of it
or desir it as what could alon crown all my other success;
but i wa proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you
i shut my eye and would not understand you or do you justic
thi is a recollect which ought to make me forgiv everi one
sooner than myself six year of separ and suffer
might have been spare it is a sort of pain too which is new to me
i have been use to the gratif of believ myself to earn
everi bless that i enjoy i have valu myself on honour toil
and just reward like other great men under revers he ad
with a smile i must endeavour to subdu my mind to my fortun
i must learn to brook be happier than i deserv



chapter 24


who can be in doubt of what followed? when ani two young peopl
take it into their head to marri they are pretti sure by persever
to carri their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprud
or ever so littl like to be necessari to each other ultim comfort
thi may be bad moral to conclud with but i believ it to be truth;
and if such parti succeed how should a captain wentworth and
an ann elliot with the advantag of matur of mind
conscious of right and one independ fortun between them
fail of bear down everi opposition? they might in fact
have born down a great deal more than they met with for there wa
littl to distress them beyond the want of gracious and warmth
sir walter made no object and elizabeth did noth wors
than look cold and unconcern captain wentworth with five-and-twenti
thousand pound and as high in hi profess as merit and activ
could place him wa no longer nobodi he wa now esteem quit worthi
to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet
who had not had principl or sens enough to maintain himself
in the situat in which provid had place him and who could
give hi daughter at present but a small part of the share
of ten thousand pound which must be her hereaft

sir walter inde though he had no affect for ann
and no vaniti flatter to make him realli happi on the occas
wa veri far from think it a bad match for her on the contrari
when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedli by daylight
and eye him well he wa veri much struck by hi person claim
and felt that hi superior of appear might be not unfairli balanc
against her superior of rank; and all thi assist by
hi well-sound name enabl sir walter at last to prepar hi pen
with a veri good grace for the insert of the marriag
in the volum of honour

the onli one among them whose opposit of feel could excit
ani seriou anxieti wa ladi russel ann knew that ladi russel
must be suffer some pain in understand and relinquish mr elliot
and be make some struggl to becom truli acquaint with
and do justic to captain wentworth thi howev wa what
ladi russel had now to do she must learn to feel that she had
been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairli influenc
by appear in each; that becaus captain wentworth manner
had not suit her own idea she had been too quick in suspect them
to indic a charact of danger impetuosity; and that becaus
mr elliot manner had precis pleas her in their proprieti
and correct their gener polit and suaviti she had been
too quick in receiv them as the certain result of the most correct
opinion and well-regul mind there wa noth less
for ladi russel to do than to admit that she had been
pretti complet wrong and to take up a new set of opinion
and of hope

there is a quick of percept in some a niceti in the discern
of charact a natur penetr in short which no experi
in other can equal and ladi russel had been less gift
in thi part of understand than her young friend but she wa
a veri good woman and if her second object wa to be sensibl
and well-judg her first wa to see ann happi she love ann
better than she love her own abilities; and when the awkward
of the begin wa over found littl hardship in attach herself
as a mother to the man who wa secur the happi of her other child

of all the famili mari wa probabl the one most immedi gratifi
by the circumst it wa credit to have a sister marri
and she might flatter herself with have been greatli instrument
to the connexion by keep ann with her in the autumn;
and as her own sister must be better than her husband sister
it wa veri agreeabl that captain wentworth should be a richer man than
either captain benwick or charl hayter she had someth to suffer
perhap when they came into contact again in see ann restor
to the right of senior and the mistress of a veri pretti landaulette;
but she had a futur to look forward to of power consol
ann had no uppercross hall befor her no land estat
no headship of a family; and if they could but keep captain wentworth
from be made a baronet she would not chang situat with ann

it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equal satisfi
with her situat for a chang is not veri probabl there
she had soon the mortif of see mr elliot withdraw
and no one of proper condit ha sinc present himself to rais
even the unfound hope which sunk with him

the news of hi cousin ann engag burst on mr elliot
most unexpectedli it derang hi best plan of domest happi
hi best hope of keep sir walter singl by the watch
which a son-in-law right would have given but though discomfit
and disappoint he could still do someth for hi own interest
and hi own enjoy he soon quit bath; and on mr clay
quit it soon afterward and be next heard of as establish
under hi protect in london it wa evid how doubl a game
he had been play and how determin he wa to save himself
from be cut out by one art woman at least

mr clay affect had overpow her interest and she had sacrif
for the young man sake the possibl of scheme longer
for sir walter she ha abil howev as well as affections;
and it is now a doubt point whether hi cun or her
may final carri the day; whether after prevent her from be
the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedl and caress at last
into make her the wife of sir william

it cannot be doubt that sir walter and elizabeth were shock
and mortifi by the loss of their companion and the discoveri of
their decept in her they had their great cousin to be sure
to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter
and follow other without be flatter and follow in turn
is but a state of half enjoy

ann satisfi at a veri earli period of ladi russel mean
to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy
to the happi of her prospect than what aros from the conscious
of have no relat to bestow on him which a man of sens could valu
there she felt her own inferior veri keenli the disproport
in their fortun wa nothing; it did not give her a moment regret;
but to have no famili to receiv and estim him properli
noth of respect of harmoni of good will to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcom which met her
in hi brother and sister wa a sourc of as live pain
as her mind could well be sensibl of under circumst of otherwis
strong felic she had but two friend in the world to add to hi list
ladi russel and mr smith to those howev he wa veri well dispos
to attach himself ladi russel in spite of all her former transgress
he could now valu from hi heart while he wa not oblig to say
that he believ her to have been right in origin divid them
he wa readi to say almost everyth els in her favour
and as for mr smith she had claim of variou kind to recommend her
quickli and perman

her recent good offic by ann had been enough in themselv
and their marriag instead of depriv her of one friend
secur her two she wa their earliest visitor in their settl life;
and captain wentworth by put her in the way of recov
her husband properti in the west indi by write for her
act for her and see her through all the petti difficulti
of the case with the activ and exert of a fearless man
and a determin friend fulli requit the servic which
she had render or ever meant to render to hi wife

mr smith enjoy were not spoil by thi improv of incom
with some improv of health and the acquisit of such friend
to be often with for her cheer and mental alacr did not
fail her; and while these prime suppli of good remain she might have
bid defianc even to greater access of worldli prosper
she might have been absolut rich and perfectli healthi
and yet be happi her spring of felic wa in the glow
of her spirit as her friend ann wa in the warmth of her heart
ann wa tender itself and she had the full worth of it
in captain wentworth affect hi profess wa all that could ever
make her friend wish that tender less the dread of a futur war
all that could dim her sunshin she glori in be a sailor wife
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belong to that profess
which is if possibl more distinguish in it domest virtu
than in it nation import
