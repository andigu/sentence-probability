brian fisher also say that farm cost thing like fertilis and fuel will actual increas by about one per cent now on oil the benchmark for oil price that west texa intermedi crude thatll stay high in the near term but over the medium term down from the current 65 dollar a barrel down below $40 a barrel by 2010 on the dollar a moder depreci around us73c for 06-07 continu down though by 2010-11 that a long way ahead but brian fisher say perhap around us65c for the australian dollar
alan oster (nation australia bank): we think the aussi dollar is probabl go to get down to the level that abar talk about except that we think it go to come down a lot quicker so we expect someth like 68c by thi time next year
matt osullivan: and that go to have a big impact on exports?
jame martin: it clearli help in some sens in the sens that it mean your more competit but if your on the import side the oil price goe down in us dollar but it realli doesnt go down at all
matt osullivan: now i dont think youv got veri good news about rural commod prices?
jame martin: again part of thi is that we have a faster fall in the currenc is that in our view when we look at us dollar agricultur price were down around ten per cent now part of that is beef which ha come off realli high level and we think sugar eventu will start to slow down as well so were expect price to come back and the volum broadli to offset that so you get those differ effect come through
matt osullivan: so that might be a faster impact than what abar predicting?
jame martin: ye
matt osullivan: youv also been talk about continu concern about the labour shortag particularli skill labour?
jame martin: ye when we run our busi survey we find it is veri difficult in fact even in decemb thi year it more difficult accord to busi to get suitabl labour than ani time includ the late 80
matt osullivan: so the concern is alway will that show up in wages?
jame martin: at thi stage the good news is noth happen that whi the reserv bank is still talk about if were go to move rate it more like up than down at the end of the day our view on rate will be they wont do anyth but the wage one is critic and if they see ani sign of wage pressur start to move up then they will pull the trigger
matt osullivan: will the import of labour be like to hold off wage increases?
jame martin: to the extent that you can take some pressur off by increas the level of immigr that clearli doe help and in the rural sector we know about difficulti of get peopl in to help with crop so it help there but at the end of the day i think ye there an element of that but i think also the domest part of the economi is realli start to slow a bit as well so i think unemploy go to go from 52 53 up to about 57 58 and that will help so i think the fact is that within the economi as such your probabl not go to have to do anyth
matthew osullivan: around australia your listen to a special broadcast of nation rural news from the abar outlook confer in canberra

matthew osullivan: what about these guest worker schemes? are they have an impact in your sector?
john roach: if i look at other countri ye it doe if i look at new zealand part of the horticultur industri in new zealand doe use what i call cheaper labour what theyr do there is bring it it in upskil it there and send it back to those countri as part of their aid project for exampl we in australia dont have that opportun at the moment but if i look at the farm unit in itself as veget grower much of the innov happen on small to medium farm busi it not the big end of town in veget product so that area is where the innov happen youd requir less labour in that but youd need more specialis labour
matthew osullivan: is there a need to protect smaller farmer in the future?
john roach: it more about go to inform choic the veget industri in particular will segment itself into three area one is larger product larger farm work on lower cost the middl section is about innov smaller farm unit be out there on the cut edg the last third of the industri produc about five per cent of product i think provid inform choic for that sector of what they actual do with their live and their farm and their asset i think it realli import for australia on social content to be abl to allow those peopl to make inform choic about whether they wish to grow or not grow and depart

live at the agricultur australia 2006 confer
matt osullivan bring you nation rural news today live from the agricultur australia confer in sydney
matthew osullivan: hello im matt osullivan bring you nation rural news today from the agricultur australia confer in sydney the peak gather for the grain industri
as youd expect the futur of the singl desk for wheat export is a hot topic and confus seem to be the common theme
the futur of gm crop is also be debat today and of cours there plenti of specul about whether well actual get a decent grain harvest thi season - as the ongo dri drag on mani part of australia desper need follow up rain
but everybodi seem to be talk about altern fuel with crude oil price hit new high thi week deleg believ it time the feder govern offer new incent to make the switch to ethanol and biodiesel
delegate: i think there is such an abund of energi in australia you know theyr not veri worri about it they might as well just sit on their ars and not worri about it
delegate: were not get ani result at all with the biofuel the govern just not interest to mandat it and thi is not actual go to get off the ground until it actual mandat so it realli up to the govern
delegate: thi issu is now on the tabl it here and we cant afford to be sit in here in three year time not realli know where well be and not pick up on the advantag that is there right now
delegate: i fulli support the biofuel concept in industri i disagre with the fact that theyll be get an excis and i want a level play field in term of acquisit of raw materi
mos: certainli there a feel that the govern need to do more and the grain industri need to do more as well to get on the front foot and make sure that grain grower have a big slice of thi market for grain there doe seem to be a concern that australia is a long way behind other countri in tap into the ethanol and biodiesel market one of the speaker here today is terri reinhart from advanc trade in the us thank for join us can you give us an idea of the industri in the us?
terri reinhart: today it about a 42 billion gallon industri which compar to five year ago when it wa about a 1 billion gallon industri and project are that by 2010 itll be a 10 billion gallon industri
mos: so doe a countri like australia have a long way to go to tri and catch up to that? can we catch up to that?
tr: the good news about ethanol is it a 3000-year-old process by which you take corn and distil it into ethanol so it not real rocket scienc and if you have the money it fairli quick to build you can build a 100 million gallon plant in 15 to 16 month so it not like it take 20 year to develop thi thing
mos: one of the big concern here is from end user of feed grain that itll be much more expens and itll be harder to get access to that grain how is the corn go into ethanol in the us affect the market there?
tr: to date there hasnt been ani effect on the end user becaus corn is still rel cheap today in the us were over suppli with corn which is one of the motiv to develop ethanol as a demand for corn but down the road as we continu to increas their product were go to have to price corn as fuel as oppos to price corn as food and the livestock produc is concern greatli in the us also
mos: that i think is go to be a grow theme isnt it that you have more and more differ type of grain go into produc fuel and into produc food when that a big issue?
tr: yeah it a big issu and you can kind of sum up the whole thing if you go back to i think it wa 1998 one barrel of crude would buy 47 bushel of corn and today one barrel of crude would buy 30 bushel of corn so the price relationship strongli favour corn as a fuel as oppos to be a food
mos: in term of the us industri here in australia weve got a lot of differ plant set up in small oper there no sort of overal structur is that go to tell against australia in the long run?
tr: i dont know in the us there not much structur at thi point either the earli peopl in the ethanol industri were the cargil and the adm of the world theyv been make ethanol for quit some time but all the new capac or much of the new capac is small start-up oper group of farmer go togeth invest in ethanol plant and there not much organis today to all the ethanol plant that are out there and time will tell my guess is some of these plant are built in the right place and some of them arent and well just have to see over time which one were built in the right place
mos: i see a stori quot sir richard branson say he invest in ethanol plant in the us are they start to attract that big busi investment?
tr: ye earli on four or five year ago capit wa a problem and you just work and work and work to tri and find enough money to build an ethanol plant to put it in perspect to build a 100 million gallon plant - which is the one theyr build now - it take about $170 million to build that plant wherea five or 10 year ago it wa terribl difficult to rais that money today your hear stori of peopl rais that kind of money in 30 and 60 day period
mos: so there reason for farmer get involv in thi to have some hope that it will take-off?
tr: in the us id say it ha taken off it realli ha and the limit resourc in the us right now is plant capac and if we build all the plant that are on the draw board today the limit resourc is soon go to becom farmland enough land to produc enough corn to feed the ethanol plant
mos: thank for your time terri reinhart from advanc trade in the us
