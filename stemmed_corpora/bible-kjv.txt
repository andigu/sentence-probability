3:3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden
god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
ye die

3:4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not sure die: 3:5
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eye shall

say thou shalt not eat of it: curs is the ground for thi sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the day of thi life; 3:18 thorn
also and thistl shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field; 3:19 in the sweat of thi face shalt thou eat bread

41:26 the seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ear are
seven years: the dream is one

41:27 and the seven thin and ill favour kine that came up after them

abomin unto the egyptian

43:33 and they sat befor him the firstborn accord to hi

servant it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord
bondmen

44:10 and he said now also let it be accord unto your words: he

44:15 and joseph said unto them what deed is thi that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as i can certainli divine? 44:16 and judah
said what shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how
shall we clear ourselves? god hath found out the iniqu of thi
servants: behold we are my lord servant both we and he also with
whom the cup is found

44:17 and he said god forbid that i should do so: but the man in
whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant; and as for you
get you up in peac unto your father

44:18 then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thi
servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord ear and let not
thine anger burn against thi servant: for thou art even as pharaoh

44:19 my lord ask hi servant say have ye a father or a
brother? 44:20 and we said unto my lord we have a father an old
man and a child of hi old age a littl one; and hi brother is
dead and he alon is left of hi mother and hi father loveth him

44:21 and thou saidst unto thi servant bring him down unto me that
i may set mine eye upon him

44:22 and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leav hi father: for
if he should leav hi father hi father would die

44:23 and thou saidst unto thi servant except your youngest brother

44:24 and it came to pass when we came up unto thi servant my father
we told him the word of my lord

44:25 and our father said go again and buy us a littl food

44:26 and we said we cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with

my gray hair with sorrow to the grave

44:30 now therefor when i come to thi servant my father and the lad
be not with us; see that hi life is bound up in the lad life;
44:31 it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with
us that he will die: and thi servant shall bring down the gray hair
of thi servant our father with sorrow to the grave

44:32 for thi servant becam sureti for the lad unto my father
say if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to
my father for ever

44:33 now therefor i pray thee let thi servant abid instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with hi brethren

44:34 for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me?
lest peradventur i see the evil that shall come on my father

45:1 then joseph could not refrain himself befor all them that stood
by him; and he cri caus everi man to go out from me and there
stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto hi
brethren

45:2 and he wept aloud: and the egyptian and the hous of pharaoh

yet live? and hi brethren could not answer him; for they were
troubl at hi presenc

45:4 and joseph said unto hi brethren come near to me i pray you
and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye

45:16 and the fame thereof wa heard in pharaoh hous say

against us and so get them up out of the land

1:11 therefor they did set over them taskmast to afflict them with
their burden and they built for pharaoh treasur citi pithom and
raams

1:12 but the more they afflict them the more they multipli and
grew

and they were griev becaus of the children of israel

1:13 and the egyptian made the children of israel to serv with
rigour: 1:14 and they made their live bitter with hard bondag in
morter and in brick and in all manner of servic in the field: all
their servic wherein they made them serv wa with rigour

1:15 and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwiv of which the

he said when ye do the offic of a midwif to the hebrew women and

alive? 1:19 and the midwiv said unto pharaoh becaus the hebrew
women are not as the egyptian women; for they are live and are

1:20 therefor god dealt well with the midwives: and the peopl

1:21 and it came to pass becaus the midwiv fear god that he
made them hous

1:22 and pharaoh charg all hi peopl say everi son that is

he wa a goodli child she hid him three month

2:3 and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of
bulrush and daub it with slime and with pitch and put the child

2:4 and hi sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him

2:5 and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the

saw the ark among the flag she sent her maid to fetch it

2:6 and when she had open it she saw the child: and behold the
babe wept and she had compass on him and said thi is one of the
hebrew children

2:7 then said hi sister to pharaoh daughter shall i go and call to
thee a nurs of the hebrew women that she may nurs the child for
thee? 2:8 and pharaoh daughter said to her go and the maid went
and call the child mother

2:9 and pharaoh daughter said unto her take thi child away and
nurs it for me and i will give thee thi wage and the women took
the child and nurs it

2:10 and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaoh daughter
and he becam her son and she call hi name moses: and she said

2:13 and when he went out the second day behold two men of the
hebrew strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong
wherefor smitest thou thi fellow? 2:14 and he said who made thee a
princ and a judg over us? intendest thou to kill me as thou
killedst the egyptian? and mose fear and said sure thi thing
is known

2:15 now when pharaoh heard thi thing he sought to slay mose but
mose fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian:
and he sat down by a well

2:16 now the priest of midian had seven daughters: and they came and
drew water and fill the trough to water their father flock

2:17 and the shepherd came and drove them away: but mose stood up

us and water the flock

2:20 and he said unto hi daughter and where is he? whi is it that
ye have left the man? call him that he may eat bread

2:21 and mose wa content to dwell with the man: and he gave mose
zipporah hi daughter

2:22 and she bare him a son and he call hi name gershom: for he
said i have been a stranger in a strang land

2:23 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt

3:6 moreov he said i am the god of thi father the god of abraham

wa afraid to look upon god

3:7 and the lord said i have sure seen the afflict of my peopl
which are in egypt and have heard their cri by reason of their
taskmasters; for i know their sorrows; 3:8 and i am come down to
deliv them out of the hand of the egyptian and to bring them up

neither heretofor nor sinc thou hast spoken unto thi servant: but i
am slow of speech and of a slow tongu

4:11 and the lord said unto him who hath made man mouth? or who

afflict then they bow their head and worship

5:1 and afterward mose and aaron went in and told pharaoh thu
saith the lord god of israel let my peopl go that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilder

5:2 and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey hi voic to
let israel go? i know not the lord neither will i let israel go

5:3 and they said the god of the hebrew hath met with us: let us go
we pray thee three day journey into the desert and sacrific unto
the lord our god; lest he fall upon us with pestil or with the
sword

5:4 and the king of egypt said unto them wherefor do ye mose and

you and judge; becaus ye have made our savour to be abhor in the
eye of pharaoh and in the eye of hi servant to put a sword in

5:23 for sinc i came to pharaoh to speak in thi name he hath done
evil to thi people; neither hast thou deliv thi peopl at all

6:1 then the lord said unto mose now shalt thou see what i will do
to pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a

of god almighti but by my name jehovah wa i not known to them

6:4 and i have also establish my coven with them to give them

9:16 and in veri deed for thi caus have i rais thee up for to
shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declar throughout all

the foundat thereof even until now

9:19 send therefor now and gather thi cattl and all that thou hast

field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon

9:20 he that fear the word of the lord among the servant of pharaoh
made hi servant and hi cattl flee into the houses: 9:21 and he
that regard not the word of the lord left hi servant and hi
cattl in the field

9:22 and the lord said unto mose stretch forth thine hand toward

peopl are wick

9:28 intreat the lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighti
thunder and hail; and i will let you go and ye shall stay no

9:29 and mose said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the citi i
will spread abroad my hand unto the lord; and the thunder shall
ceas neither shall there be ani more hail; that thou mayest know how
that the earth is the lord

9:30 but as for thee and thi servant i know that ye will not yet

9:31 and the flax and the barley wa smitten: for the barley wa in
the ear and the flax wa boll

9:32 but the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not

9:33 and mose went out of the citi from pharaoh and spread abroad

10:3 and mose and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thu

10:4 els if thou refus to let my peopl go behold to morrow will

of the earth that one cannot be abl to see the earth: and they shall
eat the residu of that which is escap which remaineth unto you
from the hail and shall eat everi tree which groweth for you out of

10:7 and pharaoh servant said unto him how long shall thi man be

god: knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed? 10:8 and mose and
aaron were brought again unto pharaoh: and he said unto them go
serv the lord your god: but who are they that shall go? 10:9 and
mose said we will go with our young and with our old with our son
and with our daughter with our flock and with our herd will we go;
for we must hold a feast unto the lord

10:10 and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will
let you go and your littl ones: look to it; for evil is befor you

10:11 not so: go now ye that are men and serv the lord; for that ye

10:14 and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rest in
all the coast of egypt: veri grievou were they; befor them there
were no such locust as they neither after them shall be such

10:15 for they cover the face of the whole earth so that the land
wa darkened; and they did eat everi herb of the land and all the
fruit of the tree which the hail had left: and there remain not ani
green thing in the tree or in the herb of the field through all
the land of egypt

10:16 then pharaoh call for mose and aaron in haste; and he said i
have sin against the lord your god and against you

10:17 now therefor forgiv i pray thee my sin onli thi onc and
intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me thi death

10:24 and pharaoh call unto mose and said go ye serv the lord;
onli let your flock and your herd be stayed: let your littl one

10:28 and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to
thyself see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou
shalt die

10:29 and mose said thou hast spoken well i will see thi face again
no more

11:1 and the lord said unto mose yet will i bring one plagu more
upon pharaoh and upon egypt; afterward he will let you go hence:
when he shall let you go he shall sure thrust you out henc
altogeth

11:2 speak now in the ear of the peopl and let everi man borrow of

throne even unto the firstborn of the maidserv that is behind the
mill; and all the firstborn of beast

11:6 and there shall be a great cri throughout all the land of egypt
such as there wa none like it nor shall be like it ani more

11:7 but against ani of the children of israel shall not a dog move
hi tongu against man or beast: that ye may know how that the lord

12:49 one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger

12:50 thu did all the children of israel; as the lord command mose
and aaron so did they

12:51 and it came to pass the selfsam day that the lord did bring
the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armi

13:1 and the lord spake unto mose say 13:2 sanctifi unto me all
the firstborn whatsoev openeth the womb among the children of
israel both of man and of beast: it is mine

13:3 and mose said unto the peopl rememb thi day in which ye

hand the lord brought you out from thi place: there shall no leaven
bread be eaten

13:4 thi day came ye out in the month abib

13:5 and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of

and the jebusit which he sware unto thi father to give thee a
land flow with milk and honey that thou shalt keep thi servic in

13:8 and thou shalt shew thi son in that day say thi is done
becaus of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of
egypt

13:9 and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a
memori between thine eye that the lord law may be in thi mouth:
for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt

13:10 thou shalt therefor keep thi ordin in hi season from year

13:11 and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of
the canaanit as he sware unto thee and to thi father and shall

13:13 and everi firstl of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and
if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break hi neck: and all
the firstborn of man among thi children shalt thou redeem

13:14 and it shall be when thi son asketh thee in time to come
say what is this? that thou shalt say unto him by strength of
hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the hous of bondage:
13:15 and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardli let us go that
the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the
firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast: therefor i sacrific to
the lord all that openeth the matrix be males; but all the
firstborn of my children i redeem

13:16 and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlet
between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth
out of egypt

13:17 and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the peopl go that
god led them not through the way of the land of the philistin
although that wa near; for god said lest peradventur the peopl
repent when they see war and they return to egypt: 13:18 but god led
the peopl about through the way of the wilder of the red sea:
and the children of israel went up har out of the land of egypt

13:19 and mose took the bone of joseph with him: for he had straitli
sworn the children of israel say god will sure visit you; and
ye shall carri up my bone away henc with you

13:20 and they took their journey from succoth and encamp in etham
in the edg of the wilder

13:21 and the lord went befor them by day in a pillar of a cloud to
lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire to give them
light; to go by day and night: 13:22 he took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from befor the
peopl

14:1 and the lord spake unto mose say 14:2 speak unto the
children of israel that they turn and encamp befor pihahiroth
between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon: befor it shall
ye encamp by the sea

14:3 for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are
entangl in the land the wilder hath shut them in

14:4 and i will harden pharaoh heart that he shall follow after
them; and i will be honour upon pharaoh and upon all hi host; that
the egyptian may know that i am the lord and they did so

14:5 and it wa told the king of egypt that the peopl fled: and the
heart of pharaoh and of hi servant wa turn against the peopl
and they said whi have we done thi that we have let israel go from
serv us? 14:6 and he made readi hi chariot and took hi peopl
with him: 14:7 and he took six hundr chosen chariot and all the
chariot of egypt and captain over everi one of them

14:8 and the lord harden the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he

14:9 but the egyptian pursu after them all the hors and chariot
of pharaoh and hi horsemen and hi armi and overtook them
encamp by the sea besid pihahiroth befor baalzephon

14:10 and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lift up
their eye and behold the egyptian march after them; and they
were sore afraid: and the children of israel cri out unto the lord

14:11 and they said unto mose becaus there were no grave in egypt
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefor hast thou
dealt thu with us to carri us forth out of egypt? 14:12 is not thi
the word that we did tell thee in egypt say let us alon that we
may serv the egyptians? for it had been better for us to serv the
egyptian than that we should die in the wilder

14:13 and mose said unto the peopl fear ye not stand still and
see the salvat of the lord which he will shew to you to day: for
the egyptian whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no
more for ever

14:14 the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peac

14:15 and the lord said unto mose wherefor criest thou unto me?
speak unto the children of israel that they go forward: 14:16 but
lift thou up thi rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and
divid it: and the children of israel shall go on dri ground through
the midst of the sea

14:17 and i behold i will harden the heart of the egyptian and
they shall follow them: and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and
upon all hi host upon hi chariot and upon hi horsemen

14:18 and the egyptian shall know that i am the lord when i have
gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon hi chariot and upon hi
horsemen

14:19 and the angel of god which went befor the camp of israel
remov and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from
befor their face and stood behind them: 14:20 and it came between
the camp of the egyptian and the camp of israel; and it wa a cloud
and dark to them but it gave light by night to these: so that the
one came not near the other all the night

14:21 and mose stretch out hi hand over the sea; and the lord
caus the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and
made the sea dri land and the water were divid

14:22 and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon
the dri ground: and the water were a wall unto them on their right
hand and on their left

14:23 and the egyptian pursu and went in after them to the midst
of the sea even all pharaoh hors hi chariot and hi horsemen

14:24 and it came to pass that in the morn watch the lord look
unto the host of the egyptian through the pillar of fire and of the
cloud and troubl the host of the egyptian 14:25 and took off
their chariot wheel that they drave them heavily: so that the
egyptian said let us flee from the face of israel; for the lord
fighteth for them against the egyptian

14:26 and the lord said unto mose stretch out thine hand over the
sea that the water may come again upon the egyptian upon their
chariot and upon their horsemen

14:27 and mose stretch forth hi hand over the sea and the sea
return to hi strength when the morn appeared; and the egyptian
fled against it; and the lord overthrew the egyptian in the midst of
the sea

14:28 and the water return and cover the chariot and the
horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after
them; there remain not so much as one of them

14:29 but the children of israel walk upon dri land in the midst of
the sea; and the water were a wall unto them on their right hand and
on their left

14:30 thu the lord save israel that day out of the hand of the
egyptians; and israel saw the egyptian dead upon the sea shore

14:31 and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the
egyptians: and the peopl fear the lord and believ the lord and
hi servant mose

15:1 then sang mose and the children of israel thi song unto the
lord and spake say i will sing unto the lord for he hath
triumph gloriously: the hors and hi rider hath he thrown into the
sea

15:2 the lord is my strength and song and he is becom my salvation:
he is my god and i will prepar him an habitation; my father god
and i will exalt him

15:3 the lord is a man of war: the lord is hi name

15:4 pharaoh chariot and hi host hath he cast into the sea: hi
chosen captain also are drown in the red sea

15:5 the depth have cover them: they sank into the bottom as a
stone

15:6 thi right hand o lord is becom gloriou in power: thi right
hand o lord hath dash in piec the enemi

15:7 and in the great of thine excel thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thi wrath which
consum them as stubbl

15:8 and with the blast of thi nostril the water were gather
togeth the flood stood upright as an heap and the depth were
congeal in the heart of the sea

15:9 the enemi said i will pursu i will overtak i will divid the
spoil; my lust shall be satisfi upon them; i will draw my sword my
hand shall destroy them

15:10 thou didst blow with thi wind the sea cover them: they sank
as lead in the mighti water

15:11 who is like unto thee o lord among the gods? who is like thee
gloriou in holi fear in prais do wonders? 15:12 thou
stretchedst out thi right hand the earth swallow them

15:13 thou in thi merci hast led forth the peopl which thou hast
redeemed: thou hast guid them in thi strength unto thi holi
habit

15:14 the peopl shall hear and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on
the inhabit of palestina

15:15 then the duke of edom shall be amazed; the mighti men of moab
trembl shall take hold upon them; all the inhabit of canaan
shall melt away

15:16 fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the great of thine
arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thi peopl pass over o
lord till the peopl pass over which thou hast purchas

15:17 thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of
thine inherit in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee
to dwell in in the sanctuari o lord which thi hand have
establish

15:18 the lord shall reign for ever and ever

15:19 for the hors of pharaoh went in with hi chariot and with hi
horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the water of the
sea upon them; but the children of israel went on dri land in the
midst of the sea

15:20 and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel
in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrel and
with danc

15:21 and miriam answer them sing ye to the lord for he hath
triumph gloriously; the hors and hi rider hath he thrown into the
sea

15:22 so mose brought israel from the red sea and they went out into
the wilder of shur; and they went three day in the wilder
and found no water

15:23 and when they came to marah they could not drink of the water
of marah for they were bitter: therefor the name of it wa call
marah

15:24 and the peopl murmur against mose say what shall we
drink? 15:25 and he cri unto the lord; and the lord shew him a
tree which when he had cast into the water the water were made
sweet: there he made for them a statut and an ordin and there he
prove them 15:26 and said if thou wilt dilig hearken to the
voic of the lord thi god and wilt do that which is right in hi
sight and wilt give ear to hi command and keep all hi
statut i will put none of these diseas upon thee which i have
brought upon the egyptians: for i am the lord that healeth thee

15:27 and they came to elim where were twelv well of water and
threescor and ten palm trees: and they encamp there by the water

16:1 and they took their journey from elim and all the congreg
of the children of israel came unto the wilder of sin which is
between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after
their depart out of the land of egypt

16:2 and the whole congreg of the children of israel murmur
against mose and aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 and the children of
israel said unto them would to god we had die by the hand of the
lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pot and when we
did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into thi
wilder to kill thi whole assembl with hunger

16:4 then said the lord unto mose behold i will rain bread from
heaven for you; and the peopl shall go out and gather a certain rate
everi day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or
no

16:5 and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall
prepar that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as
they gather daili

16:6 and mose and aaron said unto all the children of israel at
even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the
land of egypt: 16:7 and in the morn then ye shall see the glori of
the lord; for that he heareth your murmur against the lord: and
what are we that ye murmur against us? 16:8 and mose said thi
shall be when the lord shall give you in the even flesh to eat
and in the morn bread to the full; for that the lord heareth your
murmur which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your
murmur are not against us but against the lord

16:9 and mose spake unto aaron say unto all the congreg of the
children of israel come near befor the lord: for he hath heard your
murmur

16:10 and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congreg
of the children of israel that they look toward the wilder
and behold the glori of the lord appear in the cloud

16:11 and the lord spake unto mose say 16:12 i have heard the
murmur of the children of israel: speak unto them say at even
ye shall eat flesh and in the morn ye shall be fill with bread;
and ye shall know that i am the lord your god

16:13 and it came to pass that at even the quail came up and
cover the camp: and in the morn the dew lay round about the host

16:14 and when the dew that lay wa gone up behold upon the face of
the wilder there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar
frost on the ground

16:15 and when the children of israel saw it they said one to
anoth it is manna: for they wist not what it wa and mose said
unto them thi is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat

16:16 thi is the thing which the lord hath command gather of it
everi man accord to hi eat an omer for everi man accord to
the number of your persons; take ye everi man for them which are in
hi tent

16:17 and the children of israel did so and gather some more some
less

16:18 and when they did mete it with an omer he that gather much
had noth over and he that gather littl had no lack; they
gather everi man accord to hi eat

16:19 and mose said let no man leav of it till the morn

16:20 notwithstand they hearken not unto moses; but some of them
left of it until the morn and it bred worm and stank: and mose
wa wroth with them

16:21 and they gather it everi morn everi man accord to hi
eating: and when the sun wax hot it melt

16:22 and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gather twice
as much bread two omer for one man: and all the ruler of the
congreg came and told mose

16:23 and he said unto them thi is that which the lord hath said to
morrow is the rest of the holi sabbath unto the lord: bake that which
ye will bake to day and seeth that ye will seethe; and that which
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morn

16:24 and they laid it up till the morn as mose bade: and it did
not stink neither wa there ani worm therein

16:25 and mose said eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
the lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field

16:26 six day ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day which is
the sabbath in it there shall be none

16:27 and it came to pass that there went out some of the peopl on
the seventh day for to gather and they found none

16:28 and the lord said unto mose how long refus ye to keep my
command and my laws? 16:29 see for that the lord hath given you
the sabbath therefor he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days; abid ye everi man in hi place let no man go out of hi place
on the seventh day

16:30 so the peopl rest on the seventh day

16:31 and the hous of israel call the name thereof manna: and it
wa like coriand seed white; and the tast of it wa like wafer
made with honey

16:32 and mose said thi is the thing which the lord commandeth
fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see
the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilder when i brought
you forth from the land of egypt

16:33 and mose said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of
manna therein and lay it up befor the lord to be kept for your
gener

16:34 as the lord command mose so aaron laid it up befor the
testimoni to be kept

16:35 and the children of israel did eat manna forti year until they
came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna until they came unto the
border of the land of canaan

16:36 now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah

17:1 and all the congreg of the children of israel journey from
the wilder of sin after their journey accord to the
command of the lord and pitch in rephidim: and there wa no
water for the peopl to drink

17:2 wherefor the peopl did chide with mose and said give us
water that we may drink and mose said unto them whi chide ye with
me? wherefor do ye tempt the lord? 17:3 and the peopl thirst
there for water; and the peopl murmur against mose and said
wherefor is thi that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill
us and our children and our cattl with thirst? 17:4 and mose cri
unto the lord say what shall i do unto thi people? they be
almost readi to stone me

17:5 and the lord said unto mose go on befor the peopl and take
with thee of the elder of israel; and thi rod wherewith thou smotest
the river take in thine hand and go

17:6 behold i will stand befor thee there upon the rock in horeb;
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it
that the peopl may drink and mose did so in the sight of the elder
of israel

17:7 and he call the name of the place massah and meribah becaus
of the chide of the children of israel and becaus they tempt the
lord say is the lord among us or not? 17:8 then came amalek
and fought with israel in rephidim

17:9 and mose said unto joshua choos us out men and go out fight
with amalek: to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of god in mine hand

17:10 so joshua did as mose had said to him and fought with amalek:
and mose aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill

17:11 and it came to pass when mose held up hi hand that israel
prevailed: and when he let down hi hand amalek prevail

17:12 but mose hand were heavy; and they took a stone and put it
under him and he sat thereon; and aaron and hur stay up hi hand
the one on the one side and the other on the other side; and hi
hand were steadi until the go down of the sun

17:13 and joshua discomfit amalek and hi peopl with the edg of
the sword

17:14 and the lord said unto mose write thi for a memori in a
book and rehears it in the ear of joshua: for i will utterli put
out the remembr of amalek from under heaven

17:15 and mose built an altar and call the name of it
jehovahnissi: 17:16 for he said becaus the lord hath sworn that the
lord will have war with amalek from gener to gener

18:1 when jethro the priest of midian mose father in law heard of
all that god had done for mose and for israel hi peopl and that
the lord had brought israel out of egypt; 18:2 then jethro mose
father in law took zipporah mose wife after he had sent her back
18:3 and her two sons; of which the name of the one wa gershom; for
he said i have been an alien in a strang land: 18:4 and the name of
the other wa eliezer; for the god of my father said he wa mine
help and deliv me from the sword of pharaoh: 18:5 and jethro
mose father in law came with hi son and hi wife unto mose into
the wilder where he encamp at the mount of god: 18:6 and he
said unto mose i thi father in law jethro am come unto thee and thi
wife and her two son with her

18:7 and mose went out to meet hi father in law and did obeis
and kiss him; and they ask each other of their welfare; and they
came into the tent

18:8 and mose told hi father in law all that the lord had done unto
pharaoh and to the egyptian for israel sake and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way and how the lord deliv them

18:9 and jethro rejoic for all the good which the lord had done
to israel whom he had deliv out of the hand of the egyptian

18:10 and jethro said bless be the lord who hath deliv you out
of the hand of the egyptian and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath
deliv the peopl from under the hand of the egyptian

18:11 now i know that the lord is greater than all gods: for in the
thing wherein they dealt proudli he wa abov them

18:12 and jethro mose father in law took a burnt offer and
sacrific for god: and aaron came and all the elder of israel to
eat bread with mose father in law befor god

18:13 and it came to pass on the morrow that mose sat to judg the
people: and the peopl stood by mose from the morn unto the
even

18:14 and when mose father in law saw all that he did to the peopl
he said what is thi thing that thou doest to the people? whi sittest
thou thyself alon and all the peopl stand by thee from morn unto
even? 18:15 and mose said unto hi father in law becaus the peopl
come unto me to enquir of god: 18:16 when they have a matter they
come unto me; and i judg between one and anoth and i do make them
know the statut of god and hi law

18:17 and mose father in law said unto him the thing that thou
doest is not good

18:18 thou wilt sure wear away both thou and thi peopl that is
with thee: for thi thing is too heavi for thee; thou art not abl to
perform it thyself alon

18:19 hearken now unto my voic i will give thee counsel and god
shall be with thee: be thou for the peopl to god-ward that thou
mayest bring the caus unto god: 18:20 and thou shalt teach them
ordin and law and shalt shew them the way wherein they must
walk and the work that they must do

18:21 moreov thou shalt provid out of all the peopl abl men such
as fear god men of truth hate covetousness; and place such over
them to be ruler of thousand and ruler of hundr ruler of
fifti and ruler of tens: 18:22 and let them judg the peopl at
all seasons: and it shall be that everi great matter they shall bring
unto thee but everi small matter they shall judge: so shall it be
easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee

18:23 if thou shalt do thi thing and god command thee so then thou
shalt be abl to endur and all thi peopl shall also go to their
place in peac

18:24 so mose hearken to the voic of hi father in law and did
all that he had said

18:25 and mose chose abl men out of all israel and made them head
over the peopl ruler of thousand ruler of hundr ruler of
fifti and ruler of ten

18:26 and they judg the peopl at all seasons: the hard caus they
brought unto mose but everi small matter they judg themselv

18:27 and mose let hi father in law depart; and he went hi way into
hi own land

19:1 in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth
out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilder
of sinai

19:2 for they were depart from rephidim and were come to the desert
of sinai and had pitch in the wilderness; and there israel camp

19:3 and mose went up unto god and the lord call unto him out of
the mountain say thu shalt thou say to the hous of jacob and

19:5 now therefor if ye will obey my voic inde and keep my
coven then ye shall be a peculiar treasur unto me abov all
people: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 and ye shall be unto me a
kingdom of priest and an holi nation

these are the word which thou shalt speak unto the children of
israel

19:7 and mose came and call for the elder of the peopl and laid
befor their face all these word which the lord command him

19:8 and all the peopl answer togeth and said all that the lord
hath spoken we will do and mose return the word of the peopl
unto the lord

19:9 and the lord said unto mose lo i come unto thee in a thick
cloud that the peopl may hear when i speak with thee and believ
thee for ever

and mose told the word of the peopl unto the lord

19:10 and the lord said unto mose go unto the peopl and sanctifi
them to day and to morrow and let them wash their cloth 19:11 and
be readi against the third day: for the third day the lord will come
down in the sight of all the peopl upon mount sinai

19:12 and thou shalt set bound unto the peopl round about say
take heed to yourselv that ye go not up into the mount or touch
the border of it: whosoev toucheth the mount shall be sure put to
death: 19:13 there shall not an hand touch it but he shall sure be
stone or shot through; whether it be beast or man it shall not
live: when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount

19:14 and mose went down from the mount unto the peopl and
sanctifi the people; and they wash their cloth

19:15 and he said unto the peopl be readi against the third day:
come not at your wive

19:16 and it came to pass on the third day in the morn that there
were thunder and lightn and a thick cloud upon the mount and
the voic of the trumpet exceed loud; so that all the peopl that
wa in the camp trembl

19:17 and mose brought forth the peopl out of the camp to meet with
god; and they stood at the nether part of the mount

19:18 and mount sinai wa altogeth on a smoke becaus the lord
descend upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascend as the smoke
of a furnac and the whole mount quak greatli

19:19 and when the voic of the trumpet sound long and wax louder
and louder mose spake and god answer him by a voic

19:20 and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the
mount: and the lord call mose up to the top of the mount; and mose
went up

19:21 and the lord said unto mose go down charg the peopl lest
they break through unto the lord to gaze and mani of them perish

19:22 and let the priest also which come near to the lord sanctifi

19:23 and mose said unto the lord the peopl cannot come up to mount
sinai: for thou chargedst us say set bound about the mount and
sanctifi it

19:24 and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt
come up thou and aaron with thee: but let not the priest and the

26:5 and your thresh shall reach unto the vintag and the vintag
shall reach unto the sow time: and ye shall eat your bread to the

26:6 and i will give peac in the land and ye shall lie down and
none shall make you afraid: and i will rid evil beast out of the
land neither shall the sword go through your land

26:7 and ye shall chase your enemi and they shall fall befor you
by the sword

26:8 and five of you shall chase an hundr and an hundr of you
shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemi shall fall befor
you by the sword

26:9 for i will have respect unto you and make you fruit and
multipli you and establish my coven with you

26:10 and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old becaus of
the new

26:11 and i set my tabernacl among you: and my soul shall not abhor
you

26:12 and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be
my peopl

26:13 i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land
of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen; and i have broken the
band of your yoke and made you go upright

26:14 but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these
commandments; 26:15 and if ye shall despis my statut or if your
soul abhor my judgment so that ye will not do all my command
but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 i also will do thi unto you; i
will even appoint over you terror consumpt and the burn agu
that shall consum the eye and caus sorrow of heart: and ye shall
sow your seed in vain for your enemi shall eat it

26:17 and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain befor
your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall
flee when none pursueth you

26:18 and if ye will not yet for all thi hearken unto me then i will
punish you seven time more for your sin

26:19 and i will break the pride of your power; and i will make your
heaven as iron and your earth as brass: 26:20 and your strength shall
be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increas neither
shall the tree of the land yield their fruit

26:21 and if ye walk contrari unto me and will not hearken unto me; i
will bring seven time more plagu upon you accord to your sin

26:22 i will also send wild beast among you which shall rob you of
your children and destroy your cattl and make you few in number;
and your high way shall be desol

26:23 and if ye will not be reform by me by these thing but will
walk contrari unto me; 26:24 then will i also walk contrari unto you
and will punish you yet seven time for your sin

26:25 and i will bring a sword upon you that shall aveng the quarrel
of my covenant: and when ye are gather togeth within your citi
i will send the pestil among you; and ye shall be deliv into

26:26 and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall
bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliv you your bread
again by weight: and ye shall eat and not be satisfi

26:27 and if ye will not for all thi hearken unto me but walk
contrari unto me; 26:28 then i will walk contrari unto you also in
fury; and i even i will chastis you seven time for your sin

26:29 and ye shall eat the flesh of your son and the flesh of your
daughter shall ye eat

26:30 and i will destroy your high place and cut down your imag
and cast your carcas upon the carcas of your idol and my soul
shall abhor you

26:31 and i will make your citi wast and bring your sanctuari
unto desol and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odour

26:32 and i will bring the land into desolation: and your enemi
which dwell therein shall be astonish at it

26:33 and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a
sword after you: and your land shall be desol and your citi
wast

26:34 then shall the land enjoy her sabbath as long as it lieth
desol and ye be in your enemi land; even then shall the land
rest and enjoy her sabbath

26:35 as long as it lieth desol it shall rest; becaus it did not
rest in your sabbath when ye dwelt upon it

26:36 and upon them that are left aliv of you i will send a faint
into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee as flee from a
sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth

26:37 and they shall fall one upon anoth as it were befor a sword
when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand befor your
enemi

26:38 and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your
enemi shall eat you up

26:39 and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniqu
in your enemi lands; and also in the iniqu of their father
shall they pine away with them

26:40 if they shall confess their iniqu and the iniqu of their
father with their trespass which they trespass against me and
that also they have walk contrari unto me; 26:41 and that i also
have walk contrari unto them and have brought them into the land of
their enemies; if then their uncircumcis heart be humbl and they
then accept of the punish of their iniquity: 26:42 then will i
rememb my coven with jacob and also my coven with isaac and
also my coven with abraham will i remember; and i will rememb the
land

26:43 the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her
sabbath while she lieth desol without them: and they shall accept
of the punish of their iniquity: becaus even becaus they
despis my judgment and becaus their soul abhor my statut

26:44 and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemi
i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them
utterli and to break my coven with them: for i am the lord their
god

26:45 but i will for their sake rememb the coven of their
ancestor whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight
of the heathen that i might be their god: i am the lord

all the next day and they gather the quails: he that gather least
gather ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselv
round about the camp

11:33 and while the flesh wa yet between their teeth ere it wa
chew the wrath of the lord wa kindl against the peopl and the
lord smote the peopl with a veri great plagu

11:34 and he call the name of that place kibrothhattaavah: becaus
there they buri the peopl that lust

11:35 and the peopl journey from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth;
and abod at hazeroth

12:1 and miriam and aaron spake against mose becaus of the ethiopian
woman whom he had married: for he had marri an ethiopian woman

12:2 and they said hath the lord inde spoken onli by moses? hath he
not spoken also by us? and the lord heard it

12:3 (now the man mose wa veri meek abov all the men which were
upon the face of the earth) 12:4 and the lord spake suddenli unto
mose and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the
tabernacl of the congreg and they three came out

12:5 and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in
the door of the tabernacl and call aaron and miriam: and they both
came forth

12:6 and he said hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you
i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak
unto him in a dream

12:7 my servant mose is not so who is faith in all mine hous

12:8 with him will i speak mouth to mouth even appar and not in
dark speeches; and the similitud of the lord shall he behold:
wherefor then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses?
12:9 and the anger of the lord wa kindl against them; and he
depart

12:10 and the cloud depart from off the tabernacle; and behold
miriam becam leprou white as snow: and aaron look upon miriam
and behold she wa leprou

12:11 and aaron said unto mose ala my lord i beseech thee lay
not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishli and wherein we
have sin

12:12 let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consum
when he cometh out of hi mother womb

12:13 and mose cri unto the lord say heal her now o god i
beseech thee

12:14 and the lord said unto mose if her father had but spit in her
face should she not be asham seven days? let her be shut out from
the camp seven day and after that let her be receiv in again

12:15 and miriam wa shut out from the camp seven days: and the peopl
journey not till miriam wa brought in again

12:16 and afterward the peopl remov from hazeroth and pitch in
the wilder of paran

13:1 and the lord spake unto mose say 13:2 send thou men that
they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of
israel: of everi tribe of their father shall ye send a man everi one
a ruler among them

13:3 and mose by the command of the lord sent them from the
wilder of paran: all those men were head of the children of
israel

13:4 and these were their names: of the tribe of reuben shammua the
son of zaccur

13:5 of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori

13:6 of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh

13:7 of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph

13:15 of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi

13:16 these are the name of the men which mose sent to spi out the
land

and mose call oshea the son of nun jehoshua

13:17 and mose sent them to spi out the land of canaan and said unto
them get you up thi way southward and go up into the mountain:
13:18 and see the land what it is and the peopl that dwelleth
therein whether they be strong or weak few or many; 13:19 and what
the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad; and what
citi they be that they dwell in whether in tent or in strong
holds; 13:20 and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether
there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courag and bring of
the fruit of the land now the time wa the time of the firstrip
grape

13:21 so they went up and search the land from the wilder of
zin unto rehob as men come to hamath

13:22 and they ascend by the south and came unto hebron; where
ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were (now hebron
wa built seven year befor zoan in egypt) 13:23 and they came unto
the brook of eshcol and cut down from thenc a branch with one
cluster of grape and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they
brought of the pomegran and of the fig

13:24 the place wa call the brook eshcol becaus of the cluster of
grape which the children of israel cut down from thenc

13:25 and they return from search of the land after forti day

13:26 and they went and came to mose and to aaron and to all the
congreg of the children of israel unto the wilder of paran
to kadesh; and brought back word unto them and unto all the
congreg and shew them the fruit of the land

13:27 and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou
sentest us and sure it floweth with milk and honey; and thi is the
fruit of it

13:28 nevertheless the peopl be strong that dwell in the land and
the citi are wall and veri great: and moreov we saw the
children of anak there

13:29 the amalekit dwell in the land of the south: and the hittit
and the jebusit and the amorit dwell in the mountains: and the
canaanit dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan

13:30 and caleb still the peopl befor mose and said let us go
up at onc and possess it; for we are well abl to overcom it

13:31 but the men that went up with him said we be not abl to go up
against the people; for they are stronger than we

13:32 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
search unto the children of israel say the land through which
we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabit
thereof; and all the peopl that we saw in it are men of a great
statur

13:33 and there we saw the giant the son of anak which come of the
giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshopp and so we were
in their sight

14:1 and all the congreg lift up their voic and cried; and
the peopl wept that night

14:2 and all the children of israel murmur against mose and against
aaron: and the whole congreg said unto them would god that we
had die in the land of egypt! or would god we had die in thi
wilderness! 14:3 and wherefor hath the lord brought us unto thi
land to fall by the sword that our wive and our children should be
a prey? were it not better for us to return into egypt? 14:4 and they
said one to anoth let us make a captain and let us return into
egypt

14:5 then mose and aaron fell on their face befor all the assembl
of the congreg of the children of israel

14:6 and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which
were of them that search the land rent their clothes: 14:7 and they
spake unto all the compani of the children of israel say the
land which we pass through to search it is an exceed good land

14:8 if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into thi land
and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey

14:9 onli rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the peopl of
the land; for they are bread for us: their defenc is depart from
them and the lord is with us: fear them not

14:10 but all the congreg bade stone them with stone and the
glori of the lord appear in the tabernacl of the congreg
befor all the children of israel

14:11 and the lord said unto mose how long will thi peopl provok
me? and how long will it be ere they believ me for all the sign
which i have shew among them? 14:12 i will smite them with the
pestil and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater
nation and mightier than they

14:13 and mose said unto the lord then the egyptian shall hear it
(for thou broughtest up thi peopl in thi might from among them;)
14:14 and they will tell it to the inhabit of thi land: for they
have heard that thou lord art among thi peopl that thou lord art
seen face to face and that thi cloud standeth over them and that
thou goest befor them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a
pillar of fire by night

14:15 now if thou shalt kill all thi peopl as one man then the
nation which have heard the fame of thee will speak say 14:16
becaus the lord wa not abl to bring thi peopl into the land which
he sware unto them therefor he hath slain them in the wilder

14:17 and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great
accord as thou hast spoken say 14:18 the lord is
longsuff and of great merci forgiv iniqu and
transgress and by no mean clear the guilti visit the
iniqu of the father upon the children unto the third and fourth
gener

14:19 pardon i beseech thee the iniqu of thi peopl accord
unto the great of thi merci and as thou hast forgiven thi
peopl from egypt even until now

14:20 and the lord said i have pardon accord to thi word: 14:21
but as truli as i live all the earth shall be fill with the glori
of the lord

14:22 becaus all those men which have seen my glori and my miracl
which i did in egypt and in the wilder and have tempt me now
these ten time and have not hearken to my voice; 14:23 sure they
shall not see the land which i sware unto their father neither shall
ani of them that provok me see it: 14:24 but my servant caleb
becaus he had anoth spirit with him and hath follow me fulli
him will i bring into the land whereinto he went; and hi seed shall
possess it

14:25 (now the amalekit and the canaanit dwelt in the valley)
tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilder by the way of the
red sea

14:26 and the lord spake unto mose and unto aaron say 14:27 how
long shall i bear with thi evil congreg which murmur against
me? i have heard the murmur of the children of israel which they
murmur against me

14:28 say unto them as truli as i live saith the lord as ye have
spoken in mine ear so will i do to you: 14:29 your carcas shall
fall in thi wilderness; and all that were number of you accord
to your whole number from twenti year old and upward which have
murmur against me

14:30 doubtless ye shall not come into the land concern which i
sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and
joshua the son of nun

14:31 but your littl one which ye said should be a prey them will
i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despis

14:32 but as for you your carcas they shall fall in thi
wilder

14:33 and your children shall wander in the wilder forti year
and bear your whoredom until your carcas be wast in the
wilder

14:34 after the number of the day in which ye search the land even
forti day each day for a year shall ye bear your iniqu even
forti year and ye shall know my breach of promis

14:35 i the lord have said i will sure do it unto all thi evil
congreg that are gather togeth against me: in thi
wilder they shall be consum and there they shall die

14:36 and the men which mose sent to search the land who return
and made all the congreg to murmur against him by bring up a
slander upon the land 14:37 even those men that did bring up the evil
report upon the land die by the plagu befor the lord

14:38 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which
were of the men that went to search the land live still

14:39 and mose told these say unto all the children of israel:
and the peopl mourn greatli

14:40 and they rose up earli in the morn and gat them up into the
top of the mountain say lo we be here and will go up unto the
place which the lord hath promised: for we have sin

14:41 and mose said wherefor now do ye transgress the command
of the lord? but it shall not prosper

14:42 go not up for the lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten
befor your enemi

14:43 for the amalekit and the canaanit are there befor you and
ye shall fall by the sword: becaus ye are turn away from the lord
therefor the lord will not be with you

14:44 but they presum to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
ark of the coven of the lord and mose depart not out of the
camp

14:45 then the amalekit came down and the canaanit which dwelt in
that hill and smote them and discomfit them even unto hormah

15:1 and the lord spake unto mose say 15:2 speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land
of your habit which i give unto you 15:3 and will make an
offer by fire unto the lord a burnt offer or a sacrific in
perform a vow or in a freewil offer or in your solemn feast
to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock:
15:4 then shall he that offereth hi offer unto the lord bring a
meat offer of a tenth deal of flour mingl with the fourth part of
an hin of oil

15:5 and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offer shalt
thou prepar with the burnt offer or sacrific for one lamb

15:6 or for a ram thou shalt prepar for a meat offer two tenth
deal of flour mingl with the third part of an hin of oil

15:7 and for a drink offer thou shalt offer the third part of an
hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord

15:8 and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offer or for a
sacrific in perform a vow or peac offer unto the lord: 15:9
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offer of three tenth
deal of flour mingl with half an hin of oil

15:10 and thou shalt bring for a drink offer half an hin of wine
for an offer made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord

15:11 thu shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a
lamb or a kid

15:12 accord to the number that ye shall prepar so shall ye do to
everi one accord to their number

15:13 all that are born of the countri shall do these thing after
thi manner in offer an offer made by fire of a sweet savour
unto the lord

15:14 and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoev be among you in
your gener and will offer an offer made by fire of a sweet
savour unto the lord; as ye do so he shall do

15:15 one ordin shall be both for you of the congreg and
also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordin for ever
in your generations: as ye are so shall the stranger be befor the
lord

15:16 one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger
that sojourneth with you

15:17 and the lord spake unto mose say 15:18 speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land
whither i bring you 15:19 then it shall be that when ye eat of the
bread of the land ye shall offer up an heav offer unto the lord

15:20 ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heav
offering: as ye do the heav offer of the threshingfloor so shall
ye heav it

15:21 of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heav
offer in your gener

15:22 and if ye have er and not observ all these command
which the lord hath spoken unto mose 15:23 even all that the lord
hath command you by the hand of mose from the day that the lord
command mose and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 then
it shall be if ought be commit by ignor without the knowledg
of the congreg that all the congreg shall offer one young
bullock for a burnt offer for a sweet savour unto the lord with
hi meat offer and hi drink offer accord to the manner
and one kid of the goat for a sin offer

15:25 and the priest shall make an aton for all the congreg
of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them; for it is
ignorance: and they shall bring their offer a sacrific made by
fire unto the lord and their sin offer befor the lord for their
ignorance: 15:26 and it shall be forgiven all the congreg of the
children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them;
see all the peopl were in ignor

15:27 and if ani soul sin through ignor then he shall bring a she
goat of the first year for a sin offer

15:28 and the priest shall make an aton for the soul that sinneth
ignorantli when he sinneth by ignor befor the lord to make an
aton for him; and it shall be forgiven him

15:29 ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignor
both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the
stranger that sojourneth among them

15:30 but the soul that doeth ought presumptu whether he be born
in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord; and that
soul shall be cut off from among hi peopl

15:31 becaus he hath despis the word of the lord and hath broken
hi command that soul shall utterli be cut off; hi iniqu
shall be upon him

15:32 and while the children of israel were in the wilder they
found a man that gather stick upon the sabbath day

15:33 and they that found him gather stick brought him unto mose
and aaron and unto all the congreg

15:34 and they put him in ward becaus it wa not declar what
should be done to him

15:35 and the lord said unto mose the man shall be sure put to
death: all the congreg shall stone him with stone without the
camp

15:36 and all the congreg brought him without the camp and
stone him with stone and he died; as the lord command mose

15:37 and the lord spake unto mose say 15:38 speak unto the
children of israel and bid them that they make them fring in the
border of their garment throughout their gener and that they
put upon the fring of the border a ribband of blue: 15:39 and it
shall be unto you for a fring that ye may look upon it and rememb
all the command of the lord and do them; and that ye seek not
after your own heart and your own eye after which ye use to go a
whoring: 15:40 that ye may rememb and do all my command and
be holi unto your god

15:41 i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of
egypt to be your god: i am the lord your god

16:1 now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi
and dathan and abiram the son of eliab and on the son of peleth
son of reuben took men: 16:2 and they rose up befor mose with
certain of the children of israel two hundr and fifti princ of
the assembl famou in the congreg men of renown: 16:3 and they
gather themselv togeth against mose and against aaron and said
unto them ye take too much upon you see all the congreg are
holi everi one of them and the lord is among them: wherefor then
lift ye up yourselv abov the congreg of the lord? 16:4 and
when mose heard it he fell upon hi face: 16:5 and he spake unto
korah and unto all hi compani say even to morrow the lord will
shew who are hi and who is holy; and will caus him to come near
unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he caus to come near unto
him

16:6 thi do; take you censer korah and all hi company; 16:7 and
put fire therein and put incens in them befor the lord to morrow:
and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choos he shall be
holy: ye take too much upon you ye son of levi

16:8 and mose said unto korah hear i pray you ye son of levi:
16:9 seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel
hath separ you from the congreg of israel to bring you near
to himself to do the servic of the tabernacl of the lord and to
stand befor the congreg to minist unto them? 16:10 and he
hath brought thee near to him and all thi brethren the son of levi
with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 16:11 for which caus
both thou and all thi compani are gather togeth against the lord:
and what is aaron that ye murmur against him? 16:12 and mose sent
to call dathan and abiram the son of eliab: which said we will not
come up: 16:13 is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of
a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilder
except thou make thyself altogeth a princ over us? 16:14 moreov
thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey
or given us inherit of field and vineyards: wilt thou put out the
eye of these men? we will not come up

16:15 and mose wa veri wroth and said unto the lord respect not
thou their offering: i have not taken one ass from them neither have
i hurt one of them

16:16 and mose said unto korah be thou and all thi compani befor
the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow: 16:17 and take everi
man hi censer and put incens in them and bring ye befor the lord
everi man hi censer two hundr and fifti censers; thou also and
aaron each of you hi censer

16:18 and they took everi man hi censer and put fire in them and
laid incens thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacl of the
congreg with mose and aaron

16:19 and korah gather all the congreg against them unto the
door of the tabernacl of the congregation: and the glori of the lord
appear unto all the congreg

16:20 and the lord spake unto mose and unto aaron say 16:21
separ yourselv from among thi congreg that i may consum
them in a moment

16:22 and they fell upon their face and said o god the god of the
spirit of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with
all the congregation? 16:23 and the lord spake unto mose say
16:24 speak unto the congreg say get you up from about the
tabernacl of korah dathan and abiram

16:25 and mose rose up and went unto dathan and abiram; and the
elder of israel follow him

16:26 and he spake unto the congreg say depart i pray you
from the tent of these wick men and touch noth of their lest
ye be consum in all their sin

16:27 so they gat up from the tabernacl of korah dathan and abiram
on everi side: and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door
of their tent and their wive and their son and their littl
children

16:28 and mose said herebi ye shall know that the lord hath sent me
to do all these works; for i have not done them of mine own mind

16:29 if these men die the common death of all men or if they be
visit after the visit of all men; then the lord hath not sent
me

16:30 but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth
and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go
down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have
provok the lord

16:31 and it came to pass as he had made an end of speak all these
word that the ground clave asund that wa under them: 16:32 and
the earth open her mouth and swallow them up and their hous
and all the men that appertain unto korah and all their good

16:33 they and all that appertain to them went down aliv into the
pit and the earth close upon them: and they perish from among the
congreg

16:34 and all israel that were round about them fled at the cri of
them: for they said lest the earth swallow us up also

16:35 and there came out a fire from the lord and consum the two
hundr and fifti men that offer incens

16:36 and the lord spake unto mose say 16:37 speak unto eleazar
the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censer out of the
burn and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallow

16:38 the censer of these sinner against their own soul let them
make them broad plate for a cover of the altar: for they offer
them befor the lord therefor they are hallowed: and they shall be a
sign unto the children of israel

16:39 and eleazar the priest took the brasen censer wherewith they
that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plate for a
cover of the altar: 16:40 to be a memori unto the children of
israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near
to offer incens befor the lord; that he be not as korah and as hi
company: as the lord said to him by the hand of mose

16:41 but on the morrow all the congreg of the children of israel

peopl of the lord

16:42 and it came to pass when the congreg wa gather against
mose and against aaron that they look toward the tabernacl of the
congregation: and behold the cloud cover it and the glori of the
lord appear

16:43 and mose and aaron came befor the tabernacl of the
congreg

16:44 and the lord spake unto mose say 16:45 get you up from
among thi congreg that i may consum them as in a moment and
they fell upon their face

16:46 and mose said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein
from off the altar and put on incens and go quickli unto the
congreg and make an aton for them: for there is wrath gone
out from the lord; the plagu is begun

16:47 and aaron took as mose command and ran into the midst of the
congregation; and behold the plagu wa begun among the people: and
he put on incens and made an aton for the peopl

16:48 and he stood between the dead and the living; and the plagu wa
stay

16:49 now they that die in the plagu were fourteen thousand and
seven hundr besid them that die about the matter of korah

16:50 and aaron return unto mose unto the door of the tabernacl of
the congregation: and the plagu wa stay

17:1 and the lord spake unto mose say 17:2 speak unto the
children of israel and take of everi one of them a rod accord to
the hous of their father of all their princ accord to the
hous of their father twelv rods: write thou everi man name upon
hi rod

17:3 and thou shalt write aaron name upon the rod of levi: for one
rod shall be for the head of the hous of their father

17:4 and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacl of the congreg
befor the testimoni where i will meet with you

17:5 and it shall come to pass that the man rod whom i shall
choos shall blossom: and i will make to ceas from me the murmur
of the children of israel wherebi they murmur against you

17:6 and mose spake unto the children of israel and everi one of
their princ gave him a rod apiec for each princ one accord to
their father hous even twelv rods: and the rod of aaron wa
among their rod

17:7 and mose laid up the rod befor the lord in the tabernacl of

17:8 and it came to pass that on the morrow mose went into the
tabernacl of witness; and behold the rod of aaron for the hous of
levi wa bud and brought forth bud and bloom blossom and
yield almond

17:9 and mose brought out all the rod from befor the lord unto all
the children of israel: and they look and took everi man hi rod

17:10 and the lord said unto mose bring aaron rod again befor the
testimoni to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
quit take away their murmur from me that they die not

17:11 and mose did so: as the lord command him so did he

17:12 and the children of israel spake unto mose say behold we
die we perish we all perish

17:13 whosoev cometh ani thing near unto the tabernacl of the lord
shall die: shall we be consum with dying? 18:1 and the lord said
unto aaron thou and thi son and thi father hous with thee shall
bear the iniqu of the sanctuary: and thou and thi son with thee
shall bear the iniqu of your priesthood

18:2 and thi brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thi
father bring thou with thee that they may be join unto thee and
minist unto thee: but thou and thi son with thee shall minist
befor the tabernacl of wit

18:3 and they shall keep thi charg and the charg of all the
tabernacle: onli they shall not come nigh the vessel of the sanctuari
and the altar that neither they nor ye also die

18:4 and they shall be join unto thee and keep the charg of the
tabernacl of the congreg for all the servic of the tabernacle:
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you

18:5 and ye shall keep the charg of the sanctuari and the charg of
the altar: that there be no wrath ani more upon the children of
israel

18:6 and i behold i have taken your brethren the levit from among
the children of israel: to you they are given as a gift for the lord
to do the servic of the tabernacl of the congreg

18:7 therefor thou and thi son with thee shall keep your priest
offic for everyth of the altar and within the vail; and ye shall

18:16 and those that are to be redeem from a month old shalt thou

18:17 but the firstl of a cow or the firstl of a sheep or the

18:20 and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inherit in

and thine inherit among the children of israel

18:21 and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in
israel for an inherit for their servic which they serv even
the servic of the tabernacl of the congreg

18:22 neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the
tabernacl of the congreg lest they bear sin and die

18:23 but the levit shall do the servic of the tabernacl of the
congreg and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a
statut for ever throughout your gener that among the children
of israel they have no inherit

18:24 but the tith of the children of israel which they offer as an
heav offer unto the lord i have given to the levit to inherit:
therefor i have said unto them among the children of israel they
shall have no inherit

18:25 and the lord spake unto mose say 18:26 thu speak unto the
levit and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the
tith which i have given you from them for your inherit then ye
shall offer up an heav offer of it for the lord even a tenth part

18:28 thu ye also shall offer an heav offer unto the lord of all

18:31 and ye shall eat it in everi place ye and your households: for
it is your reward for your servic in the tabernacl of the
congreg

18:32 and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heav
from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollut the holi thing of
the children of israel lest ye die

19:1 and the lord spake unto mose and unto aaron say 19:2 thi
is the ordin of the law which the lord hath command say
speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer
without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke:
19:3 and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring
her forth without the camp and one shall slay her befor hi face:
19:4 and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with hi finger
and sprinkl of her blood directli befor the tabernacl of the
congreg seven times: 19:5 and one shall burn the heifer in hi
sight; her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he
burn: 19:6 and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and
scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burn of the heifer

19:7 then the priest shall wash hi cloth and he shall bath hi
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the
priest shall be unclean until the even

19:8 and he that burneth her shall wash hi cloth in water and
bath hi flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even

19:9 and a man that is clean shall gather up the ash of the heifer
and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be
kept for the congreg of the children of israel for a water of
separation: it is a purif for sin

19:10 and he that gathereth the ash of the heifer shall wash hi
cloth and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the
children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them
for a statut for ever

19:11 he that toucheth the dead bodi of ani man shall be unclean seven
day

19:12 he shall purifi himself with it on the third day and on the
seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purifi not himself the third
day then the seventh day he shall not be clean

19:13 whosoev toucheth the dead bodi of ani man that is dead and
purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacl of the lord; and that
soul shall be cut off from israel: becaus the water of separ wa
not sprinkl upon him he shall be unclean; hi unclean is yet
upon him

19:14 thi is the law when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into
the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven day

19:15 and everi open vessel which hath no cover bound upon it is
unclean

19:16 and whosoev toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
open field or a dead bodi or a bone of a man or a grave shall be

19:17 and for an unclean person they shall take of the ash of the

clean person shall sprinkl upon the unclean on the third day and on
the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purifi himself and
wash hi cloth and bath himself in water and shall be clean at
even

19:20 but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purifi himself
that soul shall be cut off from among the congreg becaus he
hath defil the sanctuari of the lord: the water of separ hath
not been sprinkl upon him; he is unclean

19:21 and it shall be a perpetu statut unto them that he that
sprinkleth the water of separ shall wash hi clothes; and he that
toucheth the water of separ shall be unclean until even

19:22 and whatsoev the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even

20:1 then came the children of israel even the whole congreg
into the desert of zin in the first month: and the peopl abod in
kadesh; and miriam die there and wa buri there

20:2 and there wa no water for the congregation: and they gather
themselv togeth against mose and against aaron

20:3 and the peopl chode with mose and spake say would god
that we had die when our brethren die befor the lord! 20:4 and whi
have ye brought up the congreg of the lord into thi wilder
that we and our cattl should die there? 20:5 and wherefor have ye
made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto thi evil place?
it is no place of seed or of fig or of vine or of pomegranates;
neither is there ani water to drink

20:6 and mose and aaron went from the presenc of the assembl unto
the door of the tabernacl of the congreg and they fell upon
their faces: and the glori of the lord appear unto them

20:7 and the lord spake unto mose say 20:8 take the rod and
gather thou the assembl togeth thou and aaron thi brother and
speak ye unto the rock befor their eyes; and it shall give forth hi
water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so
thou shalt give the congreg and their beast drink

20:9 and mose took the rod from befor the lord as he command him

20:10 and mose and aaron gather the congreg togeth befor
the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels; must we fetch
you water out of thi rock? 20:11 and mose lift up hi hand and
with hi rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out
abundantli and the congreg drank and their beast also

20:12 and the lord spake unto mose and aaron becaus ye believ me
not to sanctifi me in the eye of the children of israel therefor
ye shall not bring thi congreg into the land which i have given
them

20:13 thi is the water of meribah; becaus the children of israel
strove with the lord and he wa sanctifi in them

20:14 and mose sent messeng from kadesh unto the king of edom
thu saith thi brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us: 20:15 how our father went down into egypt and we have
dwelt in egypt a long time; and the egyptian vex us and our
fathers: 20:16 and when we cri unto the lord he heard our voic
and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt: and
behold we are in kadesh a citi in the uttermost of thi border: 20:17
let us pass i pray thee through thi country: we will not pass
through the field or through the vineyard neither will we drink of
the water of the wells: we will go by the king high way we will not
turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have pass thi
border

20:18 and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come
out against thee with the sword

20:19 and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high
way: and if i and my cattl drink of thi water then i will pay for
it: i will onli without do anyth els go through on my feet

20:20 and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out
against him with much peopl and with a strong hand

20:21 thu edom refus to give israel passag through hi border:
wherefor israel turn away from him

20:22 and the children of israel even the whole congreg
journey from kadesh and came unto mount hor

20:23 and the lord spake unto mose and aaron in mount hor by the
coast of the land of edom say 20:24 aaron shall be gather unto
hi people: for he shall not enter into the land which i have given
unto the children of israel becaus ye rebel against my word at
the water of meribah

20:25 take aaron and eleazar hi son and bring them up unto mount
hor: 20:26 and strip aaron of hi garment and put them upon eleazar
hi son: and aaron shall be gather unto hi peopl and shall die
there

20:27 and mose did as the lord commanded: and they went up into mount
hor in the sight of all the congreg

20:28 and mose strip aaron of hi garment and put them upon
eleazar hi son; and aaron die there in the top of the mount: and
mose and eleazar came down from the mount

20:29 and when all the congreg saw that aaron wa dead they
mourn for aaron thirti day even all the hous of israel

21:1 and when king arad the canaanit which dwelt in the south heard
tell that israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
israel and took some of them prison

21:2 and israel vow a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt
inde deliv thi peopl into my hand then i will utterli destroy
their citi

21:3 and the lord hearken to the voic of israel and deliv up
the canaanites; and they utterli destroy them and their cities: and
he call the name of the place hormah

21:4 and they journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea to
compass the land of edom: and the soul of the peopl wa much
discourag becaus of the way

21:5 and the peopl spake against god and against mose wherefor
have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness? for there
is no bread neither is there ani water; and our soul loatheth thi
light bread

21:6 and the lord sent fieri serpent among the peopl and they bit
the people; and much peopl of israel die

21:7 therefor the peopl came to mose and said we have sin for
we have spoken against the lord and against thee; pray unto the lord
that he take away the serpent from us and mose pray for the
peopl

21:8 and the lord said unto mose make thee a fieri serpent and set
it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass that everi one that is
bitten when he looketh upon it shall live

21:9 and mose made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it
came to pass that if a serpent had bitten ani man when he beheld the
serpent of brass he live

21:10 and the children of israel set forward and pitch in oboth

21:11 and they journey from oboth and pitch at ijeabarim in the
wilder which is befor moab toward the sunris

21:12 from thenc they remov and pitch in the valley of zare

21:13 from thenc they remov and pitch on the other side of
arnon which is in the wilder that cometh out of the coast of the
amorites: for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the
amorit

21:14 wherefor it is said in the book of the war of the lord what
he did in the red sea and in the brook of arnon 21:15 and at the
stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwell of ar and lieth
upon the border of moab

21:16 and from thenc they went to beer: that is the well whereof the
lord spake unto mose gather the peopl togeth and i will give
them water

21:17 then israel sang thi song spring up o well; sing ye unto it:
21:18 the princ dig the well the nobl of the peopl dig it
by the direct of the lawgiv with their stave and from the
wilder they went to mattanah: 21:19 and from mattanah to nahaliel:
and from nahaliel to bamoth: 21:20 and from bamoth in the valley that
is in the countri of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward
jeshimon

21:21 and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit
say 21:22 let me pass through thi land: we will not turn into the
field or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the water of the
well: but we will go along by the king high way until we be past
thi border

21:23 and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through hi border:
but sihon gather all hi peopl togeth and went out against
israel into the wilderness: and he came to jahaz and fought against
israel

21:24 and israel smote him with the edg of the sword and possess
hi land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon: for
the border of the children of ammon wa strong

21:25 and israel took all these cities: and israel dwelt in all the
citi of the amorit in heshbon and in all the villag thereof

21:26 for heshbon wa the citi of sihon the king of the amorit who
had fought against the former king of moab and taken all hi land out
of hi hand even unto arnon

21:27 wherefor they that speak in proverb say come into heshbon
let the citi of sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 for there is a fire
gone out of heshbon a flame from the citi of sihon: it hath consum
ar of moab and the lord of the high place of arnon

21:29 woe to thee moab! thou art undon o peopl of chemosh: he hath
given hi son that escap and hi daughter into captiv unto
sihon king of the amorit

21:30 we have shot at them; heshbon is perish even unto dibon and
we have laid them wast even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba

21:31 thu israel dwelt in the land of the amorit

21:32 and mose sent to spi out jaazer and they took the villag
thereof and drove out the amorit that were there

21:33 and they turn and went up by the way of bashan: and og the
king of bashan went out against them he and all hi peopl to the
battl at edrei

21:34 and the lord said unto mose fear him not: for i have deliv
him into thi hand and all hi peopl and hi land; and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorit which dwelt at
heshbon

21:35 so they smote him and hi son and all hi peopl until there
wa none left him alive: and they possess hi land

22:1 and the children of israel set forward and pitch in the plain
of moab on thi side jordan by jericho

22:2 and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the
amorit

22:3 and moab wa sore afraid of the peopl becaus they were many:
and moab wa distress becaus of the children of israel

22:4 and moab said unto the elder of midian now shall thi compani
lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field

and balak the son of zippor wa king of the moabit at that time

22:5 he sent messeng therefor unto balaam the son of beor to
pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of hi
peopl to call him say behold there is a peopl come out from
egypt: behold they cover the face of the earth and they abid over
against me: 22:6 come now therefor i pray thee curs me thi
people; for they are too mighti for me: peradventur i shall prevail
that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land: for
i wot that he whom thou blessest is bless and he whom thou cursest
is curs

22:7 and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the
reward of divin in their hand; and they came unto balaam and
spake unto him the word of balak

22:8 and he said unto them lodg here thi night and i will bring
you word again as the lord shall speak unto me: and the princ of
moab abod with balaam

22:9 and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee?
22:10 and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab
hath sent unto me say 22:11 behold there is a peopl come out of
egypt which covereth the face of the earth: come now curs me them;
peradventur i shall be abl to overcom them and drive them out

22:12 and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them; thou
shalt not curs the people: for they are bless

22:13 and balaam rose up in the morn and said unto the princ of
balak get you into your land: for the lord refuseth to give me leav
to go with you

22:14 and the princ of moab rose up and they went unto balak and
said balaam refuseth to come with us

22:15 and balak sent yet again princ more and more honour than
they

22:16 and they came to balaam and said to him thu saith balak the
son of zippor let noth i pray thee hinder thee from come unto
me: 22:17 for i will promot thee unto veri great honour and i will
do whatsoev thou sayest unto me: come therefor i pray thee curs
me thi peopl

22:18 and balaam answer and said unto the servant of balak if
balak would give me hi hous full of silver and gold i cannot go
beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more

22:19 now therefor i pray you tarri ye also here thi night that i
may know what the lord will say unto me more

22:20 and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men
come to call thee rise up and go with them; but yet the word which i
shall say unto thee that shalt thou do

22:21 and balaam rose up in the morn and saddl hi ass and went
with the princ of moab

22:22 and god anger wa kindl becaus he went: and the angel of
the lord stood in the way for an adversari against him now he wa
ride upon hi ass and hi two servant were with him

22:23 and the ass saw the angel of the lord stand in the way and
hi sword drawn in hi hand: and the ass turn asid out of the way
and went into the field: and balaam smote the ass to turn her into
the way

22:24 but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyard a
wall be on thi side and a wall on that side

22:25 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself
unto the wall and crush balaam foot against the wall: and he
smote her again

22:26 and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow
place where wa no way to turn either to the right hand or to the
left

22:27 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under
balaam: and balaam anger wa kindl and he smote the ass with a
staff

22:28 and the lord open the mouth of the ass and she said unto
balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these
three times? 22:29 and balaam said unto the ass becaus thou hast
mock me: i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i
kill thee

22:30 and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which
thou hast ridden ever sinc i wa thine unto thi day? wa i ever wont
to do so unto thee? and he said nay

22:31 then the lord open the eye of balaam and he saw the angel of
the lord stand in the way and hi sword drawn in hi hand: and he
bow down hi head and fell flat on hi face

22:32 and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefor hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times? behold i went out to withstand
thee becaus thi way is pervers befor me: 22:33 and the ass saw me
and turn from me these three times: unless she had turn from me
sure now also i had slain thee and save her aliv

22:34 and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned; for i
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefor if
it displeas thee i will get me back again

22:35 and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men: but

balaam went with the princ of balak

22:36 and when balak heard that balaam wa come he went out to meet

the utmost coast

22:37 and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestli send unto thee

23:1 and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altar and
prepar me here seven oxen and seven ram

23:2 and balak did as balaam had spoken; and balak and balaam offer

alon and shall not be reckon among the nation

23:10 who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth
part of israel? let me die the death of the righteou and let my last
end be like his! 23:11 and balak said unto balaam what hast thou
done unto me? i took thee to curs mine enemi and behold thou
hast bless them altogeth

23:12 and he answer and said must i not take heed to speak that

see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not
see them all: and curs me them from thenc

23:14 and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of

balak and hear; hearken unto me thou son of zippor: 23:19 god is not
a man that he should lie; neither the son of man that he should
repent: hath he said and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken and
shall he not make it good? 23:20 behold i have receiv command
to bless: and he hath blessed; and i cannot revers it

23:21 he hath not beheld iniqu in jacob neither hath he seen

blood of the slain

23:25 and balak said unto balaam neither curs them at all nor bless
them at all

23:26 but balaam answer and said unto balak told not i thee

35:18 or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may
die and he die he is a murderer: the murder shall sure be put to
death

35:19 the reveng of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
meeteth him he shall slay him

35:20 but if he thrust him of hatr or hurl at him by lay of
wait that he die; 35:21 or in enmiti smite him with hi hand that he
die: he that smote him shall sure be put to death; for he is a
murderer: the reveng of blood shall slay the murder when he
meeteth him

35:22 but if he thrust him suddenli without enmiti or have cast upon

command my lord to give the land for an inherit by lot to the
children of israel: and my lord wa command by the lord to give the
inherit of zelophehad our brother unto hi daughter

36:3 and if they be marri to ani of the son of the other tribe of
the children of israel then shall their inherit be taken from the
inherit of our father and shall be put to the inherit of the
tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot
of our inherit

36:4 and when the jubil of the children of israel shall be then
shall their inherit be put unto the inherit of the tribe
whereunto they are received: so shall their inherit be taken away
from the inherit of the tribe of our father

36:5 and mose command the children of israel accord to the word
of the lord say the tribe of the son of joseph hath said well

36:6 thi is the thing which the lord doth command concern the
daughter of zelophehad say let them marri to whom they think
best; onli to the famili of the tribe of their father shall they
marri

36:7 so shall not the inherit of the children of israel remov
from tribe to tribe: for everi one of the children of israel shall
keep himself to the inherit of the tribe of hi father

36:8 and everi daughter that possesseth an inherit in ani tribe
of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the famili of the
tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy everi man
the inherit of hi father

36:9 neither shall the inherit remov from one tribe to anoth
tribe; but everi one of the tribe of the children of israel shall
keep himself to hi own inherit

36:10 even as the lord command mose so did the daughter of
zelophehad: 36:11 for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and
noah the daughter of zelophehad were marri unto their father
brother sons: 36:12 and they were marri into the famili of the
son of manasseh the son of joseph and their inherit remain in
the tribe of the famili of their father

36:13 these are the command and the judgment which the lord
command by the hand of mose unto the children of israel in the
plain of moab by jordan near jericho




the fifth book of moses: call deuteronomi


1:1 these be the word which mose spake unto all israel on thi side
jordan in the wilder in the plain over against the red sea
between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab

1:2 (there are eleven day journey from horeb by the way of mount
seir unto kadeshbarnea) 1:3 and it came to pass in the fortieth
year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that mose
spake unto the children of israel accord unto all that the lord
had given him in command unto them; 1:4 after he had slain sihon
the king of the amorit which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of
bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei: 1:5 on thi side jordan in
the land of moab began mose to declar thi law say 1:6 the
lord our god spake unto us in horeb say ye have dwelt long enough
in thi mount: 1:7 turn you and take your journey and go to the
mount of the amorit and unto all the place nigh thereunto in the
plain in the hill and in the vale and in the south and by the sea
side to the land of the canaanit and unto lebanon unto the great
river the river euphrat

1:8 behold i have set the land befor you: go in and possess the land
which the lord sware unto your father abraham isaac and jacob to
give unto them and to their seed after them

1:9 and i spake unto you at that time say i am not abl to bear
you myself alone: 1:10 the lord your god hath multipli you and
behold ye are thi day as the star of heaven for multitud

1:11 (the lord god of your father make you a thousand time so mani
more as ye are and bless you as he hath promis you!) 1:12 how can
i myself alon bear your cumbranc and your burden and your strife?
1:13 take you wise men and understand and known among your
tribe and i will make them ruler over you

1:14 and ye answer me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is
good for us to do

1:15 so i took the chief of your tribe wise men and known and made
them head over you captain over thousand and captain over
hundr and captain over fifti and captain over ten and
offic among your tribe

1:16 and i charg your judg at that time say hear the caus
between your brethren and judg righteous between everi man and hi
brother and the stranger that is with him

1:17 ye shall not respect person in judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
for the judgment is gods: and the caus that is too hard for you
bring it unto me and i will hear it

1:18 and i command you at that time all the thing which ye should
do

1:19 and when we depart from horeb we went through all that great
and terribl wilder which ye saw by the way of the mountain of
the amorit as the lord our god command us; and we came to
kadeshbarnea

1:20 and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the
amorit which the lord our god doth give unto us

1:21 behold the lord thi god hath set the land befor thee: go up and
possess it as the lord god of thi father hath said unto thee; fear
not neither be discourag

1:22 and ye came near unto me everi one of you and said we will send
men befor us and they shall search us out the land and bring us
word again by what way we must go up and into what citi we shall
come

1:23 and the say pleas me well: and i took twelv men of you one
of a tribe: 1:24 and they turn and went up into the mountain and
came unto the valley of eshcol and search it out

1:25 and they took of the fruit of the land in their hand and
brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a
good land which the lord our god doth give us

1:26 notwithstand ye would not go up but rebel against the
command of the lord your god: 1:27 and ye murmur in your tent
and said becaus the lord hate us he hath brought us forth out of
the land of egypt to deliv us into the hand of the amorit to
destroy us

1:28 whither shall we go up? our brethren have discourag our heart
say the peopl is greater and taller than we; the citi are great
and wall up to heaven; and moreov we have seen the son of the
anakim there

1:29 then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them

1:30 the lord your god which goeth befor you he shall fight for you
accord to all that he did for you in egypt befor your eyes; 1:31
and in the wilder where thou hast seen how that the lord thi god
bare thee as a man doth bear hi son in all the way that ye went
until ye came into thi place

1:32 yet in thi thing ye did not believ the lord your god 1:33 who
went in the way befor you to search you out a place to pitch your
tent in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and
in a cloud by day

1:34 and the lord heard the voic of your word and wa wroth and
sware say 1:35 sure there shall not one of these men of thi
evil gener see that good land which i sware to give unto your
father

1:36 save caleb the son of jephunneh; he shall see it and to him will
i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to hi children
becaus he hath wholli follow the lord

1:37 also the lord wa angri with me for your sake say thou also
shalt not go in thither

1:38 but joshua the son of nun which standeth befor thee he shall
go in thither: encourag him: for he shall caus israel to inherit it

1:39 moreov your littl one which ye said should be a prey and
your children which in that day had no knowledg between good and
evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they
shall possess it

1:40 but as for you turn you and take your journey into the
wilder by the way of the red sea

1:41 then ye answer and said unto me we have sin against the
lord we will go up and fight accord to all that the lord our god
command us

and when ye had gird on everi man hi weapon of war ye were readi
to go up into the hill

1:42 and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither
fight; for i am not among you; lest ye be smitten befor your enemi

1:43 so i spake unto you; and ye would not hear but rebel against
the command of the lord and went presumptu up into the hill

1:44 and the amorit which dwelt in that mountain came out against
you and chase you as bee do and destroy you in seir even unto
hormah

1:45 and ye return and wept befor the lord; but the lord would not
hearken to your voic nor give ear unto you

1:46 so ye abod in kadesh mani day accord unto the day that ye
abod there

2:1 then we turn and took our journey into the wilder by the
way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me: and we compass mount
seir mani day

2:2 and the lord spake unto me say 2:3 ye have compass thi
mountain long enough: turn you northward

2:4 and command thou the peopl say ye are to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselv
therefore: 2:5 meddl not with them; for i will not give you of their
land no not so much as a foot breadth; becaus i have given mount
seir unto esau for a possess

2:6 ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat; and ye shall
also buy water of them for money that ye may drink

2:7 for the lord thi god hath bless thee in all the work of thi
hand: he knoweth thi walk through thi great wilderness: these
forti year the lord thi god hath been with thee; thou hast lack
noth

2:8 and when we pass by from our brethren the children of esau
which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from
eziongab we turn and pass by the way of the wilder of moab

2:9 and the lord said unto me distress not the moabit neither
contend with them in battle: for i will not give thee of their land
for a possession; becaus i have given ar unto the children of lot for
a possess

2:10 the emim dwelt therein in time past a peopl great and mani
and tall as the anakims; 2:11 which also were account giant as
the anakims; but the moabit call them emim

2:12 the horim also dwelt in seir beforetime; but the children of
esau succeed them when they had destroy them from befor them
and dwelt in their stead; as israel did unto the land of hi
possess which the lord gave unto them

2:13 now rise up said i and get you over the brook zere and we
went over the brook zere

2:14 and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were
come over the brook zere wa thirti and eight years; until all the
gener of the men of war were wast out from among the host as
the lord sware unto them

2:15 for inde the hand of the lord wa against them to destroy them
from among the host until they were consum

2:16 so it came to pass when all the men of war were consum and
dead from among the peopl 2:17 that the lord spake unto me say
2:18 thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab thi day:
2:19 and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon
distress them not nor meddl with them: for i will not give thee of
the land of the children of ammon ani possession; becaus i have given
it unto the children of lot for a possess

2:20 (that also wa account a land of giants: giant dwelt therein
in old time; and the ammonit call them zamzummims; 2:21 a peopl
great and mani and tall as the anakims; but the lord destroy them
befor them; and they succeed them and dwelt in their stead: 2:22
as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he
destroy the horim from befor them; and they succeed them and
dwelt in their stead even unto thi day: 2:23 and the avim which
dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorim which came forth
out of caphtor destroy them and dwelt in their stead) 2:24 rise
ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon: behold i
have given into thine hand sihon the amorit king of heshbon and hi
land: begin to possess it and contend with him in battl

2:25 thi day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nation that are under the whole heaven who shall hear
report of thee and shall trembl and be in anguish becaus of thee

2:26 and i sent messeng out of the wilder of kedemoth unto
sihon king of heshbon with word of peac say 2:27 let me pass
through thi land: i will go along by the high way i will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left

2:28 thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat; and give me
water for money that i may drink: onli i will pass through on my
feet; 2:29 (a the children of esau which dwell in seir and the
moabit which dwell in ar did unto me;) until i shall pass over
jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us

2:30 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the
lord thi god harden hi spirit and made hi heart obstin that
he might deliv him into thi hand as appeareth thi day

2:31 and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and
hi land befor thee: begin to possess that thou mayest inherit hi
land

2:32 then sihon came out against us he and all hi peopl to fight
at jahaz

2:33 and the lord our god deliv him befor us; and we smote him
and hi son and all hi peopl

2:34 and we took all hi citi at that time and utterli destroy
the men and the women and the littl one of everi citi we left
none to remain: 2:35 onli the cattl we took for a prey unto
ourselv and the spoil of the citi which we took

2:36 from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from
the citi that is by the river even unto gilead there wa not one
citi too strong for us: the lord our god deliv all unto us: 2:37
onli unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto
ani place of the river jabbok nor unto the citi in the mountain
nor unto whatsoev the lord our god forbad us

3:1 then we turn and went up the way to bashan: and og the king of
bashan came out against us he and all hi peopl to battl at edrei

3:2 and the lord said unto me fear him not: for i will deliv him
and all hi peopl and hi land into thi hand; and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorit which dwelt at
heshbon

3:3 so the lord our god deliv into our hand og also the king of
bashan and all hi people: and we smote him until none wa left to
him remain

3:4 and we took all hi citi at that time there wa not a citi
which we took not from them threescor citi all the region of
argob the kingdom of og in bashan

3:5 all these citi were fenc with high wall gate and bars;
besid unwal town a great mani

3:6 and we utterli destroy them as we did unto sihon king of
heshbon utterli destroy the men women and children of everi
citi

3:7 but all the cattl and the spoil of the citi we took for a
prey to ourselv

3:8 and we took at that time out of the hand of the two king of the
amorit the land that wa on thi side jordan from the river of
arnon unto mount hermon; 3:9 (which hermon the sidonian call sirion;
and the amorit call it shenir;) 3:10 all the citi of the plain
and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei citi of the
kingdom of og in bashan

3:11 for onli og king of bashan remain of the remnant of giants;
behold hi bedstead wa a bedstead of iron; is it not in rabbath of
the children of ammon? nine cubit wa the length thereof and four
cubit the breadth of it after the cubit of a man

3:12 and thi land which we possess at that time from aroer which
is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the citi thereof
gave i unto the reubenit and to the gadit

3:13 and the rest of gilead and all bashan be the kingdom of og
gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh; all the region of argob with
all bashan which wa call the land of giant

3:14 jair the son of manasseh took all the countri of argob unto the
coast of geshuri and maachathi; and call them after hi own name
bashanhavothjair unto thi day

3:15 and i gave gilead unto machir

3:16 and unto the reubenit and unto the gadit i gave from gilead
even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto
the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon; 3:17
the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah
eastward

3:18 and i command you at that time say the lord your god hath
given you thi land to possess it: ye shall pass over arm befor
your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war

3:19 but your wive and your littl one and your cattl (for i
know that ye have much cattle) shall abid in your citi which i
have given you; 3:20 until the lord have given rest unto your
brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land
which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan: and then shall
ye return everi man unto hi possess which i have given you

3:21 and i command joshua at that time say thine eye have seen
all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings: so shall
the lord do unto all the kingdom whither thou passest

3:22 ye shall not fear them: for the lord your god he shall fight for
you

3:23 and i besought the lord at that time say 3:24 o lord god
thou hast begun to shew thi servant thi great and thi mighti
hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do
accord to thi work and accord to thi might? 3:25 i pray thee
let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that
goodli mountain and lebanon

3:26 but the lord wa wroth with me for your sake and would not hear
me: and the lord said unto me let it suffic thee; speak no more unto
me of thi matter

3:27 get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eye
westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it
with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over thi jordan

3:28 but charg joshua and encourag him and strengthen him: for he
shall go over befor thi peopl and he shall caus them to inherit
the land which thou shalt see

3:29 so we abod in the valley over against bethpeor

4:1 now therefor hearken o israel unto the statut and unto the
judgment which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go
in and possess the land which the lord god of your father giveth you

4:2 ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall
ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the command of the
lord your god which i command you

4:3 your eye have seen what the lord did becaus of baalpeor: for all
the men that follow baalpeor the lord thi god hath destroy them
from among you

4:4 but ye that did cleav unto the lord your god are aliv everi one
of you thi day

4:5 behold i have taught you statut and judgment even as the lord
my god command me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
possess it

4:6 keep therefor and do them; for thi is your wisdom and your
understand in the sight of the nation which shall hear all these
statut and say sure thi great nation is a wise and
understand peopl

4:7 for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them
as the lord our god is in all thing that we call upon him for? 4:8
and what nation is there so great that hath statut and judgment so
righteou as all thi law which i set befor you thi day? 4:9 onli
take heed to thyself and keep thi soul dilig lest thou forget
the thing which thine eye have seen and lest they depart from thi
heart all the day of thi life: but teach them thi son and thi son
sons; 4:10 special the day that thou stoodest befor the lord thi
god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the peopl
togeth and i will make them hear my word that they may learn to
fear me all the day that they shall live upon the earth and that
they may teach their children

4:11 and ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
burn with fire unto the midst of heaven with dark cloud and
thick dark

4:12 and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
heard the voic of the word but saw no similitude; onli ye heard a
voic

4:13 and he declar unto you hi coven which he command you to
perform even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tabl of
stone

4:14 and the lord command me at that time to teach you statut and
judgment that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
possess it

4:15 take ye therefor good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
of similitud on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of
the midst of the fire: 4:16 lest ye corrupt yourselv and make you a
graven imag the similitud of ani figur the like of male or
femal 4:17 the like of ani beast that is on the earth the
like of ani wing fowl that flieth in the air 4:18 the like
of ani thing that creepeth on the ground the like of ani fish
that is in the water beneath the earth: 4:19 and lest thou lift up
thine eye unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and
the star even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship
them and serv them which the lord thi god hath divid unto all
nation under the whole heaven

4:20 but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the
iron furnac even out of egypt to be unto him a peopl of
inherit as ye are thi day

4:21 furthermor the lord wa angri with me for your sake and sware
that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto
that good land which the lord thi god giveth thee for an inheritance:
4:22 but i must die in thi land i must not go over jordan: but ye
shall go over and possess that good land

4:23 take heed unto yourselv lest ye forget the coven of the
lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven imag or
the like of ani thing which the lord thi god hath forbidden thee

4:24 for the lord thi god is a consum fire even a jealou god

4:25 when thou shalt beget children and children children and ye
shall have remain long in the land and shall corrupt yourselv
and make a graven imag or the like of ani thing and shall do
evil in the sight of the lord thi god to provok him to anger: 4:26 i
call heaven and earth to wit against you thi day that ye shall
soon utterli perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to
possess it; ye shall not prolong your day upon it but shall utterli
be destroy

4:27 and the lord shall scatter you among the nation and ye shall be
left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you

4:28 and there ye shall serv god the work of men hand wood and
stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell

4:29 but if from thenc thou shalt seek the lord thi god thou shalt
find him if thou seek him with all thi heart and with all thi soul

4:30 when thou art in tribul and all these thing are come upon
thee even in the latter day if thou turn to the lord thi god and
shalt be obedi unto hi voice; 4:31 (for the lord thi god is a
merci god;) he will not forsak thee neither destroy thee nor
forget the coven of thi father which he sware unto them

4:32 for ask now of the day that are past which were befor thee
sinc the day that god creat man upon the earth and ask from the
one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been ani such
thing as thi great thing is or hath been heard like it? 4:33 did
ever peopl hear the voic of god speak out of the midst of the
fire as thou hast heard and live? 4:34 or hath god assay to go
and take him a nation from the midst of anoth nation by
temptat by sign and by wonder and by war and by a mighti
hand and by a stretch out arm and by great terror accord to
all that the lord your god did for you in egypt befor your eyes?
4:35 unto thee it wa shew that thou mightest know that the lord he
is god; there is none els besid him

4:36 out of heaven he made thee to hear hi voic that he might
instruct thee: and upon earth he shew thee hi great fire; and thou
heardest hi word out of the midst of the fire

4:37 and becaus he love thi father therefor he chose their seed
after them and brought thee out in hi sight with hi mighti power
out of egypt; 4:38 to drive out nation from befor thee greater and
mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for
an inherit as it is thi day

4:39 know therefor thi day and consid it in thine heart that the
lord he is god in heaven abov and upon the earth beneath: there is
none els

4:40 thou shalt keep therefor hi statut and hi command
which i command thee thi day that it may go well with thee and with
thi children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thi day upon
the earth which the lord thi god giveth thee for ever

4:41 then mose sever three citi on thi side jordan toward the
sunrising; 4:42 that the slayer might flee thither which should kill
hi neighbour unawar and hate him not in time past; and that
flee unto one of these citi he might live: 4:43 name bezer in
the wilder in the plain countri of the reubenites; and ramoth in
gilead of the gadites; and golan in bashan of the manassit

4:44 and thi is the law which mose set befor the children of
israel: 4:45 these are the testimoni and the statut and the
judgment which mose spake unto the children of israel after they
came forth out of egypt

4:46 on thi side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the
land of sihon king of the amorit who dwelt at heshbon whom mose
and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of
egypt: 4:47 and they possess hi land and the land of og king of
bashan two king of the amorit which were on thi side jordan
toward the sunrising; 4:48 from aroer which is by the bank of the
river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon 4:49 and all the
plain on thi side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain
under the spring of pisgah

5:1 and mose call all israel and said unto them hear o israel
the statut and judgment which i speak in your ear thi day that
ye may learn them and keep and do them

5:2 the lord our god made a coven with us in horeb

5:3 the lord made not thi coven with our father but with us
even us who are all of us here aliv thi day

5:4 the lord talk with you face to face in the mount out of the
midst of the fire 5:5 (i stood between the lord and you at that time
to shew you the word of the lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire and went not up into the mount;) say 5:6 i am the lord thi
god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the hous of
bondag

5:7 thou shalt have none other god befor me

5:8 thou shalt not make thee ani graven imag or ani like of ani
thing that is in heaven abov or that is in the earth beneath or
that is in the water beneath the earth: 5:9 thou shalt not bow down
thyself unto them nor serv them: for i the lord thi god am a jealou
god visit the iniqu of the father upon the children unto the
third and fourth gener of them that hate me 5:10 and shew
merci unto thousand of them that love me and keep my command

5:11 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thi god in vain: for the
lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh hi name in vain

5:12 keep the sabbath day to sanctifi it as the lord thi god hath
command thee

5:13 six day thou shalt labour and do all thi work: 5:14 but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thi god: in it thou shalt not
do ani work thou nor thi son nor thi daughter nor thi manserv
nor thi maidserv nor thine ox nor thine ass nor ani of thi
cattl nor thi stranger that is within thi gates; that thi manserv
and thi maidserv may rest as well as thou

5:15 and rememb that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and
that the lord thi god brought thee out thenc through a mighti hand
and by a stretch out arm: therefor the lord thi god command thee
to keep the sabbath day

5:16 honour thi father and thi mother as the lord thi god hath
command thee; that thi day may be prolong and that it may go
well with thee in the land which the lord thi god giveth thee

5:17 thou shalt not kill

5:18 neither shalt thou commit adulteri

5:19 neither shalt thou steal

5:20 neither shalt thou bear fals wit against thi neighbour

5:21 neither shalt thou desir thi neighbour wife neither shalt
thou covet thi neighbour hous hi field or hi manserv or hi
maidserv hi ox or hi ass or ani thing that is thi neighbour

5:22 these word the lord spake unto all your assembl in the mount
out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick dark
with a great voice: and he ad no more and he wrote them in two
tabl of stone and deliv them unto me

5:23 and it came to pass when ye heard the voic out of the midst of
the dark (for the mountain did burn with fire) that ye came near
unto me even all the head of your tribe and your elders; 5:24 and
ye said behold the lord our god hath shew us hi glori and hi
great and we have heard hi voic out of the midst of the fire:
we have seen thi day that god doth talk with man and he liveth

5:25 now therefor whi should we die? for thi great fire will consum
us: if we hear the voic of the lord our god ani more then we shall
die

5:26 for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voic of the
live god speak out of the midst of the fire as we have and
lived? 5:27 go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall
say: and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto
thee; and we will hear it and do it

5:28 and the lord heard the voic of your word when ye spake unto
me; and the lord said unto me i have heard the voic of the word of
thi peopl which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all
that they have spoken

5:29 o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me
and keep all my command alway that it might be well with them
and with their children for ever! 5:30 go say to them get you into
your tent again

5:31 but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto
thee all the command and the statut and the judgment which
thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give
them to possess it

5:32 ye shall observ to do therefor as the lord your god hath
command you: ye shall not turn asid to the right hand or to the
left

5:33 ye shall walk in all the way which the lord your god hath
command you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and
that ye may prolong your day in the land which ye shall possess

6:1 now these are the command the statut and the judgment
which the lord your god command to teach you that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 that thou mightest fear
the lord thi god to keep all hi statut and hi command which
i command thee thou and thi son and thi son son all the day of
thi life; and that thi day may be prolong

6:3 hear therefor o israel and observ to do it; that it may be
well with thee and that ye may increas mightili as the lord god of
thi father hath promis thee in the land that floweth with milk and
honey

6:4 hear o israel: the lord our god is one lord: 6:5 and thou shalt
love the lord thi god with all thine heart and with all thi soul and
with all thi might

6:6 and these word which i command thee thi day shall be in thine
heart: 6:7 and thou shalt teach them dilig unto thi children and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine hous and when thou
walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up

6:8 and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they
shall be as frontlet between thine eye

6:9 and thou shalt write them upon the post of thi hous and on thi
gate

6:10 and it shall be when the lord thi god shall have brought thee
into the land which he sware unto thi father to abraham to isaac
and to jacob to give thee great and goodli citi which thou
buildedst not 6:11 and hous full of all good thing which thou
filledst not and well dig which thou diggedst not vineyard and
oliv tree which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and
be full; 6:12 then bewar lest thou forget the lord which brought
thee forth out of the land of egypt from the hous of bondag

6:13 thou shalt fear the lord thi god and serv him and shalt swear
by hi name

6:14 ye shall not go after other god of the god of the peopl which
are round about you; 6:15 (for the lord thi god is a jealou god among
you) lest the anger of the lord thi god be kindl against thee and
destroy thee from off the face of the earth

6:16 ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempt him in
massah

6:17 ye shall dilig keep the command of the lord your god
and hi testimoni and hi statut which he hath command thee

6:18 and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
the lord: that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in
and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thi father

6:19 to cast out all thine enemi from befor thee as the lord hath
spoken

6:20 and when thi son asketh thee in time to come say what mean
the testimoni and the statut and the judgment which the lord
our god hath command you? 6:21 then thou shalt say unto thi son we
were pharaoh bondmen in egypt; and the lord brought us out of egypt
with a mighti hand: 6:22 and the lord shew sign and wonder great
and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all hi household befor
our eyes: 6:23 and he brought us out from thenc that he might bring
us in to give us the land which he sware unto our father

6:24 and the lord command us to do all these statut to fear the
lord our god for our good alway that he might preserv us aliv as
it is at thi day

6:25 and it shall be our righteous if we observ to do all these
command befor the lord our god as he hath command us

7:1 when the lord thi god shall bring thee into the land whither thou
goest to possess it and hath cast out mani nation befor thee the
hittit and the girgashit and the amorit and the canaanit
and the perizzit and the hivit and the jebusit seven nation
greater and mightier than thou; 7:2 and when the lord thi god shall
deliv them befor thee; thou shalt smite them and utterli destroy
them; thou shalt make no coven with them nor shew merci unto them:
7:3 neither shalt thou make marriag with them; thi daughter thou
shalt not give unto hi son nor hi daughter shalt thou take unto thi
son

7:4 for they will turn away thi son from follow me that they may
serv other gods: so will the anger of the lord be kindl against
you and destroy thee suddenli

7:5 but thu shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altar
and break down their imag and cut down their grove and burn their
graven imag with fire

7:6 for thou art an holi peopl unto the lord thi god: the lord thi
god hath chosen thee to be a special peopl unto himself abov all
peopl that are upon the face of the earth

7:7 the lord did not set hi love upon you nor choos you becaus ye
were more in number than ani people; for ye were the fewest of all
people: 7:8 but becaus the lord love you and becaus he would keep
the oath which he had sworn unto your father hath the lord brought
you out with a mighti hand and redeem you out of the hous of
bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt

7:9 know therefor that the lord thi god he is god the faith god
which keepeth coven and merci with them that love him and keep hi
command to a thousand generations; 7:10 and repayeth them that
hate him to their face to destroy them: he will not be slack to him
that hateth him he will repay him to hi face

7:11 thou shalt therefor keep the command and the statut and
the judgment which i command thee thi day to do them

7:12 wherefor it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these
judgment and keep and do them that the lord thi god shall keep
unto thee the coven and the merci which he sware unto thi fathers:
7:13 and he will love thee and bless thee and multipli thee: he will
also bless the fruit of thi womb and the fruit of thi land thi corn
and thi wine and thine oil the increas of thi kine and the flock
of thi sheep in the land which he sware unto thi father to give
thee

7:14 thou shalt be bless abov all people: there shall not be male
or femal barren among you or among your cattl

7:15 and the lord will take away from thee all sick and will put
none of the evil diseas of egypt which thou knowest upon thee; but
will lay them upon all them that hate thee

7:16 and thou shalt consum all the peopl which the lord thi god
shall deliv thee; thine eye shall have no piti upon them: neither
shalt thou serv their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee

7:17 if thou shalt say in thine heart these nation are more than i;
how can i dispossess them? 7:18 thou shalt not be afraid of them: but
shalt well rememb what the lord thi god did unto pharaoh and unto
all egypt; 7:19 the great temptat which thine eye saw and the
sign and the wonder and the mighti hand and the stretch out
arm wherebi the lord thi god brought thee out: so shall the lord thi
god do unto all the peopl of whom thou art afraid

7:20 moreov the lord thi god will send the hornet among them until
they that are left and hide themselv from thee be destroy

7:21 thou shalt not be affright at them: for the lord thi god is
among you a mighti god and terribl

7:22 and the lord thi god will put out those nation befor thee by
littl and little: thou mayest not consum them at onc lest the
beast of the field increas upon thee

7:23 but the lord thi god shall deliv them unto thee and shall
destroy them with a mighti destruct until they be destroy

7:24 and he shall deliv their king into thine hand and thou shalt
destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be abl to
stand befor thee until thou have destroy them

7:25 the graven imag of their god shall ye burn with fire: thou
shalt not desir the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto
thee lest thou be snare therin: for it is an abomin to the lord
thi god

7:26 neither shalt thou bring an abomin into thine hous lest
thou be a curs thing like it: but thou shalt utterli detest it and
thou shalt utterli abhor it; for it is a curs thing

8:1 all the command which i command thee thi day shall ye
observ to do that ye may live and multipli and go in and possess
the land which the lord sware unto your father

8:2 and thou shalt rememb all the way which the lord thi god led
thee these forti year in the wilder to humbl thee and to prove
thee to know what wa in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep hi
command or no

8:3 and he humbl thee and suffer thee to hunger and fed thee
with manna which thou knewest not neither did thi father know; that
he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread onli but by
everi word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live

8:4 thi raiment wax not old upon thee neither did thi foot swell
these forti year

8:5 thou shalt also consid in thine heart that as a man chasteneth
hi son so the lord thi god chasteneth thee

8:6 therefor thou shalt keep the command of the lord thi god to
walk in hi way and to fear him

8:7 for the lord thi god bringeth thee into a good land a land of
brook of water of fountain and depth that spring out of valley
and hills; 8:8 a land of wheat and barley and vine and fig tree
and pomegranates; a land of oil oliv and honey; 8:9 a land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarc thou shalt not lack ani thing
in it; a land whose stone are iron and out of whose hill thou
mayest dig brass

8:10 when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord
thi god for the good land which he hath given thee

8:11 bewar that thou forget not the lord thi god in not keep hi
command and hi judgment and hi statut which i command
thee thi day: 8:12 lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast
built goodli hous and dwelt therein; 8:13 and when thi herd and
thi flock multipli and thi silver and thi gold is multipli and
all that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 then thine heart be lift up
and thou forget the lord thi god which brought thee forth out of the
land of egypt from the hous of bondage; 8:15 who led thee through
that great and terribl wilder wherein were fieri serpent and
scorpion and drought where there wa no water; who brought thee
forth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 who fed thee in the
wilder with manna which thi father knew not that he might
humbl thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thi
latter end; 8:17 and thou say in thine heart my power and the might
of mine hand hath gotten me thi wealth

8:18 but thou shalt rememb the lord thi god: for it is he that
giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish hi coven
which he sware unto thi father as it is thi day

8:19 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thi god and
walk after other god and serv them and worship them i testifi
against you thi day that ye shall sure perish

8:20 as the nation which the lord destroyeth befor your face so
shall ye perish; becaus ye would not be obedi unto the voic of
the lord your god

9:1 hear o israel: thou art to pass over jordan thi day to go in to
possess nation greater and mightier than thyself citi great and
fenc up to heaven 9:2 a peopl great and tall the children of the
anakim whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can
stand befor the children of anak! 9:3 understand therefor thi day
that the lord thi god is he which goeth over befor thee; as a
consum fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down
befor thi face: so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them
quickli as the lord hath said unto thee

9:4 speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thi god hath
cast them out from befor thee say for my righteous the lord
hath brought me in to possess thi land: but for the wicked of
these nation the lord doth drive them out from befor thee

9:5 not for thi righteous or for the upright of thine heart
dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wicked of these
nation the lord thi god doth drive them out from befor thee and
that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thi father
abraham isaac and jacob

9:6 understand therefor that the lord thi god giveth thee not thi
good land to possess it for thi righteousness; for thou art a
stiffneck peopl

9:7 rememb and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thi god to
wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of egypt until ye came unto thi place ye have been
rebelli against the lord

9:8 also in horeb ye provok the lord to wrath so that the lord wa
angri with you to have destroy you

9:9 when i wa gone up into the mount to receiv the tabl of stone
even the tabl of the coven which the lord made with you then i
abod in the mount forti day and forti night i neither did eat
bread nor drink water: 9:10 and the lord deliv unto me two tabl
of stone written with the finger of god; and on them wa written
accord to all the word which the lord spake with you in the mount
out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembl

9:11 and it came to pass at the end of forti day and forti night
that the lord gave me the two tabl of stone even the tabl of the
coven

9:12 and the lord said unto me aris get thee down quickli from
hence; for thi peopl which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have
corrupt themselves; they are quickli turn asid out of the way
which i command them; they have made them a molten imag

9:13 furthermor the lord spake unto me say i have seen thi
peopl and behold it is a stiffneck people: 9:14 let me alon
that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven:
and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they

9:15 so i turn and came down from the mount and the mount burn
with fire: and the two tabl of the coven were in my two hand

9:16 and i look and behold ye had sin against the lord your
god and had made you a molten calf: ye had turn asid quickli out
of the way which the lord had command you

9:17 and i took the two tabl and cast them out of my two hand and
brake them befor your eye

9:18 and i fell down befor the lord as at the first forti day and
forti nights: i did neither eat bread nor drink water becaus of all
your sin which ye sin in do wickedli in the sight of the lord
to provok him to anger

9:19 for i wa afraid of the anger and hot displeasur wherewith the
lord wa wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearken unto
me at that time also

9:20 and the lord wa veri angri with aaron to have destroy him: and
i pray for aaron also the same time

9:21 and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it
with fire and stamp it and ground it veri small even until it wa
as small as dust: and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that
descend out of the mount

9:22 and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye
provok the lord to wrath

9:23 likewis when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea say go up
and possess the land which i have given you; then ye rebel against
the command of the lord your god and ye believ him not nor
hearken to hi voic

9:24 ye have been rebelli against the lord from the day that i knew
you

9:25 thu i fell down befor the lord forti day and forti night as
i fell down at the first; becaus the lord had said he would destroy
you

9:26 i pray therefor unto the lord and said o lord god destroy
not thi peopl and thine inherit which thou hast redeem through
thi great which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a
mighti hand

9:27 rememb thi servant abraham isaac and jacob; look not unto
the stubborn of thi peopl nor to their wicked nor to their
sin: 9:28 lest the land whenc thou broughtest us out say becaus the
lord wa not abl to bring them into the land which he promis them
and becaus he hate them he hath brought them out to slay them in
the wilder

9:29 yet they are thi peopl and thine inherit which thou
broughtest out by thi mighti power and by thi stretch out arm

10:1 at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tabl of stone
like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee
an ark of wood

10:2 and i will write on the tabl the word that were in the first
tabl which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark

10:3 and i made an ark of shittim wood and hew two tabl of stone
like unto the first and went up into the mount have the two tabl
in mine hand

10:4 and he wrote on the tabl accord to the first write the
ten command which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of
the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the lord gave
them unto me

10:5 and i turn myself and came down from the mount and put the
tabl in the ark which i had made; and there they be as the lord
command me

10:6 and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the
children of jaakan to mosera: there aaron die and there he wa
buried; and eleazar hi son minist in the priest offic in hi
stead

10:7 from thenc they journey unto gudgodah; and from gudgodah to
jotbath a land of river of water

10:8 at that time the lord separ the tribe of levi to bear the
ark of the coven of the lord to stand befor the lord to minist
unto him and to bless in hi name unto thi day

10:9 wherefor levi hath no part nor inherit with hi brethren;
the lord is hi inherit accord as the lord thi god promis
him

10:10 and i stay in the mount accord to the first time forti
day and forti nights; and the lord hearken unto me at that time
also and the lord would not destroy thee

10:11 and the lord said unto me aris take thi journey befor the
peopl that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto
their father to give unto them

10:12 and now israel what doth the lord thi god requir of thee but
to fear the lord thi god to walk in all hi way and to love him
and to serv the lord thi god with all thi heart and with all thi
soul 10:13 to keep the command of the lord and hi statut
which i command thee thi day for thi good? 10:14 behold the heaven
and the heaven of heaven is the lord thi god the earth also with
all that therein is

10:15 onli the lord had a delight in thi father to love them and he
chose their seed after them even you abov all peopl as it is thi
day

10:16 circumcis therefor the foreskin of your heart and be no more
stiffneck

10:17 for the lord your god is god of god and lord of lord a great
god a mighti and a terribl which regardeth not person nor taketh
reward: 10:18 he doth execut the judgment of the fatherless and
widow and loveth the stranger in give him food and raiment

10:19 love ye therefor the stranger: for ye were stranger in the
land of egypt

10:20 thou shalt fear the lord thi god; him shalt thou serv and to
him shalt thou cleav and swear by hi name

10:21 he is thi prais and he is thi god that hath done for thee
these great and terribl thing which thine eye have seen

10:22 thi father went down into egypt with threescor and ten
persons; and now the lord thi god hath made thee as the star of
heaven for multitud

11:1 therefor thou shalt love the lord thi god and keep hi charg
and hi statut and hi judgment and hi command alway

11:2 and know ye thi day: for i speak not with your children which
have not known and which have not seen the chastis of the lord
your god hi great hi mighti hand and hi stretch out arm
11:3 and hi miracl and hi act which he did in the midst of
egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all hi land; 11:4 and
what he did unto the armi of egypt unto their hors and to their
chariots; how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as
they pursu after you and how the lord hath destroy them unto thi
day; 11:5 and what he did unto you in the wilder until ye came
into thi place; 11:6 and what he did unto dathan and abiram the son
of eliab the son of reuben: how the earth open her mouth and
swallow them up and their household and their tent and all the
substanc that wa in their possess in the midst of all israel:
11:7 but your eye have seen all the great act of the lord which he
did

11:8 therefor shall ye keep all the command which i command you
thi day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land
whither ye go to possess it; 11:9 and that ye may prolong your day in
the land which the lord sware unto your father to give unto them and
to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey

11:10 for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the
land of egypt from whenc ye came out where thou sowedst thi seed
and wateredst it with thi foot as a garden of herbs: 11:11 but the
land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hill and valley and
drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 a land which the lord thi
god careth for: the eye of the lord thi god are alway upon it from
the begin of the year even unto the end of the year

11:13 and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken dilig unto
my command which i command you thi day to love the lord your
god and to serv him with all your heart and with all your soul
11:14 that i will give you the rain of your land in hi due season
the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thi
corn and thi wine and thine oil

11:15 and i will send grass in thi field for thi cattl that thou
mayest eat and be full

11:16 take heed to yourselv that your heart be not deceiv and ye
turn asid and serv other god and worship them; 11:17 and then the
lord wrath be kindl against you and he shut up the heaven that
there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye
perish quickli from off the good land which the lord giveth you

11:18 therefor shall ye lay up these my word in your heart and in
your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be
as frontlet between your eye

11:19 and ye shall teach them your children speak of them when
thou sittest in thine hous and when thou walkest by the way when
thou liest down and when thou risest up

11:20 and thou shalt write them upon the door post of thine hous
and upon thi gates: 11:21 that your day may be multipli and the
day of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your
father to give them as the day of heaven upon the earth

11:22 for if ye shall dilig keep all these command which i
command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all hi
way and to cleav unto him; 11:23 then will the lord drive out all
these nation from befor you and ye shall possess greater nation
and mightier than yourselv

11:24 everi place whereon the sole of your feet shall tread shall be
yours: from the wilder and lebanon from the river the river
euphrat even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be

11:25 there shall no man be abl to stand befor you: for the lord
your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the
land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you

11:26 behold i set befor you thi day a bless and a curse; 11:27
a bless if ye obey the command of the lord your god which i
command you thi day: 11:28 and a curs if ye will not obey the
command of the lord your god but turn asid out of the way which
i command you thi day to go after other god which ye have not
known

11:29 and it shall come to pass when the lord thi god hath brought
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou
shalt put the bless upon mount gerizim and the curs upon mount
ebal

11:30 are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun
goeth down in the land of the canaanit which dwell in the
champaign over against gilgal besid the plain of moreh? 11:31 for
ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord
your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein

11:32 and ye shall observ to do all the statut and judgment which
i set befor you thi day

12:1 these are the statut and judgment which ye shall observ to
do in the land which the lord god of thi father giveth thee to
possess it all the day that ye live upon the earth

12:2 ye shall utterli destroy all the place wherein the nation
which ye shall possess serv their god upon the high mountain and
upon the hill and under everi green tree: 12:3 and ye shall
overthrow their altar and break their pillar and burn their grove
with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven imag of their god and
destroy the name of them out of that place

12:4 ye shall not do so unto the lord your god

12:5 but unto the place which the lord your god shall choos out of
all your tribe to put hi name there even unto hi habit shall
ye seek and thither thou shalt come: 12:6 and thither ye shall bring
your burnt offer and your sacrific and your tith and heav
offer of your hand and your vow and your freewil offer
and the firstl of your herd and of your flocks: 12:7 and there ye
shall eat befor the lord your god and ye shall rejoic in all that
ye put your hand unto ye and your household wherein the lord thi
god hath bless thee

12:8 ye shall not do after all the thing that we do here thi day
everi man whatsoev is right in hi own eye

12:9 for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inherit
which the lord your god giveth you

12:10 but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord
your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all
your enemi round about so that ye dwell in safety; 12:11 then there
shall be a place which the lord your god shall choos to caus hi
name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that i command you;
your burnt offer and your sacrific your tith and the heav
offer of your hand and all your choic vow which ye vow unto the
lord: 12:12 and ye shall rejoic befor the lord your god ye and
your son and your daughter and your menserv and your
maidserv and the levit that is within your gates; forasmuch as
he hath no part nor inherit with you

12:13 take heed to thyself that thou offer not thi burnt offer in
everi place that thou seest: 12:14 but in the place which the lord
shall choos in one of thi tribe there thou shalt offer thi burnt
offer and there thou shalt do all that i command thee

12:15 notwithstand thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thi gate
whatsoev thi soul lusteth after accord to the bless of the
lord thi god which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may
eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart

12:16 onli ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth
as water

12:17 thou mayest not eat within thi gate the tith of thi corn or
of thi wine or of thi oil or the firstl of thi herd or of thi
flock nor ani of thi vow which thou vowest nor thi freewil
offer or heav offer of thine hand: 12:18 but thou must eat
them befor the lord thi god in the place which the lord thi god shall
choos thou and thi son and thi daughter and thi manserv and
thi maidserv and the levit that is within thi gates: and thou
shalt rejoic befor the lord thi god in all that thou puttest thine
hand unto

12:19 take heed to thyself that thou forsak not the levit as long as
thou livest upon the earth

12:20 when the lord thi god shall enlarg thi border as he hath
promis thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh becaus thi soul
longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh whatsoev thi soul
lusteth after

god shall choose: one from among thi brethren shalt thou set king over
thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thi
brother

17:16 but he shall not multipli hors to himself nor caus the
peopl to return to egypt to the end that he should multipli horses:
forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return
no more that way

17:17 neither shall he multipli wive to himself that hi heart turn
not away: neither shall he greatli multipli to himself silver and
gold

17:18 and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of hi kingdom
that he shall write him a copi of thi law in a book out of that which
is befor the priest the levites: 17:19 and it shall be with him and
he shall read therein all the day of hi life: that he may learn to
fear the lord hi god to keep all the word of thi law and these
statut to do them: 17:20 that hi heart be not lift up abov hi
brethren and that he turn not asid from the command to the
right hand or to the left: to the end that he may prolong hi day in
hi kingdom he and hi children in the midst of israel

18:1 the priest the levit and all the tribe of levi shall have no
part nor inherit with israel: they shall eat the offer of the
lord made by fire and hi inherit

18:2 therefor shall they have no inherit among their brethren:
the lord is their inherit as he hath said unto them

18:3 and thi shall be the priest due from the peopl from them
that offer a sacrific whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give
unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheek and the maw

18:4 the firstfruit also of thi corn of thi wine and of thine oil
and the first of the fleec of thi sheep shalt thou give him

18:5 for the lord thi god hath chosen him out of all thi tribe to
stand to minist in the name of the lord him and hi son for ever

18:6 and if a levit come from ani of thi gate out of all israel
where he sojourn and come with all the desir of hi mind unto the
place which the lord shall choose; 18:7 then he shall minist in the
name of the lord hi god as all hi brethren the levit do which
stand there befor the lord

18:8 they shall have like portion to eat besid that which cometh of
the sale of hi patrimoni

18:9 when thou art come into the land which the lord thi god giveth
thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abomin of those
nation

18:10 there shall not be found among you ani one that maketh hi son
or hi daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divin or
an observ of time or an enchant or a witch

18:11 or a charmer or a consult with familiar spirit or a wizard
or a necromanc

18:12 for all that do these thing are an abomin unto the lord:
and becaus of these abomin the lord thi god doth drive them out
from befor thee

18:13 thou shalt be perfect with the lord thi god

18:14 for these nation which thou shalt possess hearken unto
observ of time and unto diviners: but as for thee the lord thi
god hath not suffer thee so to do

18:15 the lord thi god will rais up unto thee a prophet from the
midst of thee of thi brethren like unto me; unto him ye shall
hearken; 18:16 accord to all that thou desiredst of the lord thi
god in horeb in the day of the assembl say let me not hear again
the voic of the lord my god neither let me see thi great fire ani
more that i die not

18:17 and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they
have spoken

18:18 i will rais them up a prophet from among their brethren like
unto thee and will put my word in hi mouth; and he shall speak unto
them all that i shall command him

18:19 and it shall come to pass that whosoev will not hearken unto
my word which he shall speak in my name i will requir it of him

18:20 but the prophet which shall presum to speak a word in my name
which i have not command him to speak or that shall speak in the
name of other god even that prophet shall die

18:21 and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which
the lord hath not spoken? 18:22 when a prophet speaketh in the name
of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the
thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him

19:1 when the lord thi god hath cut off the nation whose land the
lord thi god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in
their citi and in their houses; 19:2 thou shalt separ three
citi for thee in the midst of thi land which the lord thi god
giveth thee to possess it

19:3 thou shalt prepar thee a way and divid the coast of thi land
which the lord thi god giveth thee to inherit into three part that
everi slayer may flee thither

19:4 and thi is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither
that he may live: whoso killeth hi neighbour ignorantli whom he
hate not in time past; 19:5 as when a man goeth into the wood with
hi neighbour to hew wood and hi hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe
to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helv and
lighteth upon hi neighbour that he die; he shall flee unto one of
those citi and live: 19:6 lest the aveng of the blood pursu the
slayer while hi heart is hot and overtak him becaus the way is
long and slay him; wherea he wa not worthi of death inasmuch as he
hate him not in time past

19:7 wherefor i command thee say thou shalt separ three
citi for thee

19:8 and if the lord thi god enlarg thi coast as he hath sworn unto
thi father and give thee all the land which he promis to give unto
thi fathers; 19:9 if thou shalt keep all these command to do
them which i command thee thi day to love the lord thi god and to
walk ever in hi ways; then shalt thou add three citi more for thee
besid these three: 19:10 that innoc blood be not shed in thi land
which the lord thi god giveth thee for an inherit and so blood be
upon thee

19:11 but if ani man hate hi neighbour and lie in wait for him and
rise up against him and smite him mortal that he die and fleeth
into one of these cities: 19:12 then the elder of hi citi shall send
and fetch him thenc and deliv him into the hand of the aveng of
blood that he may die

19:13 thine eye shall not piti him but thou shalt put away the guilt
of innoc blood from israel that it may go well with thee

19:14 thou shalt not remov thi neighbour landmark which they of
old time have set in thine inherit which thou shalt inherit in
the land that the lord thi god giveth thee to possess it

19:15 one wit shall not rise up against a man for ani iniqu or
for ani sin in ani sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two
wit or at the mouth of three wit shall the matter be
establish

19:16 if a fals wit rise up against ani man to testifi against
him that which is wrong; 19:17 then both the men between whom the
controversi is shall stand befor the lord befor the priest and
the judg which shall be in those days; 19:18 and the judg shall
make dilig inquisition: and behold if the wit be a fals
wit and hath testifi fals against hi brother; 19:19 then
shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto hi brother:
so shalt thou put the evil away from among you

19:20 and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall
henceforth commit no more ani such evil among you

19:21 and thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life eye
for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot

20:1 when thou goest out to battl against thine enemi and seest
hors and chariot and a peopl more than thou be not afraid of
them: for the lord thi god is with thee which brought thee up out of
the land of egypt

20:2 and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battl that the
priest shall approach and speak unto the peopl 20:3 and shall say
unto them hear o israel ye approach thi day unto battl against
your enemies: let not your heart faint fear not and do not trembl
neither be ye terrifi becaus of them; 20:4 for the lord your god is
he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemi to save
you

20:5 and the offic shall speak unto the peopl say what man is
there that hath built a new hous and hath not dedic it? let him
go and return to hi hous lest he die in the battl and anoth man
dedic it

20:6 and what man is he that hath plant a vineyard and hath not yet
eaten of it? let him also go and return unto hi hous lest he die in
the battl and anoth man eat of it

20:7 and what man is there that hath betroth a wife and hath not
taken her? let him go and return unto hi hous lest he die in the
battl and anoth man take her

20:8 and the offic shall speak further unto the peopl and they
shall say what man is there that is fear and fainthearted? let him
go and return unto hi hous lest hi brethren heart faint as well
as hi heart

20:9 and it shall be when the offic have made an end of speak
unto the peopl that they shall make captain of the armi to lead
the peopl

20:10 when thou comest nigh unto a citi to fight against it then
proclaim peac unto it

20:11 and it shall be if it make thee answer of peac and open unto
thee then it shall be that all the peopl that is found therein
shall be tributari unto thee and they shall serv thee

20:12 and if it will make no peac with thee but will make war
against thee then thou shalt besieg it: 20:13 and when the lord thi
god hath deliv it into thine hand thou shalt smite everi male
thereof with the edg of the sword: 20:14 but the women and the
littl one and the cattl and all that is in the citi even all the
spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the
spoil of thine enemi which the lord thi god hath given thee

20:15 thu shalt thou do unto all the citi which are veri far off
from thee which are not of the citi of these nation

20:16 but of the citi of these peopl which the lord thi god doth
give thee for an inherit thou shalt save aliv noth that
breatheth: 20:17 but thou shalt utterli destroy them; name the
hittit and the amorit the canaanit and the perizzit the

28:32 thi son and thi daughter shall be given unto anoth peopl
and thine eye shall look and fail with long for them all the day

which thou shalt see

28:35 the lord shall smite thee in the knee and in the leg with a

28:47 becaus thou servedst not the lord thi god with joy and

29:1 these are the word of the coven which the lord command
mose to make with the children of israel in the land of moab besid
the coven which he made with them in horeb

29:2 and mose call unto all israel and said unto them ye have
seen all that the lord did befor your eye in the land of egypt unto
pharaoh and unto all hi servant and unto all hi land; 29:3 the
great temptat which thine eye have seen the sign and those
great miracles: 29:4 yet the lord hath not given you an heart to
perceiv and eye to see and ear to hear unto thi day

29:5 and i have led you forti year in the wilderness: your cloth
are not waxen old upon you and thi shoe is not waxen old upon thi
foot

29:6 ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong
drink: that ye might know that i am the lord your god

29:7 and when ye came unto thi place sihon the king of heshbon and
og the king of bashan came out against us unto battl and we smote
them: 29:8 and we took their land and gave it for an inherit unto
the reubenit and to the gadit and to the half tribe of manasseh

29:9 keep therefor the word of thi coven and do them that ye
may prosper in all that ye do

29:10 ye stand thi day all of you befor the lord your god; your
captain of your tribe your elder and your offic with all the
men of israel 29:11 your littl one your wive and thi stranger
that is in thi camp from the hewer of thi wood unto the drawer of thi
water: 29:12 that thou shouldest enter into coven with the lord thi
god and into hi oath which the lord thi god maketh with thee thi
day: 29:13 that he may establish thee to day for a peopl unto
himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto
thee and as he hath sworn unto thi father to abraham to isaac and
to jacob

29:14 neither with you onli do i make thi coven and thi oath;
29:15 but with him that standeth here with us thi day befor the lord
our god and also with him that is not here with us thi day: 29:16
(for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt; and how we came
through the nation which ye pass by; 29:17 and ye have seen their
abomin and their idol wood and stone silver and gold which
were among them:) 29:18 lest there should be among you man or woman
or famili or tribe whose heart turneth away thi day from the lord
our god to go and serv the god of these nations; lest there should
be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 29:19 and it come
to pass when he heareth the word of thi curs that he bless
himself in hi heart say i shall have peac though i walk in the
imagin of mine heart to add drunken to thirst: 29:20 the
lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and hi
jealousi shall smoke against that man and all the curs that are
written in thi book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out
hi name from under heaven

29:21 and the lord shall separ him unto evil out of all the tribe
of israel accord to all the curs of the coven that are
written in thi book of the law: 29:22 so that the gener to come
of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that
shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagu of
that land and the sick which the lord hath laid upon it; 29:23
and that the whole land thereof is brimston and salt and burn
that it is not sown nor beareth nor ani grass groweth therein like
the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the
lord overthrew in hi anger and in hi wrath: 29:24 even all nation
shall say wherefor hath the lord done thu unto thi land? what
meaneth the heat of thi great anger? 29:25 then men shall say
becaus they have forsaken the coven of the lord god of their
father which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the
land of egypt: 29:26 for they went and serv other god and
worship them god whom they knew not and whom he had not given
unto them: 29:27 and the anger of the lord wa kindl against thi
land to bring upon it all the curs that are written in thi book:
29:28 and the lord root them out of their land in anger and in
wrath and in great indign and cast them into anoth land as
it is thi day

29:29 the secret thing belong unto the lord our god: but those thing
which are reveal belong unto us and to our children for ever that
we may do all the word of thi law

30:1 and it shall come to pass when all these thing are come upon
thee the bless and the curs which i have set befor thee and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nation whither the lord
thi god hath driven thee 30:2 and shalt return unto the lord thi god
and shalt obey hi voic accord to all that i command thee thi
day thou and thi children with all thine heart and with all thi
soul; 30:3 that then the lord thi god will turn thi captiv and
have compass upon thee and will return and gather thee from all
the nation whither the lord thi god hath scatter thee

30:4 if ani of thine be driven out unto the outmost part of heaven
from thenc will the lord thi god gather thee and from thenc will he
fetch thee: 30:5 and the lord thi god will bring thee into the land
which thi father possess and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
thee good and multipli thee abov thi father

30:6 and the lord thi god will circumcis thine heart and the heart
of thi seed to love the lord thi god with all thine heart and with
all thi soul that thou mayest live

30:7 and the lord thi god will put all these curs upon thine
enemi and on them that hate thee which persecut thee

30:8 and thou shalt return and obey the voic of the lord and do all
hi command which i command thee thi day

30:9 and the lord thi god will make thee plenteou in everi work of
thine hand in the fruit of thi bodi and in the fruit of thi cattl
and in the fruit of thi land for good: for the lord will again
rejoic over thee for good as he rejoic over thi fathers: 30:10 if
thou shalt hearken unto the voic of the lord thi god to keep hi
command and hi statut which are written in thi book of the
law and if thou turn unto the lord thi god with all thine heart and
with all thi soul

30:11 for thi command which i command thee thi day it is not
hidden from thee neither is it far off

30:12 it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up
for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do
it? 30:13 neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who
shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear
it and do it? 30:14 but the word is veri nigh unto thee in thi
mouth and in thi heart that thou mayest do it

30:15 see i have set befor thee thi day life and good and death
and evil; 30:16 in that i command thee thi day to love the lord thi
god to walk in hi way and to keep hi command and hi
statut and hi judgment that thou mayest live and multiply: and
the lord thi god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
possess it

30:17 but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but
shalt be drawn away and worship other god and serv them; 30:18 i
denounc unto you thi day that ye shall sure perish and that ye
shall not prolong your day upon the land whither thou passest over
jordan to go to possess it

30:19 i call heaven and earth to record thi day against you that i
have set befor you life and death bless and cursing: therefor
choos life that both thou and thi seed may live: 30:20 that thou
mayest love the lord thi god and that thou mayest obey hi voic and
that thou mayest cleav unto him: for he is thi life and the length
of thi days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware
unto thi father to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them

31:1 and mose went and spake these word unto all israel

31:2 and he said unto them i am an hundr and twenti year old thi
day; i can no more go out and come in: also the lord hath said unto
me thou shalt not go over thi jordan

31:3 the lord thi god he will go over befor thee and he will
destroy these nation from befor thee and thou shalt possess them:
and joshua he shall go over befor thee as the lord hath said

31:4 and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og
king of the amorit and unto the land of them whom he destroy

31:5 and the lord shall give them up befor your face that ye may do
unto them accord unto all the command which i have command
you

31:6 be strong and of a good courag fear not nor be afraid of them:
for the lord thi god he it is that doth go with thee; he will not
fail thee nor forsak thee

31:7 and mose call unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of
all israel be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with
thi peopl unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their father
to give them; and thou shalt caus them to inherit it

31:8 and the lord he it is that doth go befor thee; he will be with
thee he will not fail thee neither forsak thee: fear not neither
be dismay

31:9 and mose wrote thi law and deliv it unto the priest the
son of levi which bare the ark of the coven of the lord and unto
all the elder of israel

31:10 and mose command them say at the end of everi seven
year in the solemn of the year of releas in the feast of
tabernacl 31:11 when all israel is come to appear befor the lord
thi god in the place which he shall choos thou shalt read thi law
befor all israel in their hear

31:12 gather the peopl togeth men and women and children and thi
stranger that is within thi gate that they may hear and that they
may learn and fear the lord your god and observ to do all the word
of thi law: 31:13 and that their children which have not known ani
thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye
live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it

31:14 and the lord said unto mose behold thi day approach that
thou must die: call joshua and present yourselv in the tabernacl
of the congreg that i may give him a charg and mose and
joshua went and present themselv in the tabernacl of the
congreg

31:15 and the lord appear in the tabernacl in a pillar of a cloud:
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacl

31:16 and the lord said unto mose behold thou shalt sleep with thi
fathers; and thi peopl will rise up and go a whore after the god
of the stranger of the land whither they go to be among them and
will forsak me and break my coven which i have made with them

31:17 then my anger shall be kindl against them in that day and i
will forsak them and i will hide my face from them and they shall
be devour and mani evil and troubl shall befal them; so that
they will say in that day are not these evil come upon us becaus
our god is not among us? 31:18 and i will sure hide my face in that
day for all the evil which they shall have wrought in that they are
turn unto other god

31:19 now therefor write ye thi song for you and teach it the
children of israel: put it in their mouth that thi song may be a
wit for me against the children of israel

31:20 for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware
unto their father that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall
have eaten and fill themselv and waxen fat; then will they turn
unto other god and serv them and provok me and break my
coven

31:21 and it shall come to pass when mani evil and troubl are
befallen them that thi song shall testifi against them as a witness;
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of their seed: for i
know their imagin which they go about even now befor i have
brought them into the land which i sware

31:22 mose therefor wrote thi song the same day and taught it the
children of israel

31:23 and he gave joshua the son of nun a charg and said be strong
and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of israel
into the land which i sware unto them: and i will be with thee

31:24 and it came to pass when mose had made an end of write the
word of thi law in a book until they were finish 31:25 that
mose command the levit which bare the ark of the coven of the
lord say 31:26 take thi book of the law and put it in the side
of the ark of the coven of the lord your god that it may be there
for a wit against thee

31:27 for i know thi rebellion and thi stiff neck: behold while i am
yet aliv with you thi day ye have been rebelli against the lord;
and how much more after my death? 31:28 gather unto me all the elder
of your tribe and your offic that i may speak these word in
their ear and call heaven and earth to record against them

31:29 for i know that after my death ye will utterli corrupt
yourselv and turn asid from the way which i have command you;
and evil will befal you in the latter days; becaus ye will do evil
in the sight of the lord to provok him to anger through the work of
your hand

31:30 and mose spake in the ear of all the congreg of israel
the word of thi song until they were end

32:1 give ear o ye heaven and i will speak; and hear o earth the
word of my mouth

32:2 my doctrin shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the
dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the shower upon
the grass: 32:3 becaus i will publish the name of the lord: ascrib
ye great unto our god

32:4 he is the rock hi work is perfect: for all hi way are
judgment: a god of truth and without iniqu just and right is he

32:5 they have corrupt themselv their spot is not the spot of hi
children: they are a pervers and crook gener

32:6 do ye thu requit the lord o foolish peopl and unwise? is not
he thi father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee and
establish thee? 32:7 rememb the day of old consid the year
of mani generations: ask thi father and he will shew thee; thi
elder and they will tell thee

32:8 when the most high divid to the nation their inherit when
he separ the son of adam he set the bound of the peopl
accord to the number of the children of israel

32:9 for the lord portion is hi people; jacob is the lot of hi
inherit

32:10 he found him in a desert land and in the wast howl
wilderness; he led him about he instruct him he kept him as the
appl of hi eye

32:11 as an eagl stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young
spreadeth abroad her wing taketh them beareth them on her wings:
32:12 so the lord alon did lead him and there wa no strang god
with him

32:13 he made him ride on the high place of the earth that he might
eat the increas of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of
the rock and oil out of the flinti rock; 32:14 butter of kine and
milk of sheep with fat of lamb and ram of the breed of bashan and
goat with the fat of kidney of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure
blood of the grape

32:15 but jeshurun wax fat and kicked: thou art waxen fat thou art
grown thick thou art cover with fatness; then he forsook god which
made him and lightli esteem the rock of hi salvat

32:16 they provok him to jealousi with strang god with
abomin provok they him to anger

32:17 they sacrif unto devil not to god; to god whom they knew
not to new god that came newli up whom your father fear not

32:18 of the rock that begat thee thou art unmind and hast
forgotten god that form thee

32:19 and when the lord saw it he abhor them becaus of the
provok of hi son and of hi daughter

32:20 and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what
their end shall be: for they are a veri froward gener children
in whom is no faith

32:21 they have move me to jealousi with that which is not god; they
have provok me to anger with their vanities: and i will move them to
jealousi with those which are not a people; i will provok them to
anger with a foolish nation

32:22 for a fire is kindl in mine anger and shall burn unto the
lowest hell and shall consum the earth with her increas and set on
fire the foundat of the mountain

32:23 i will heap mischief upon them; i will spend mine arrow upon
them

32:24 they shall be burnt with hunger and devour with burn heat
and with bitter destruction: i will also send the teeth of beast upon
them with the poison of serpent of the dust

32:25 the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the
young man and the virgin the suckl also with the man of gray
hair

32:26 i said i would scatter them into corner i would make the
remembr of them to ceas from among men: 32:27 were it not that i
fear the wrath of the enemi lest their adversari should behav
themselv strang and lest they should say our hand is high and
the lord hath not done all thi

32:28 for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there ani
understand in them

32:29 o that they were wise that they understood thi that they
would consid their latter end! 32:30 how should one chase a
thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had
sold them and the lord had shut them up? 32:31 for their rock is not
as our rock even our enemi themselv be judg

32:32 for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the field of
gomorrah: their grape are grape of gall their cluster are bitter:
32:33 their wine is the poison of dragon and the cruel venom of
asp

32:34 is not thi laid up in store with me and seal up among my
treasures? 32:35 to me belongeth vengeanc and recompence; their foot
shall slide in due time: for the day of their calam is at hand and
the thing that shall come upon them make hast

32:36 for the lord shall judg hi peopl and repent himself for hi
servant when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none
shut up or left

32:37 and he shall say where are their god their rock in whom they
trust 32:38 which did eat the fat of their sacrific and drank
the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you and
be your protect

32:39 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me: i
kill and i make alive; i wound and i heal: neither is there ani that
can deliv out of my hand

32:40 for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever

32:41 if i whet my glitter sword and mine hand take hold on
judgment; i will render vengeanc to mine enemi and will reward
them that hate me

32:42 i will make mine arrow drunk with blood and my sword shall
devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
captiv from the begin of reveng upon the enemi

32:43 rejoic o ye nation with hi people: for he will aveng the
blood of hi servant and will render vengeanc to hi adversari
and will be merci unto hi land and to hi peopl

32:44 and mose came and spake all the word of thi song in the ear
of the peopl he and hoshea the son of nun

32:45 and mose made an end of speak all these word to all israel:
32:46 and he said unto them set your heart unto all the word which
i testifi among you thi day which ye shall command your children to
observ to do all the word of thi law

32:47 for it is not a vain thing for you; becaus it is your life: and
through thi thing ye shall prolong your day in the land whither ye
go over jordan to possess it

32:48 and the lord spake unto mose that selfsam day say 32:49
get thee up into thi mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in
the land of moab that is over against jericho; and behold the land of
canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession:
32:50 and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gather unto
thi people; as aaron thi brother die in mount hor and wa gather
unto hi people: 32:51 becaus ye trespass against me among the
children of israel at the water of meribahkadesh in the wilder
of zin; becaus ye sanctifi me not in the midst of the children of
israel

32:52 yet thou shalt see the land befor thee; but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which i give the children of israel

33:1 and thi is the bless wherewith mose the man of god bless
the children of israel befor hi death

33:2 and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto
them; he shine forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousand
of saints: from hi right hand went a fieri law for them

33:3 yea he love the people; all hi saint are in thi hand: and
they sat down at thi feet; everi one shall receiv of thi word

33:4 mose command us a law even the inherit of the
congreg of jacob

33:5 and he wa king in jeshurun when the head of the peopl and the
tribe of israel were gather togeth

33:6 let reuben live and not die; and let not hi men be few

33:7 and thi is the bless of judah: and he said hear lord the
voic of judah and bring him unto hi people: let hi hand be
suffici for him; and be thou an help to him from hi enemi

33:8 and of levi he said let thi thummim and thi urim be with thi

2:1 and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spi
secretli say go view the land even jericho and they went and
came into an harlot hous name rahab and lodg there

2:2 and it wa told the king of jericho say behold there came
men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the
countri

2:3 and the king of jericho sent unto rahab say bring forth the
men that are come to thee which are enter into thine house: for
they be come to search out all the countri

2:4 and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thu there
came men unto me but i wist not whenc they were: 2:5 and it came to
pass about the time of shut of the gate when it wa dark that
the men went out: whither the men went i wot not: pursu after them
quickly; for ye shall overtak them

2:6 but she had brought them up to the roof of the hous and hid them
with the stalk of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof

2:7 and the men pursu after them the way to jordan unto the fords:
and as soon as they which pursu after them were gone out they shut
the gate

2:8 and befor they were laid down she came up unto them upon the
roof; 2:9 and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given
you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the
inhabit of the land faint becaus of you

2:10 for we have heard how the lord dri up the water of the red sea
for you when ye came out of egypt; and what ye did unto the two king
of the amorit that were on the other side jordan sihon and og
whom ye utterli destroy

2:11 and as soon as we had heard these thing our heart did melt
neither did there remain ani more courag in ani man becaus of you:
for the lord your god he is god in heaven abov and in earth
beneath

2:12 now therefor i pray you swear unto me by the lord sinc i

2:14 and the men answer her our life for your if ye utter not
thi our busi and it shall be when the lord hath given us the
land that we will deal kindli and truli with thee

2:15 then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
hous wa upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall

2:16 and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the
pursuer meet you; and hide yourselv there three day until the
pursuer be returned: and afterward may ye go your way

2:17 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of thi thine
oath which thou hast made us swear

2:18 behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind thi line of
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou
shalt bring thi father and thi mother and thi brethren and all thi
father household home unto thee

2:19 and it shall be that whosoev shall go out of the door of thi
hous into the street hi blood shall be upon hi head and we will
be guiltless: and whosoev shall be with thee in the hous hi blood
shall be on our head if ani hand be upon him

2:20 and if thou utter thi our busi then we will be quit of
thine oath which thou hast made us to swear

2:21 and she said accord unto your word so be it and she sent
them away and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the
window

2:22 and they went and came unto the mountain and abod there three
day until the pursuer were returned: and the pursuer sought them
throughout all the way but found them not

2:23 so the two men return and descend from the mountain and
pass over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all
thing that befel them: 2:24 and they said unto joshua truli the
lord hath deliv into our hand all the land; for even all the
inhabit of the countri do faint becaus of us

3:1 and joshua rose earli in the morning; and they remov from
shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and
lodg there befor they pass over

3:2 and it came to pass after three day that the offic went
through the host; 3:3 and they command the peopl say when ye
see the ark of the coven of the lord your god and the priest the
levit bear it then ye shall remov from your place and go after
it

3:4 yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand
cubit by measure: come not near unto it that ye may know the way by
which ye must go: for ye have not pass thi way heretofor

3:5 and joshua said unto the peopl sanctifi yourselves: for to
morrow the lord will do wonder among you

3:6 and joshua spake unto the priest say take up the ark of the
coven and pass over befor the peopl and they took up the ark of
the coven and went befor the peopl

3:7 and the lord said unto joshua thi day will i begin to magnifi
thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i wa
with mose so i will be with thee

3:8 and thou shalt command the priest that bear the ark of the
coven say when ye are come to the brink of the water of
jordan ye shall stand still in jordan

3:9 and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear
the word of the lord your god

3:10 and joshua said herebi ye shall know that the live god is
among you and that he will without fail drive out from befor you the
canaanit and the hittit and the hivit and the perizzit and
the girgashit and the amorit and the jebusit

3:11 behold the ark of the coven of the lord of all the earth
passeth over befor you into jordan

3:12 now therefor take you twelv men out of the tribe of israel
out of everi tribe a man

3:13 and it shall come to pass as soon as the sole of the feet of
the priest that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth
shall rest in the water of jordan that the water of jordan shall be
cut off from the water that come down from above; and they shall
stand upon an heap

3:14 and it came to pass when the peopl remov from their tent to
pass over jordan and the priest bear the ark of the coven
befor the people; 3:15 and as they that bare the ark were come unto
jordan and the feet of the priest that bare the ark were dip in
the brim of the water (for jordan overfloweth all hi bank all the
time of harvest) 3:16 that the water which came down from abov
stood and rose up upon an heap veri far from the citi adam that is
besid zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain
even the salt sea fail and were cut off: and the peopl pass
over right against jericho

3:17 and the priest that bare the ark of the coven of the lord
stood firm on dri ground in the midst of jordan and all the
israelit pass over on dri ground until all the peopl were pass
clean over jordan

4:1 and it came to pass when all the peopl were clean pass over
jordan that the lord spake unto joshua say 4:2 take you twelv
men out of the peopl out of everi tribe a man 4:3 and command ye
them say take you henc out of the midst of jordan out of the
place where the priest feet stood firm twelv stone and ye shall
carri them over with you and leav them in the lodg place where
ye shall lodg thi night

4:4 then joshua call the twelv men whom he had prepar of the
children of israel out of everi tribe a man: 4:5 and joshua said unto
them pass over befor the ark of the lord your god into the midst of
jordan and take you up everi man of you a stone upon hi shoulder
accord unto the number of the tribe of the children of israel: 4:6
that thi may be a sign among you that when your children ask their
father in time to come say what mean ye by these stones? 4:7
then ye shall answer them that the water of jordan were cut off
befor the ark of the coven of the lord; when it pass over
jordan the water of jordan were cut off: and these stone shall be
for a memori unto the children of israel for ever

4:8 and the children of israel did so as joshua command and took up
twelv stone out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto
joshua accord to the number of the tribe of the children of
israel and carri them over with them unto the place where they
lodg and laid them down there

4:9 and joshua set up twelv stone in the midst of jordan in the
place where the feet of the priest which bare the ark of the coven
stood: and they are there unto thi day

4:10 for the priest which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan
until everyth wa finish that the lord command joshua to speak
unto the peopl accord to all that mose command joshua: and the
peopl hast and pass over

4:11 and it came to pass when all the peopl were clean pass over
that the ark of the lord pass over and the priest in the presenc
of the peopl

4:12 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the
tribe of manasseh pass over arm befor the children of israel as
mose spake unto them: 4:13 about forti thousand prepar for war
pass over befor the lord unto battl to the plain of jericho

4:14 on that day the lord magnifi joshua in the sight of all israel;
and they fear him as they fear mose all the day of hi life

4:15 and the lord spake unto joshua say 4:16 command the priest
that bear the ark of the testimoni that they come up out of jordan

4:17 joshua therefor command the priest say come ye up out of
jordan

4:18 and it came to pass when the priest that bare the ark of the
coven of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the
sole of the priest feet were lift up unto the dri land that the
water of jordan return unto their place and flow over all hi
bank as they did befor

4:19 and the peopl came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the
first month and encamp in gilgal in the east border of jericho

4:20 and those twelv stone which they took out of jordan did
joshua pitch in gilgal

4:21 and he spake unto the children of israel say when your
children shall ask their father in time to come say what mean
these stones? 4:22 then ye shall let your children know say
israel came over thi jordan on dri land

4:23 for the lord your god dri up the water of jordan from befor
you until ye were pass over as the lord your god did to the red
sea which he dri up from befor us until we were gone over: 4:24
that all the peopl of the earth might know the hand of the lord that
it is mighty: that ye might fear the lord your god for ever

5:1 and it came to pass when all the king of the amorit which
were on the side of jordan westward and all the king of the
canaanit which were by the sea heard that the lord had dri up
the water of jordan from befor the children of israel until we were
pass over that their heart melt neither wa there spirit in them
ani more becaus of the children of israel

5:2 at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knive
and circumcis again the children of israel the second time

5:3 and joshua made him sharp knive and circumcis the children of
israel at the hill of the foreskin

5:4 and thi is the caus whi joshua did circumcise: all the peopl
that came out of egypt that were male even all the men of war die
in the wilder by the way after they came out of egypt

5:5 now all the peopl that came out were circumcised: but all the
peopl that were born in the wilder by the way as they came forth
out of egypt them they had not circumcis

5:6 for the children of israel walk forti year in the wilder
till all the peopl that were men of war which came out of egypt
were consum becaus they obey not the voic of the lord: unto
whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the
lord sware unto their father that he would give us a land that
floweth with milk and honey

5:7 and their children whom he rais up in their stead them joshua
circumcised: for they were uncircumcis becaus they had not
circumcis them by the way

5:8 and it came to pass when they had done circumcis all the
peopl that they abod in their place in the camp till they were
whole

5:9 and the lord said unto joshua thi day have i roll away the
reproach of egypt from off you wherefor the name of the place is
call gilgal unto thi day

5:10 and the children of israel encamp in gilgal and kept the
passov on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plain of
jericho

5:11 and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
the passov unleaven cake and parch corn in the selfsam day

5:12 and the manna ceas on the morrow after they had eaten of the
old corn of the land; neither had the children of israel manna ani
more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year

5:13 and it came to pass when joshua wa by jericho that he lift
up hi eye and look and behold there stood a man over against
him with hi sword drawn in hi hand: and joshua went unto him and
said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries? 5:14 and he
said nay; but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and
joshua fell on hi face to the earth and did worship and said unto
him what saith my lord unto hi servant? 5:15 and the captain of the
lord host said unto joshua loos thi shoe from off thi foot; for
the place whereon thou standest is holi and joshua did so

6:1 now jericho wa straitli shut up becaus of the children of
israel: none went out and none came in

6:2 and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand
jericho and the king thereof and the mighti men of valour

6:3 and ye shall compass the citi all ye men of war and go round
about the citi onc thu shalt thou do six day

6:4 and seven priest shall bear befor the ark seven trumpet of
ram horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the citi seven
time and the priest shall blow with the trumpet

6:5 and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with
the ram horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the
peopl shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the citi shall
fall down flat and the peopl shall ascend up everi man straight
befor him

6:6 and joshua the son of nun call the priest and said unto them
take up the ark of the coven and let seven priest bear seven
trumpet of ram horn befor the ark of the lord

6:7 and he said unto the peopl pass on and compass the citi and
let him that is arm pass on befor the ark of the lord

6:8 and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the peopl that
the seven priest bear the seven trumpet of ram horn pass on
befor the lord and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the
coven of the lord follow them

6:9 and the arm men went befor the priest that blew with the
trumpet and the rereward came after the ark the priest go on
and blow with the trumpet

6:10 and joshua had command the peopl say ye shall not shout
nor make ani nois with your voic neither shall ani word proceed out
of your mouth until the day i bid you shout; then shall ye shout

6:11 so the ark of the lord compass the citi go about it once:
and they came into the camp and lodg in the camp

6:12 and joshua rose earli in the morn and the priest took up the
ark of the lord

6:13 and seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram horn befor
the ark of the lord went on continu and blew with the trumpets:
and the arm men went befor them; but the rereward came after the
ark of the lord the priest go on and blow with the trumpet

6:14 and the second day they compass the citi onc and return
into the camp: so they did six day

6:15 and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose earli
about the dawn of the day and compass the citi after the same
manner seven times: onli on that day they compass the citi seven
time

6:16 and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew
with the trumpet joshua said unto the peopl shout; for the lord
hath given you the citi

6:17 and the citi shall be accurs even it and all that are
therein to the lord: onli rahab the harlot shall live she and all
that are with her in the hous becaus she hid the messeng that we
sent

6:18 and ye in ani wise keep yourselv from the accurs thing lest
ye make yourselv accurs when ye take of the accurs thing and
make the camp of israel a curs and troubl it

6:19 but all the silver and gold and vessel of brass and iron are
consecr unto the lord: they shall come into the treasuri of the
lord

6:20 so the peopl shout when the priest blew with the trumpets:
and it came to pass when the peopl heard the sound of the trumpet
and the peopl shout with a great shout that the wall fell down
flat so that the peopl went up into the citi everi man straight
befor him and they took the citi

6:21 and they utterli destroy all that wa in the citi both man and
woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edg of the
sword

6:22 but joshua had said unto the two men that had spi out the
countri go into the harlot hous and bring out thenc the woman
and all that she hath as ye sware unto her

6:23 and the young men that were spi went in and brought out rahab
and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she
had; and they brought out all her kindr and left them without the
camp of israel

6:24 and they burnt the citi with fire and all that wa therein: onli
the silver and the gold and the vessel of brass and of iron they
put into the treasuri of the hous of the lord

6:25 and joshua save rahab the harlot aliv and her father
household and all that she had; and she dwelleth in israel even unto
thi day; becaus she hid the messeng which joshua sent to spi out
jericho

6:26 and joshua adjur them at that time say curs be the man
befor the lord that riseth up and buildeth thi citi jericho: he
shall lay the foundat thereof in hi firstborn and in hi youngest
son shall he set up the gate of it

6:27 so the lord wa with joshua; and hi fame wa nois throughout
all the countri

7:1 but the children of israel commit a trespass in the accurs
thing: for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of
zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accurs thing: and the
anger of the lord wa kindl against the children of israel

7:2 and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is besid bethaven
on the east of bethel and spake unto them say go up and view the
countri

and the men went up and view ai

7:3 and they return to joshua and said unto him let not all the
peopl go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
ai; and make not all the peopl to labour thither; for they are but
few

7:4 so there went up thither of the peopl about three thousand men:
and they fled befor the men of ai

7:5 and the men of ai smote of them about thirti and six men: for they
chase them from befor the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in
the go down: wherefor the heart of the peopl melt and becam
as water

7:6 and joshua rent hi cloth and fell to the earth upon hi face
befor the ark of the lord until the eventid he and the elder of
israel and put dust upon their head

7:7 and joshua said ala o lord god wherefor hast thou at all
brought thi peopl over jordan to deliv us into the hand of the
amorit to destroy us? would to god we had been content and dwelt
on the other side jordan! 7:8 o lord what shall i say when israel
turneth their back befor their enemies! 7:9 for the canaanit and
all the inhabit of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us
round and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto
thi great name? 7:10 and the lord said unto joshua get thee up;
wherefor liest thou thu upon thi face? 7:11 israel hath sin and
they have also transgress my coven which i command them: for
they have even taken of the accurs thing and have also stolen and
dissembl also and they have put it even among their own stuff

7:12 therefor the children of israel could not stand befor their
enemi but turn their back befor their enemi becaus they
were accursed: neither will i be with you ani more except ye destroy
the accurs from among you

7:13 up sanctifi the peopl and say sanctifi yourselv against to
morrow: for thu saith the lord god of israel there is an accurs
thing in the midst of thee o israel: thou canst not stand befor
thine enemi until ye take away the accurs thing from among you

7:14 in the morn therefor ye shall be brought accord to your
tribes: and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall
come accord to the famili thereof; and the famili which the lord
shall take shall come by households; and the household which the lord
shall take shall come man by man

7:15 and it shall be that he that is taken with the accurs thing
shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath: becaus he hath
transgress the coven of the lord and becaus he hath wrought
folli in israel

7:16 so joshua rose up earli in the morn and brought israel by
their tribes; and the tribe of judah wa taken: 7:17 and he brought
the famili of judah; and he took the famili of the zarhites: and he

8:10 and joshua rose up earli in the morn and number the peopl

8:17 and there wa not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out

and took it and hast and set the citi on fire

8:20 and when the men of ai look behind them they saw and behold
the smoke of the citi ascend up to heaven and they had no power to

right unto thee to do unto us do

9:26 and so did he unto them and deliv them out of the hand of
the children of israel that they slew them not

9:27 and joshua made them that day hewer of wood and drawer of water
for the congreg and for the altar of the lord even unto thi
day in the place which he should choos

10:1 now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard
how joshua had taken ai and had utterli destroy it; as he had done
to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king; and how
the inhabit of gibeon had made peac with israel and were among
them; 10:2 that they fear greatli becaus gibeon wa a great citi
as one of the royal citi and becaus it wa greater than ai and
all the men thereof were mighti

10:3 wherefor adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of
hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of
lachish and unto debir king of eglon say 10:4 come up unto me
and help me that we may smite gibeon: for it hath made peac with

10:9 joshua therefor came unto them suddenli and went up from gilgal
all night

10:10 and the lord discomfit them befor israel and slew them with
a great slaughter at gibeon and chase them along the way that goeth

10:11 and it came to pass as they fled from befor israel and were
in the go down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stone
from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died: they were more which
die with hailston than they whom the children of israel slew with

10:12 then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord deliv

the valley of ajalon

10:13 and the sun stood still and the moon stay until the peopl

10:18 and joshua said roll great stone upon the mouth of the cave
and set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 and stay ye not but pursu
after your enemi and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to
enter into their cities: for the lord your god hath deliv them
into your hand

10:20 and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had

were consum that the rest which remain of them enter into
fenc citi

10:21 and all the peopl return to the camp to joshua at makkedah in

10:22 then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out
those five king unto me out of the cave

10:23 and they did so and brought forth those five king unto him out
of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of

also and the king thereof into the hand of israel; and he smote it
with the edg of the sword and all the soul that were therein; he
let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto

lord deliv lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the
second day and smote it with the edg of the sword and all the soul
that were therein accord to all that he had done to libnah

10:33 then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish; and joshua
smote him and hi peopl until he had left him none remain

10:34 and from lachish joshua pass unto eglon and all israel with

and utterli destroy all the soul that were therein; he left none

10:40 so joshua smote all the countri of the hill and of the south
and of the vale and of the spring and all their kings: he left none
remain but utterli destroy all that breath as the lord god of
israel command

10:41 and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all
the countri of goshen even unto gibeon

10:42 and all these king and their land did joshua take at one time
becaus the lord god of israel fought for israel

10:43 and joshua return and all israel with him unto the camp to
gilgal

11:1 and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those
thing that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of
shimron and to the king of achshaph 11:2 and to the king that were
on the north of the mountain and of the plain south of chinneroth
and in the valley and in the border of dor on the west 11:3 and to
the canaanit on the east and on the west and to the amorit and the
hittit and the perizzit and the jebusit in the mountain and to
the hivit under hermon in the land of mizpeh

11:4 and they went out they and all their host with them much
peopl even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitud with
hors and chariot veri mani

11:5 and when all these king were met togeth they came and pitch
togeth at the water of merom to fight against israel

11:6 and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid becaus of them: for
to morrow about thi time will i deliv them up all slain befor
israel: thou shalt hough their hors and burn their chariot with
fire

11:7 so joshua came and all the peopl of war with him against them
by the water of merom suddenly; and they fell upon them

11:8 and the lord deliv them into the hand of israel who smote
them and chase them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and
unto the valley of mizpeh eastward; and they smote them until they
left them none remain

11:9 and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him: he hough their
hors and burnt their chariot with fire

11:10 and joshua at that time turn back and took hazor and smote
the king thereof with the sword: for hazor beforetim wa the head of
all those kingdom

11:11 and they smote all the soul that were therein with the edg of
the sword utterli destroy them: there wa not ani left to breathe:
and he burnt hazor with fire

11:12 and all the citi of those king and all the king of them
did joshua take and smote them with the edg of the sword and he
utterli destroy them as mose the servant of the lord command

11:13 but as for the citi that stood still in their strength israel
burn none of them save hazor only; that did joshua burn

11:14 and all the spoil of these citi and the cattl the children
of israel took for a prey unto themselves; but everi man they smote
with the edg of the sword until they had destroy them neither
left they ani to breath

11:15 as the lord command mose hi servant so did mose command
joshua and so did joshua; he left noth undon of all that the lord
command mose

11:16 so joshua took all that land the hill and all the south
countri and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain
and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same; 11:17 even
from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the
valley of lebanon under mount hermon: and all their king he took and
smote them and slew them

11:18 joshua made war a long time with all those king

11:19 there wa not a citi that made peac with the children of
israel save the hivit the inhabit of gibeon: all other they
took in battl

11:20 for it wa of the lord to harden their heart that they should
come against israel in battl that he might destroy them utterli and
that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the
lord command mose

11:21 and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakim from the
mountain from hebron from debir from anab and from all the
mountain of judah and from all the mountain of israel: joshua
destroy them utterli with their citi

11:22 there wa none of the anakim left in the land of the children
of israel: onli in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remain

11:23 so joshua took the whole land accord to all that the lord
said unto moses; and joshua gave it for an inherit unto israel
accord to their divis by their tribe and the land rest from
war

12:1 now these are the king of the land which the children of israel

24:1 and joshua gather all the tribe of israel to shechem and
call for the elder of israel and for their head and for their
judg and for their officers; and they present themselv befor
god

24:2 and joshua said unto all the peopl thu saith the lord god of
israel your father dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time
even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor: and they
serv other god

24:3 and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood
and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multipli hi
seed and gave him isaac

24:4 and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau: and i gave unto esau mount
seir to possess it; but jacob and hi children went down into egypt

24:5 i sent mose also and aaron and i plagu egypt accord to
that which i did among them: and afterward i brought you out

24:6 and i brought your father out of egypt: and ye came unto the
sea; and the egyptian pursu after your father with chariot and
horsemen unto the red sea

24:7 and when they cri unto the lord he put dark between you
and the egyptian and brought the sea upon them and cover them;
and your eye have seen what i have done in egypt: and ye dwelt in the
wilder a long season

24:8 and i brought you into the land of the amorit which dwelt on
the other side jordan; and they fought with you: and i gave them into
your hand that ye might possess their land; and i destroy them from
befor you

24:9 then balak the son of zippor king of moab aros and war
against israel and sent and call balaam the son of beor to curs
you: 24:10 but i would not hearken unto balaam; therefor he bless
you still: so i deliv you out of hi hand

24:11 and you went over jordan and came unto jericho: and the men of
jericho fought against you the amorit and the perizzit and the
canaanit and the hittit and the girgashit the hivit and
the jebusites; and i deliv them into your hand

24:12 and i sent the hornet befor you which drave them out from
befor you even the two king of the amorites; but not with thi
sword nor with thi bow

24:13 and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and
citi which ye built not and ye dwell in them; of the vineyard and
oliveyard which ye plant not do ye eat

24:14 now therefor fear the lord and serv him in sincer and in
truth: and put away the god which your father serv on the other
side of the flood and in egypt; and serv ye the lord

24:15 and if it seem evil unto you to serv the lord choos you thi
day whom ye will serve; whether the god which your father serv
that were on the other side of the flood or the god of the amorit
in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my hous we will serv the
lord

24:16 and the peopl answer and said god forbid that we should
forsak the lord to serv other gods; 24:17 for the lord our god he
it is that brought us up and our father out of the land of egypt
from the hous of bondag and which did those great sign in our
sight and preserv us in all the way wherein we went and among all
the peopl through whom we passed: 24:18 and the lord drave out from
befor us all the peopl even the amorit which dwelt in the land:
therefor will we also serv the lord; for he is our god

24:19 and joshua said unto the peopl ye cannot serv the lord: for
he is an holi god; he is a jealou god; he will not forgiv your
transgress nor your sin

24:20 if ye forsak the lord and serv strang god then he will
turn and do you hurt and consum you after that he hath done you
good

24:21 and the peopl said unto joshua nay; but we will serv the
lord

24:22 and joshua said unto the peopl ye are wit against
yourselv that ye have chosen you the lord to serv him and they
said we are wit

24:23 now therefor put away said he the strang god which are
among you and inclin your heart unto the lord god of israel

24:24 and the peopl said unto joshua the lord our god will we serv
and hi voic will we obey

24:25 so joshua made a coven with the peopl that day and set them
a statut and an ordin in shechem

24:26 and joshua wrote these word in the book of the law of god and
took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that wa by the
sanctuari of the lord

24:27 and joshua said unto all the peopl behold thi stone shall be
a wit unto us; for it hath heard all the word of the lord which
he spake unto us: it shall be therefor a wit unto you lest ye
deni your god

24:28 so joshua let the peopl depart everi man unto hi inherit

24:29 and it came to pass after these thing that joshua the son of
nun the servant of the lord die be an hundr and ten year
old

24:30 and they buri him in the border of hi inherit in
timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill

1:1 now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children
of israel ask the lord say who shall go up for us against the

shall go up: behold i have deliv the land into hi hand

1:3 and judah said unto simeon hi brother come up with me into my
lot that we may fight against the canaanites; and i likewis will go
with thee into thi lot so simeon went with him

1:4 and judah went up; and the lord deliv the canaanit and the
perizzit into their hand: and they slew of them in bezek ten
thousand men

1:5 and they found adonibezek in bezek: and they fought against him
and they slew the canaanit and the perizzit

1:6 but adonibezek fled; and they pursu after him and caught him
and cut off hi thumb and hi great toe

1:7 and adonibezek said threescor and ten king have their thumb
and their great toe cut off gather their meat under my table: as i
have done so god hath requit me and they brought him to jerusalem
and there he die

1:8 now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had

1:16 and the children of the kenit mose father in law went up out
of the citi of palm tree with the children of judah into the

1:17 and judah went with simeon hi brother and they slew the
canaanit that inhabit zephath and utterli destroy it and the

1:18 also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the

1:19 and the lord wa with judah; and he drave out the inhabit of
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabit of the valley
becaus they had chariot of iron

1:20 and they gave hebron unto caleb as mose said: and he expel

1:27 neither did manasseh drive out the inhabit of bethshean and
her town nor taanach and her town nor the inhabit of dor and
her town nor the inhabit of ibleam and her town nor the

1:28 and it came to pass when israel wa strong that they put the
canaanit to tribut and did not utterli drive them out

1:29 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanit that dwelt in gezer;
but the canaanit dwelt in gezer among them

1:34 and the amorit forc the children of dan into the mountain:
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 1:35 but
the amorit would dwell in mount here in aijalon and in shaalbim:
yet the hand of the hous of joseph prevail so that they becam
tributari

1:36 and the coast of the amorit wa from the go up to akrabbim
from the rock and upward

2:1 and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said
i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land

2:2 and ye shall make no leagu with the inhabit of thi land; ye

2:13 and they forsook the lord and serv baal and ashtaroth

2:14 and the anger of the lord wa hot against israel and he
deliv them into the hand of spoiler that spoil them and he
sold them into the hand of their enemi round about so that they
could not ani longer stand befor their enemi

2:15 whithersoev they went out the hand of the lord wa against
them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto
them: and they were greatli distress

2:16 nevertheless the lord rais up judg which deliv them out
of the hand of those that spoil them

2:17 and yet they would not hearken unto their judg but they went a
whore after other god and bow themselv unto them: they turn
quickli out of the way which their father walk in obey the
command of the lord; but they did not so

2:18 and when the lord rais them up judg then the lord wa with
the judg and deliv them out of the hand of their enemi all the
day of the judge: for it repent the lord becaus of their groan
by reason of them that oppress them and vex them

2:19 and it came to pass when the judg wa dead that they return
and corrupt themselv more than their father in follow other
god to serv them and to bow down unto them; they ceas not from
their own do nor from their stubborn way

2:20 and the anger of the lord wa hot against israel; and he said
becaus that thi peopl hath transgress my coven which i
command their father and have not hearken unto my voice; 2:21 i
also will not henceforth drive out ani from befor them of the nation
which joshua left when he died: 2:22 that through them i may prove
israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as
their father did keep it or not

2:23 therefor the lord left those nation without drive them out
hastily; neither deliv he them into the hand of joshua

3:1 now these are the nation which the lord left to prove israel by
them even as mani of israel as had not known all the war of canaan;
3:2 onli that the gener of the children of israel might know to
teach them war at the least such as befor knew noth thereof; 3:3
name five lord of the philistin and all the canaanit and the
sidonian and the hivit that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount
baalhermon unto the enter in of hamath

3:4 and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would
hearken unto the command of the lord which he command their
father by the hand of mose

3:5 and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanit hittit
and amorit and perizzit and hivit and jebusites: 3:6 and they
took their daughter to be their wive and gave their daughter to
their son and serv their god

3:7 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and
forgat the lord their god and serv baalim and the grove

3:8 therefor the anger of the lord wa hot against israel and he
sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia: and
the children of israel serv chushanrishathaim eight year

3:9 and when the children of israel cri unto the lord the lord
rais up a deliver to the children of israel who deliv them
even othniel the son of kenaz caleb younger brother

3:10 and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judg israel
and went out to war: and the lord deliv chushanrishathaim king of
mesopotamia into hi hand; and hi hand prevail against
chushanrishathaim

3:11 and the land had rest forti year and othniel the son of kenaz
die

3:12 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord: and the lord strengthen eglon the king of moab against israel
becaus they had done evil in the sight of the lord

3:13 and he gather unto him the children of ammon and amalek and
went and smote israel and possess the citi of palm tree

3:14 so the children of israel serv eglon the king of moab eighteen
year

3:15 but when the children of israel cri unto the lord the lord
rais them up a deliver ehud the son of gera a benjamit a man
lefthanded: and by him the children of israel sent a present unto
eglon the king of moab

3:16 but ehud made him a dagger which had two edg of a cubit
length; and he did gird it under hi raiment upon hi right thigh

3:17 and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab: and eglon wa
a veri fat man

3:18 and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away
the peopl that bare the present

3:19 but he himself turn again from the quarri that were by
gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king: who said
keep silenc and all that stood by him went out from him

3:20 and ehud came unto him; and he wa sit in a summer parlour
which he had for himself alon and ehud said i have a messag from
god unto thee

and he aros out of hi seat

3:21 and ehud put forth hi left hand and took the dagger from hi
right thigh and thrust it into hi belly: 3:22 and the haft also went
in after the blade; and the fat close upon the blade so that he
could not draw the dagger out of hi belly; and the dirt came out

3:23 then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the door of the
parlour upon him and lock them

3:24 when he wa gone out hi servant came; and when they saw that
behold the door of the parlour were lock they said sure he
covereth hi feet in hi summer chamber

3:25 and they tarri till they were ashamed: and behold he open
not the door of the parlour; therefor they took a key and open
them: and behold their lord wa fallen down dead on the earth

3:26 and ehud escap while they tarri and pass beyond the
quarri and escap unto seirath

3:27 and it came to pass when he wa come that he blew a trumpet in
the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him
from the mount and he befor them

3:28 and he said unto them follow after me: for the lord hath
deliv your enemi the moabit into your hand and they went down
after him and took the ford of jordan toward moab and suffer not
a man to pass over

3:29 and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all
lusti and all men of valour; and there escap not a man

3:30 so moab wa subdu that day under the hand of israel and the
land had rest fourscor year

3:31 and after him wa shamgar the son of anath which slew of the
philistin six hundr men with an ox goad: and he also deliv
israel

4:1 and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the
lord when ehud wa dead

4:2 and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that
reign in hazor; the captain of whose host wa sisera which dwelt in
harosheth of the gentil

4:3 and the children of israel cri unto the lord: for he had nine
hundr chariot of iron; and twenti year he mightili oppress the
children of israel

4:4 and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judg israel
at that time

4:5 and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and
bethel in mount ephraim: and the children of israel came up to her for
judgment

4:6 and she sent and call barak the son of abinoam out of
kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel
command say go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of
zebulun? 4:7 and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera
the captain of jabin armi with hi chariot and hi multitude; and
i will deliv him into thine hand

4:8 and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go:
but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go

4:9 and she said i will sure go with thee: notwithstand the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the lord
shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah aros and
went with barak to kedesh

4:10 and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh; and he went up
with ten thousand men at hi feet: and deborah went up with him

4:11 now heber the kenit which wa of the children of hobab the
father in law of mose had sever himself from the kenit and
pitch hi tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh

4:12 and they shew sisera that barak the son of abinoam wa gone up
to mount tabor

4:13 and sisera gather togeth all hi chariot even nine hundr
chariot of iron and all the peopl that were with him from
harosheth of the gentil unto the river of kishon

4:14 and deborah said unto barak up; for thi is the day in which the
lord hath deliv sisera into thine hand: is not the lord gone out
befor thee? so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men
after him

4:15 and the lord discomfit sisera and all hi chariot and all
hi host with the edg of the sword befor barak; so that sisera
light down off hi chariot and fled away on hi feet

4:16 but barak pursu after the chariot and after the host unto
harosheth of the gentiles: and all the host of sisera fell upon the
edg of the sword; and there wa not a man left

4:17 howbeit sisera fled away on hi feet to the tent of jael the wife
of heber the kenite: for there wa peac between jabin the king of
hazor and the hous of heber the kenit

4:18 and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my
lord turn in to me; fear not and when he had turn in unto her into
the tent she cover him with a mantl

4:19 and he said unto her give me i pray thee a littl water to
drink; for i am thirsti and she open a bottl of milk and gave him
drink and cover him

4:20 again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it
shall be when ani man doth come and enquir of thee and say is
there ani man here? that thou shalt say no

4:21 then jael heber wife took a nail of the tent and took an
hammer in her hand and went softli unto him and smote the nail into
hi templ and fasten it into the ground: for he wa fast asleep
and weari so he die

4:22 and behold as barak pursu sisera jael came out to meet him
and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and
the nail wa in hi templ

4:23 so god subdu on that day jabin the king of canaan befor the
children of israel

4:24 and the hand of the children of israel prosper and prevail
against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroy jabin king
of canaan

5:1 then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day
say 5:2 prais ye the lord for the aveng of israel when the
peopl willingli offer themselv

5:3 hear o ye kings; give ear o ye princes; i even i will sing

5:4 lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of
the field of edom the earth trembl and the heaven drop the
cloud also drop water

5:5 the mountain melt from befor the lord even that sinai from

5:6 in the day of shamgar the son of anath in the day of jael the
highway were unoccupi and the travel walk through byway

5:7 the inhabit of the villag ceas they ceas in israel
until that i deborah aros that i aros a mother in israel

5:8 they chose new gods; then wa war in the gates: wa there a shield
or spear seen among forti thousand in israel? 5:9 my heart is toward
the governor of israel that offer themselv willingli among the
peopl bless ye the lord

5:10 speak ye that ride on white ass ye that sit in judgment and

5:11 they that are deliv from the nois of archer in the place
of draw water there shall they rehears the righteou act of the
lord even the righteou act toward the inhabit of hi villag
in israel: then shall the peopl of the lord go down to the gate

5:12 awak awak deborah: awak awak utter a song: aris barak
and lead thi captiv captiv thou son of abinoam

5:13 then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobl
among the people: the lord made me have dominion over the mighti

5:14 out of ephraim wa there a root of them against amalek; after
thee benjamin among thi people; out of machir came down governor
and out of zebulun they that handl the pen of the writer

5:15 and the princ of issachar were with deborah; even issachar and
also barak: he wa sent on foot into the valley for the divis of
reuben there were great thought of heart

5:16 whi abodest thou among the sheepfold to hear the bleat of
the flocks? for the divis of reuben there were great search of
heart

5:17 gilead abod beyond jordan: and whi did dan remain in ships?
asher continu on the sea shore and abod in hi breach

5:18 zebulun and naphtali were a peopl that jeopard their live
unto the death in the high place of the field

5:19 the king came and fought then fought the king of canaan in
taanach by the water of megiddo; they took no gain of money

5:20 they fought from heaven; the star in their cours fought
against sisera

5:21 the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the
river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength

5:22 then were the horsehoof broken by the mean of the prans
the prans of their mighti one

5:23 curs ye meroz said the angel of the lord curs ye bitterli the
inhabit thereof; becaus they came not to the help of the lord to
the help of the lord against the mighti

5:24 bless abov women shall jael the wife of heber the kenit be
bless shall she be abov women in the tent

5:25 he ask water and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter
in a lordli dish

5:26 she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen
hammer; and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off hi head
when she had pierc and stricken through hi templ

5:27 at her feet he bow he fell he lay down: at her feet he bow
he fell: where he bow there he fell down dead

5:28 the mother of sisera look out at a window and cri through
the lattic whi is hi chariot so long in coming? whi tarri the
wheel of hi chariots? 5:29 her wise ladi answer her yea she
return answer to herself 5:30 have they not sped? have they not
divid the prey; to everi man a damsel or two; to sisera a prey of
diver colour a prey of diver colour of needlework of diver
colour of needlework on both side meet for the neck of them that
take the spoil? 5:31 so let all thine enemi perish o lord: but let
them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in hi might and
the land had rest forti year

6:1 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord: and
the lord deliv them into the hand of midian seven year

6:2 and the hand of midian prevail against israel: and becaus of
the midianit the children of israel made them the den which are in
the mountain and cave and strong hold

6:3 and so it wa when israel had sown that the midianit came up
and the amalekit and the children of the east even they came up
against them; 6:4 and they encamp against them and destroy the
increas of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no
susten for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass

6:5 for they came up with their cattl and their tent and they came
as grasshopp for multitude; for both they and their camel were
without number: and they enter into the land to destroy it

6:6 and israel wa greatli impoverish becaus of the midianites; and
the children of israel cri unto the lord

6:7 and it came to pass when the children of israel cri unto the
lord becaus of the midianit 6:8 that the lord sent a prophet unto
the children of israel which said unto them thu saith the lord god
of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of
the hous of bondage; 6:9 and i deliv you out of the hand of the
egyptian and out of the hand of all that oppress you and drave
them out from befor you and gave you their land; 6:10 and i said
unto you i am the lord your god; fear not the god of the amorit
in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obey my voic

6:11 and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which
wa in ophrah that pertain unto joash the abiezrite: and hi son
gideon thresh wheat by the winepress to hide it from the
midianit

6:12 and the angel of the lord appear unto him and said unto him
the lord is with thee thou mighti man of valour

6:13 and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us whi
then is all thi befallen us? and where be all hi miracl which our
father told us of say did not the lord bring us up from egypt?
but now the lord hath forsaken us and deliv us into the hand of
the midianit

6:14 and the lord look upon him and said go in thi thi might and
thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites: have not i
sent thee? 6:15 and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i
save israel? behold my famili is poor in manasseh and i am the
least in my father hous

6:16 and the lord said unto him sure i will be with thee and thou
shalt smite the midianit as one man

6:17 and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thi sight
then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me

6:18 depart not henc i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring
forth my present and set it befor thee and he said i will tarri
until thou come again

6:19 and gideon went in and made readi a kid and unleaven cake of
an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth
in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and present it

6:20 and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the
unleaven cake and lay them upon thi rock and pour out the broth
and he did so

6:21 then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that
wa in hi hand and touch the flesh and the unleaven cakes; and
there rose up fire out of the rock and consum the flesh and the
unleaven cake then the angel of the lord depart out of hi
sight

6:22 and when gideon perceiv that he wa an angel of the lord
gideon said ala o lord god! for becaus i have seen an angel of the
lord face to face

6:23 and the lord said unto him peac be unto thee; fear not: thou
shalt not die

6:24 then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and call it
jehovahshalom: unto thi day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrit

6:25 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him
take thi father young bullock even the second bullock of seven
year old and throw down the altar of baal that thi father hath and
cut down the grove that is by it: 6:26 and build an altar unto the
lord thi god upon the top of thi rock in the order place and take
the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrific with the wood of the
grove which thou shalt cut down

6:27 then gideon took ten men of hi servant and did as the lord had
said unto him: and so it wa becaus he fear hi father
household and the men of the citi that he could not do it by day
that he did it by night

6:28 and when the men of the citi aros earli in the morn behold
the altar of baal wa cast down and the grove wa cut down that wa
by it and the second bullock wa offer upon the altar that wa
built

6:29 and they said one to anoth who hath done thi thing? and when
they enquir and ask they said gideon the son of joash hath done
thi thing

6:30 then the men of the citi said unto joash bring out thi son that
he may die: becaus he hath cast down the altar of baal and becaus
he hath cut down the grove that wa by it

6:31 and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for
baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him let him be put to
death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god let him plead for
himself becaus one hath cast down hi altar

6:32 therefor on that day he call him jerubba say let baal
plead against him becaus he hath thrown down hi altar

6:33 then all the midianit and the amalekit and the children of
the east were gather togeth and went over and pitch in the
valley of jezreel

6:34 but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a
trumpet; and abiez wa gather after him

6:35 and he sent messeng throughout all manasseh; who also wa
gather after him: and he sent messeng unto asher and unto
zebulun and unto naphtali; and they came up to meet them

6:36 and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand
as thou hast said 6:37 behold i will put a fleec of wool in the
floor; and if the dew be on the fleec onli and it be dri upon all
the earth besid then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine
hand as thou hast said

6:38 and it wa so: for he rose up earli on the morrow and thrust the
fleec togeth and wring the dew out of the fleec a bowl full of
water

6:39 and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me
and i will speak but thi once: let me prove i pray thee but thi
onc with the fleece; let it now be dri onli upon the fleec and upon
all the ground let there be dew

6:40 and god did so that night: for it wa dri upon the fleec onli
and there wa dew on all the ground

7:1 then jerubba who is gideon and all the peopl that were with
him rose up earli and pitch besid the well of harod: so that the
host of the midianit were on the north side of them by the hill of
moreh in the valley

7:2 and the lord said unto gideon the peopl that are with thee are
too mani for me to give the midianit into their hand lest israel
vaunt themselv against me say mine own hand hath save me

7:3 now therefor go to proclaim in the ear of the peopl say
whosoev is fear and afraid let him return and depart earli from
mount gilead and there return of the peopl twenti and two
thousand; and there remain ten thousand

7:4 and the lord said unto gideon the peopl are yet too many; bring
them down unto the water and i will tri them for thee there: and it
shall be that of whom i say unto thee thi shall go with thee the
same shall go with thee; and of whomsoev i say unto thee thi shall
not go with thee the same shall not go

7:5 so he brought down the peopl unto the water: and the lord said
unto gideon everi one that lappeth of the water with hi tongu as a
dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself; likewis everi one that
boweth down upon hi knee to drink

7:6 and the number of them that lap put their hand to their
mouth were three hundr men: but all the rest of the peopl bow
down upon their knee to drink water

7:7 and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundr men that
lap will i save you and deliv the midianit into thine hand:
and let all the other peopl go everi man unto hi place

7:8 so the peopl took victual in their hand and their trumpets: and
he sent all the rest of israel everi man unto hi tent and retain
those three hundr men: and the host of midian wa beneath him in the
valley

7:9 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him
aris get thee down unto the host; for i have deliv it into thine
hand

7:10 but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thi servant down
to the host: 7:11 and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward
shall thine hand be strengthen to go down unto the host then went
he down with phurah hi servant unto the outsid of the arm men that
were in the host

7:12 and the midianit and the amalekit and all the children of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshopp for multitude; and
their camel were without number as the sand by the sea side for
multitud

7:13 and when gideon wa come behold there wa a man that told a
dream unto hi fellow and said behold i dream a dream and lo a
cake of barley bread tumbl into the host of midian and came unto a
tent and smote it that it fell and overturn it that the tent lay
along

7:14 and hi fellow answer and said thi is noth els save the
sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel: for into hi hand
hath god deliv midian and all the host

7:15 and it wa so when gideon heard the tell of the dream and
the interpret thereof that he worship and return into the
host of israel and said arise; for the lord hath deliv into your
hand the host of midian

7:16 and he divid the three hundr men into three compani and he
put a trumpet in everi man hand with empti pitcher and lamp
within the pitcher

7:17 and he said unto them look on me and do likewise: and behold
when i come to the outsid of the camp it shall be that as i do so
shall ye do

7:18 when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow
ye the trumpet also on everi side of all the camp and say the sword
of the lord and of gideon

7:19 so gideon and the hundr men that were with him came unto the
outsid of the camp in the begin of the middl watch; and they had
but newli set the watch: and they blew the trumpet and brake the
pitcher that were in their hand

7:20 and the three compani blew the trumpet and brake the
pitcher and held the lamp in their left hand and the trumpet in
their right hand to blow withal: and they cri the sword of the
lord and of gideon

7:21 and they stood everi man in hi place round about the camp; and
all the host ran and cri and fled

7:22 and the three hundr blew the trumpet and the lord set everi
man sword against hi fellow even throughout all the host: and the
host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of
abelmeholah unto tabbath

7:23 and the men of israel gather themselv togeth out of
naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursu after
the midianit

7:24 and gideon sent messeng throughout all mount ephraim say

8:1 and the men of ephraim said unto him whi hast thou serv us
thu that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the
midianites? and they did chide with him sharpli

8:2 and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you?
is not the glean of the grape of ephraim better than the vintag
of abiezer? 8:3 god hath deliv into your hand the princ of
midian oreb and zeeb: and what wa i abl to do in comparison of you?
then their anger wa abat toward him when he had said that

8:4 and gideon came to jordan and pass over he and the three
hundr men that were with him faint yet pursu them

8:5 and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loav of

8:6 and the princ of succoth said are the hand of zebah and
zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army?
8:7 and gideon said therefor when the lord hath deliv zebah and
zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorn
of the wilder and with brier

8:8 and he went up thenc to penuel and spake unto them likewise: and
the men of penuel answer him as the men of succoth had answer him

8:9 and he spake also unto the men of penuel say when i come

8:10 now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their host with them
about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the host of the
children of the east: for there fell an hundr and twenti thousand
men that drew sword

8:11 and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tent on the

and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thi men
that are weary? 8:16 and he took the elder of the citi and thorn
of the wilder and brier and with them he taught the men of
succoth

8:17 and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the
citi

8:18 then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were
they whom ye slew at tabor? and they answer as thou art so were
they; each one resembl the children of a king

8:19 and he said they were my brethren even the son of my mother:
as the lord liveth if ye had save them aliv i would not slay you

8:20 and he said unto jether hi firstborn up and slay them but the
youth drew not hi sword: for he fear becaus he wa yet a youth

8:21 then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us: for as
the man is so is hi strength and gideon aros and slew zebah and
zalmunna and took away the ornament that were on their camel
neck

8:22 then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both
thou and thi son and thi son son also: for thou hast deliv us
from the hand of midian

8:23 and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither
shall my son rule over you: the lord shall rule over you

8:24 and gideon said unto them i would desir a request of you that
ye would give me everi man the ear of hi prey (for they had
golden ear becaus they were ishmaelites) 8:25 and they
answer we will willingli give them and they spread a garment and
did cast therein everi man the ear of hi prey

8:26 and the weight of the golden ear that he request wa a
thousand and seven hundr shekel of gold; besid ornament and
collar and purpl raiment that wa on the king of midian and
besid the chain that were about their camel neck

8:27 and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in hi citi even in
ophrah: and all israel went thither a whore after it: which thing
becam a snare unto gideon and to hi hous

8:28 thu wa midian subdu befor the children of israel so that
they lift up their head no more and the countri wa in quiet
forti year in the day of gideon

8:29 and jerubba the son of joash went and dwelt in hi own hous

8:30 and gideon had threescor and ten son of hi bodi begotten: for
he had mani wive

8:31 and hi concubin that wa in shechem she also bare him a son
whose name he call abimelech

8:32 and gideon the son of joash die in a good old age and wa
buri in the sepulchr of joash hi father in ophrah of the
abiezrit

8:33 and it came to pass as soon as gideon wa dead that the
children of israel turn again and went a whore after baalim and
made baalberith their god

8:34 and the children of israel rememb not the lord their god who
had deliv them out of the hand of all their enemi on everi
side: 8:35 neither shew they kind to the hous of jerubba
name gideon accord to all the good which he had shew unto
israel

9:1 and abimelech the son of jerubba went to shechem unto hi
mother brethren and commun with them and with all the famili of
the hous of hi mother father say 9:2 speak i pray you in
the ear of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either
that all the son of jerubba which are threescor and ten person
reign over you or that one reign over you? rememb also that i am
your bone and your flesh

9:3 and hi mother brethren spake of him in the ear of all the men
of shechem all these words: and their heart inclin to follow
abimelech; for they said he is our brother

9:4 and they gave him threescor and ten piec of silver out of the
hous of baalberith wherewith abimelech hire vain and light person

9:5 and he went unto hi father hous at ophrah and slew hi
brethren the son of jerubba be threescor and ten person upon
one stone: notwithstand yet jotham the youngest son of jerubba
wa left; for he hid himself

9:6 and all the men of shechem gather togeth and all the hous of
millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar
that wa in shechem

9:7 and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of
mount gerizim and lift up hi voic and cri and said unto them
hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you

9:8 the tree went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
they said unto the oliv tree reign thou over us

9:9 but the oliv tree said unto them should i leav my fat
wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promot over
the trees? 9:10 and the tree said to the fig tree come thou and
reign over us

9:11 but the fig tree said unto them should i forsak my sweet
and my good fruit and go to be promot over the trees? 9:12 then
said the tree unto the vine come thou and reign over us

9:13 and the vine said unto them should i leav my wine which
cheereth god and man and go to be promot over the trees? 9:14 then
said all the tree unto the brambl come thou and reign over us

9:15 and the brambl said unto the tree if in truth ye anoint me
king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not
let fire come out of the brambl and devour the cedar of lebanon

9:16 now therefor if ye have done truli and sincer in that ye
have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubba and
hi hous and have done unto him accord to the deserv of hi
hands; 9:17 (for my father fought for you and adventur hi life
far and deliv you out of the hand of midian: 9:18 and ye are
risen up against my father hous thi day and have slain hi son
threescor and ten person upon one stone and have made abimelech
the son of hi maidserv king over the men of shechem becaus he
is your brother;) 9:19 if ye then have dealt truli and sincer with
jerubba and with hi hous thi day then rejoic ye in abimelech
and let him also rejoic in you: 9:20 but if not let fire come out
from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the hous of millo;
and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the hous of
millo and devour abimelech

9:21 and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there
for fear of abimelech hi brother

9:22 when abimelech had reign three year over israel 9:23 then god
sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem; and the
men of shechem dealt treacher with abimelech: 9:24 that the
cruelti done to the threescor and ten son of jerubba might come
and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them;
and upon the men of shechem which aid him in the kill of hi
brethren

9:25 and the men of shechem set lier in wait for him in the top of
the mountain and they rob all that came along that way by them:
and it wa told abimelech

9:26 and gaal the son of ebe came with hi brethren and went over to
shechem: and the men of shechem put their confid in him

9:27 and they went out into the field and gather their vineyard
and trode the grape and made merri and went into the hous of their
god and did eat and drink and curs abimelech

9:28 and gaal the son of ebe said who is abimelech and who is
shechem that we should serv him? is not he the son of jerubbaal? and
zebul hi officer? serv the men of hamor the father of shechem: for
whi should we serv him? 9:29 and would to god thi peopl were under
my hand! then would i remov abimelech and he said to abimelech
increas thine armi and come out

9:30 and when zebul the ruler of the citi heard the word of gaal the
son of ebe hi anger wa kindl

9:31 and he sent messeng unto abimelech privili say behold
gaal the son of ebe and hi brethren be come to shechem; and behold
they fortifi the citi against thee

9:32 now therefor up by night thou and the peopl that is with thee

morn as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise earli and set upon
the city: and behold when he and the peopl that is with him come
out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find
occas

9:34 and abimelech rose up and all the peopl that were with him by
night and they laid wait against shechem in four compani

9:35 and gaal the son of ebe went out and stood in the enter of
the gate of the city: and abimelech rose up and the peopl that were
with him from lie in wait

9:36 and when gaal saw the peopl he said to zebul behold there
come peopl down from the top of the mountain and zebul said unto
him thou seest the shadow of the mountain as if they were men

9:37 and gaal spake again and said see there come peopl down by the
middl of the land and anoth compani come along by the plain of
meonenim

9:38 then said zebul unto him where is now thi mouth wherewith thou
saidst who is abimelech that we should serv him? is not thi the
peopl that thou hast despised? go out i pray now and fight with
them

9:39 and gaal went out befor the men of shechem and fought with
abimelech

9:40 and abimelech chase him and he fled befor him and mani were
overthrown and wound even unto the enter of the gate

9:41 and abimelech dwelt at arumah: and zebul thrust out gaal and hi
brethren that they should not dwell in shechem

9:42 and it came to pass on the morrow that the peopl went out into
the field; and they told abimelech

9:43 and he took the peopl and divid them into three compani
and laid wait in the field and look and behold the peopl were
come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them and smote
them

9:44 and abimelech and the compani that wa with him rush forward
and stood in the enter of the gate of the city: and the two other
compani ran upon all the peopl that were in the field and slew
them

9:45 and abimelech fought against the citi all that day; and he took
the citi and slew the peopl that wa therein and beat down the
citi and sow it with salt

9:46 and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they
enter into an hold of the hous of the god berith

9:47 and it wa told abimelech that all the men of the tower of
shechem were gather togeth

9:48 and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the peopl
that were with him; and abimelech took an axe in hi hand and cut
down a bough from the tree and took it and laid it on hi shoulder
and said unto the peopl that were with him what ye have seen me do
make hast and do as i have done

9:49 and all the peopl likewis cut down everi man hi bough and
follow abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire
upon them; so that all the men of the tower of shechem die also
about a thousand men and women

9:50 then went abimelech to thebez and encamp against thebez and
took it

9:51 but there wa a strong tower within the citi and thither fled
all the men and women and all they of the citi and shut it to them
and gat them up to the top of the tower

9:52 and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and
went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire

9:53 and a certain woman cast a piec of a millston upon abimelech
head and all to brake hi skull

9:54 then he call hastili unto the young man hi armourbear and
said unto him draw thi sword and slay me that men say not of me a
women slew him and hi young man thrust him through and he die

9:55 and when the men of israel saw that abimelech wa dead they
depart everi man unto hi place

9:56 thu god render the wicked of abimelech which he did unto
hi father in slay hi seventi brethren: 9:57 and all the evil of
the men of shechem did god render upon their heads: and upon them came
the curs of jotham the son of jerubba

10:1 and after abimelech there aros to defend israel tola the son of
puah the son of dodo a man of issachar; and he dwelt in shamir in
mount ephraim

10:2 and he judg israel twenti and three year and die and wa
buri in shamir

10:3 and after him aros jair a gileadit and judg israel twenti
and two year

10:4 and he had thirti son that rode on thirti ass colt and they
had thirti citi which are call havothjair unto thi day which
are in the land of gilead

10:5 and jair die and wa buri in camon

10:6 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord and serv baalim and ashtaroth and the god of syria and the
god of zidon and the god of moab and the god of the children of
ammon and the god of the philistin and forsook the lord and
serv not him

10:7 and the anger of the lord wa hot against israel and he sold
them into the hand of the philistin and into the hand of the
children of ammon

10:8 and that year they vex and oppress the children of israel:
eighteen year all the children of israel that were on the other side
jordan in the land of the amorit which is in gilead

10:9 moreov the children of ammon pass over jordan to fight also
against judah and against benjamin and against the hous of ephraim;
so that israel wa sore distress

10:10 and the children of israel cri unto the lord say we have
sin against thee both becaus we have forsaken our god and also
serv baalim

10:11 and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliv
you from the egyptian and from the amorit from the children of
ammon and from the philistines? 10:12 the zidonian also and the
amalekit and the maonit did oppress you; and ye cri to me and
i deliv you out of their hand

10:13 yet ye have forsaken me and serv other gods: wherefor i will
deliv you no more

10:14 go and cri unto the god which ye have chosen; let them deliv
you in the time of your tribul

10:15 and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned:
do thou unto us whatsoev seemeth good unto thee; deliv us onli we
pray thee thi day

10:16 and they put away the strang god from among them and serv
the lord: and hi soul wa griev for the miseri of israel

10:17 then the children of ammon were gather togeth and encamp
in gilead and the children of israel assembl themselv togeth
and encamp in mizpeh

10:18 and the peopl and princ of gilead said one to anoth what
man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon? he
shall be head over all the inhabit of gilead

11:1 now jephthah the gileadit wa a mighti man of valour and he wa
the son of an harlot: and gilead begat jephthah

11:2 and gilead wife bare him sons; and hi wife son grew up and
they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in
our father house; for thou art the son of a strang woman

11:3 then jephthah fled from hi brethren and dwelt in the land of
tob: and there were gather vain men to jephthah and went out with
him

11:4 and it came to pass in process of time that the children of
ammon made war against israel

11:5 and it wa so that when the children of ammon made war against
israel the elder of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of
tob: 11:6 and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that
we may fight with the children of ammon

11:7 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead did not ye hate me
and expel me out of my father house? and whi are ye come unto me now
when ye are in distress? 11:8 and the elder of gilead said unto
jephthah therefor we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go
with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over
all the inhabit of gilead

11:9 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead if ye bring me home
again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliv
them befor me shall i be your head? 11:10 and the elder of gilead
said unto jephthah the lord be wit between us if we do not so
accord to thi word

11:11 then jephthah went with the elder of gilead and the peopl
made him head and captain over them: and jephthah utter all hi
word befor the lord in mizpeh

11:12 and jephthah sent messeng unto the king of the children of
ammon say what hast thou to do with me that thou art come
against me to fight in my land? 11:13 and the king of the children of
ammon answer unto the messeng of jephthah becaus israel took
away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto
jabbok and unto jordan: now therefor restor those land again
peaceabl

11:14 and jephthah sent messeng again unto the king of the children
of ammon: 11:15 and said unto him thu saith jephthah israel took
not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon:
11:16 but when israel came up from egypt and walk through the
wilder unto the red sea and came to kadesh; 11:17 then israel
sent messeng unto the king of edom say let me i pray thee
pass through thi land: but the king of edom would not hearken thereto
and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab: but he would not
consent: and israel abod in kadesh

11:18 then they went along through the wilder and compass the
land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the
land of moab and pitch on the other side of arnon but came not
within the border of moab: for arnon wa the border of moab

11:19 and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit the
king of heshbon; and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee
through thi land into my place

11:20 but sihon trust not israel to pass through hi coast: but
sihon gather all hi peopl togeth and pitch in jahaz and
fought against israel

11:21 and the lord god of israel deliv sihon and all hi peopl
into the hand of israel and they smote them: so israel possess all
the land of the amorit the inhabit of that countri

11:22 and they possess all the coast of the amorit from arnon
even unto jabbok and from the wilder even unto jordan

11:23 so now the lord god of israel hath dispossess the amorit
from befor hi peopl israel and shouldest thou possess it? 11:24
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thi god giveth thee to
possess? so whomsoev the lord our god shall drive out from befor
us them will we possess

11:25 and now art thou ani thing better than balak the son of zippor
king of moab? did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight
against them 11:26 while israel dwelt in heshbon and her town and
in aroer and her town and in all the citi that be along by the
coast of arnon three hundr years? whi therefor did ye not recov
them within that time? 11:27 wherefor i have not sin against
thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the lord the judg be
judg thi day between the children of israel and the children of
ammon

11:28 howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearken not unto the
word of jephthah which he sent him

11:29 then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he pass
over gilead and manasseh and pass over mizpeh of gilead and from
mizpeh of gilead he pass over unto the children of ammon

11:30 and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt
without fail deliv the children of ammon into mine hand 11:31 then
it shall be that whatsoev cometh forth of the door of my hous to
meet me when i return in peac from the children of ammon shall
sure be the lord and i will offer it up for a burnt offer

11:32 so jephthah pass over unto the children of ammon to fight
against them; and the lord deliv them into hi hand

11:33 and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith
even twenti citi and unto the plain of the vineyard with a veri
great slaughter thu the children of ammon were subdu befor the
children of israel

11:34 and jephthah came to mizpeh unto hi hous and behold hi
daughter came out to meet him with timbrel and with dances: and she
wa hi onli child; besid her he had neither son nor daughter

11:35 and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent hi cloth
and said ala my daughter! thou hast brought me veri low and thou
art one of them that troubl me: for i have open my mouth unto the
lord and i cannot go back

11:36 and she said unto him my father if thou hast open thi mouth
unto the lord do to me accord to that which hath proceed out of
thi mouth; forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeanc for thee of
thine enemi even of the children of ammon

11:37 and she said unto her father let thi thing be done for me: let
me alon two month that i may go up and down upon the mountain and
bewail my virgin i and my fellow

11:38 and he said go and he sent her away for two months: and she
went with her companion and bewail her virgin upon the
mountain

11:39 and it came to pass at the end of two month that she return
unto her father who did with her accord to hi vow which he had
vowed: and she knew no man and it wa a custom in israel 11:40 that
the daughter of israel went yearli to lament the daughter of jephthah
the gileadit four day in a year

12:1 and the men of ephraim gather themselv togeth and went
northward and said unto jephthah wherefor passedst thou over to
fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with
thee? we will burn thine hous upon thee with fire

12:2 and jephthah said unto them i and my peopl were at great strife
with the children of ammon; and when i call you ye deliv me not
out of their hand

12:3 and when i saw that ye deliv me not i put my life in my
hand and pass over against the children of ammon and the lord
deliv them into my hand: wherefor then are ye come up unto me
thi day to fight against me? 12:4 then jephthah gather togeth
all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim: and the men of gilead
smote ephraim becaus they said ye gileadit are fugit of
ephraim among the ephraimit and among the manassit

12:5 and the gileadit took the passag of jordan befor the
ephraimites: and it wa so that when those ephraimit which were
escap said let me go over; that the men of gilead said unto him
art thou an ephraimite? if he said nay; 12:6 then said they unto him
say now shibboleth: and he said sibboleth: for he could not frame to
pronounc it right then they took him and slew him at the passag
of jordan: and there fell at that time of the ephraimit forti and
two thousand

12:7 and jephthah judg israel six year then die jephthah the
gileadit and wa buri in one of the citi of gilead

12:8 and after him ibzan of bethlehem judg israel

12:9 and he had thirti son and thirti daughter whom he sent

judg israel seven year

12:10 then die ibzan and wa buri at bethlehem

12:11 and after him elon a zebulonit judg israel; and he judg

12:12 and elon the zebulonit die and wa buri in aijalon in the
countri of zebulun

12:13 and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonit judg

12:14 and he had forti son and thirti nephew that rode on
threescor and ten ass colts: and he judg israel eight year

12:15 and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonit die and wa buri
in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekit

13:1 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord; and the lord deliv them into the hand of the philistin
forti year

13:2 and there wa a certain man of zorah of the famili of the
danit whose name wa manoah; and hi wife wa barren and bare not

13:3 and the angel of the lord appear unto the woman and said unto
her behold now thou art barren and bearest not: but thou shalt
conceiv and bear a son

13:4 now therefor bewar i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong
drink and eat not ani unclean thing: 13:5 for lo thou shalt
conceiv and bear a son; and no razor shall come on hi head: for the
child shall be a nazarit unto god from the womb: and he shall begin
to deliv israel out of the hand of the philistin

13:6 then the woman came and told her husband say a man of god
came unto me and hi counten wa like the counten of an angel
of god veri terrible: but i ask him not whenc he wa neither told
he me hi name: 13:7 but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceiv
and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat
ani unclean thing: for the child shall be a nazarit to god from the
womb to the day of hi death

13:8 then manoah intreat the lord and said o my lord let the man
of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we
shall do unto the child that shall be born

13:9 and god hearken to the voic of manoah; and the angel of god
came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but manoah her
husband wa not with her

13:10 and the woman made hast and ran and shew her husband and
said unto him behold the man hath appear unto me that came unto
me the other day

13:11 and manoah aros and went after hi wife and came to the man
and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? and
he said i am

13:12 and manoah said now let thi word come to pass how shall we
order the child and how shall we do unto him? 13:13 and the angel of
the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her
bewar

13:14 she may not eat of ani thing that cometh of the vine neither
let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat ani unclean thing: all
that i command her let her observ

13:15 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us
detain thee until we shall have made readi a kid for thee

13:16 and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain
me i will not eat of thi bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt
offer thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that
he wa an angel of the lord

13:17 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thi name
that when thi say come to pass we may do thee honour? 13:18 and
the angel of the lord said unto him whi askest thou thu after my
name see it is secret? 13:19 so manoah took a kid with a meat
offer and offer it upon a rock unto the lord: and the angel did
wonderously; and manoah and hi wife look on

13:20 for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from
off the altar that the angel of the lord ascend in the flame of the
altar and manoah and hi wife look on it and fell on their face
to the ground

13:21 but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to
hi wife then manoah knew that he wa an angel of the lord

13:22 and manoah said unto hi wife we shall sure die becaus we
have seen god

13:23 but hi wife said unto him if the lord were pleas to kill us
he would not have receiv a burnt offer and a meat offer at our
hand neither would he have shew us all these thing nor would as
at thi time have told us such thing as these

13:24 and the woman bare a son and call hi name samson: and the
child grew and the lord bless him

13:25 and the spirit of the lord began to move him at time in the
camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol

14:1 and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of
the daughter of the philistin

14:2 and he came up and told hi father and hi mother and said i
have seen a woman in timnath of the daughter of the philistines: now
therefor get her for me to wife

14:3 then hi father and hi mother said unto him is there never a
woman among the daughter of thi brethren or among all my peopl
that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcis philistines? and
samson said unto hi father get her for me; for she pleaseth me well

14:4 but hi father and hi mother knew not that it wa of the lord
that he sought an occas against the philistines: for at that time
the philistin had dominion over israel

14:5 then went samson down and hi father and hi mother to timnath
and came to the vineyard of timnath: and behold a young lion roar
against him

14:6 and the spirit of the lord came mightili upon him and he rent
him as he would have rent a kid and he had noth in hi hand: but
he told not hi father or hi mother what he had done

14:11 and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirti
companion to be with him

14:12 and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddl unto

14:18 and the men of the citi said unto him on the seventh day befor

sister fairer than she? take her i pray thee instead of her

15:3 and samson said concern them now shall i be more blameless

15:4 and samson went and caught three hundr fox and took

and given her to hi companion and the philistin came up and burnt
her and her father with fire

15:7 and samson said unto them though ye have done thi yet will i
be aveng of you and after that i will ceas

15:8 and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam

15:9 then the philistin went up and pitch in judah and spread
themselv in lehi

15:10 and the men of judah said whi are ye come up against us? and
they answer to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath

15:11 then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock
etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistin are
ruler over us? what is thi that thou hast done unto us? and he said
unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them

15:12 and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we
may deliv thee into the hand of the philistin and samson said
unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselv

15:13 and they spake unto him say no; but we will bind thee fast
and deliv thee into their hand: but sure we will not kill thee
and they bound him with two new cord and brought him up from the

and the spirit of the lord came mightili upon him and the cord that

15:18 and he wa sore athirst and call on the lord and said thou

16:7 and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green with

16:16 and it came to pass when she press him daili with her word
and urg him so that hi soul wa vex unto death; 16:17 that he

becom weak and be like ani other man

16:18 and when delilah saw that he had told her all hi heart she
sent and call for the lord of the philistin say come up thi

philistin came up unto her and brought money in their hand

16:19 and she made him sleep upon her knees; and she call for a man

grind in the prison hous

16:22 howbeit the hair of hi head began to grow again after he wa

16:23 then the lord of the philistin gather them togeth for to

said our god hath deliv samson our enemi into our hand

16:24 and when the peopl saw him they prais their god: for they

destroy of our countri which slew mani of us

16:25 and it came to pass when their heart were merri that they

16:26 and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer
me that i may feel the pillar whereupon the hous standeth that i
may lean upon them

16:27 now the hous wa full of men and women; and all the lord of

16:29 and samson took hold of the two middl pillar upon which the
hous stood and on which it wa born up of the one with hi right
hand and of the other with hi left

16:30 and samson said let me die with the philistin and he bow
himself with all hi might; and the hous fell upon the lord and
upon all the peopl that were therein so the dead which he slew at
hi death were more than they which he slew in hi life

16:31 then hi brethren and all the hous of hi father came down and
took him and brought him up and buri him between zorah and eshtaol
in the buryingplac of manoah hi father and he judg israel twenti
year

17:1 and there wa a man of mount ephraim whose name wa micah

17:13 then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good
see i have a levit to my priest

18:1 in those day there wa no king in israel: and in those day the
tribe of the danit sought them an inherit to dwell in; for unto
that day all their inherit had not fallen unto them among the
tribe of israel

18:2 and the children of dan sent of their famili five men from their
coast men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spi out the
land and to search it; and they said unto them go search the land:
who when they came to mount ephraim to the hous of micah they

18:3 when they were by the hous of micah they knew the voic of the
young man the levite: and they turn in thither and said unto him

hast thou here? 18:4 and he said unto them thu and thu dealeth
micah with me and hath hire me and i am hi priest

18:5 and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that
we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosper

18:6 and the priest said unto them go in peace: befor the lord is
your way wherein ye go

18:7 then the five men depart and came to laish and saw the peopl
that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the
zidonian quiet and secure; and there wa no magistr in the land
that might put them to shame in ani thing; and they were far from the
zidonian and had no busi with ani man

18:8 and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol: and their
brethren said unto them what say ye? 18:9 and they said aris that
we may go up against them: for we have seen the land and behold it
is veri good: and are ye still? be not sloth to go and to enter to
possess the land

18:10 when ye go ye shall come unto a peopl secur and to a larg
land: for god hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no
want of ani thing that is in the earth

18:11 and there went from thenc of the famili of the danit out of
zorah and out of eshtaol six hundr men appoint with weapon of
war

18:12 and they went up and pitch in kirjathjearim in judah:
wherefor they call that place mahanehdan unto thi day: behold it
is behind kirjathjearim

18:13 and they pass thenc unto mount ephraim and came unto the
hous of micah

18:14 then answer the five men that went to spi out the countri of
laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these
hous an ephod and teraphim and a graven imag and a molten image?
now therefor consid what ye have to do

18:15 and they turn thitherward and came to the hous of the young

18:16 and the six hundr men appoint with their weapon of war
which were of the children of dan stood by the enter of the gate

18:17 and the five men that went to spi out the land went up and came
in thither and took the graven imag and the ephod and the
teraphim and the molten image: and the priest stood in the enter
of the gate with the six hundr men that were appoint with weapon
of war

18:18 and these went into micah hous and fetch the carv imag
the ephod and the teraphim and the molten imag then said the
priest unto them what do ye? 18:19 and they said unto him hold thi
peac lay thine hand upon thi mouth and go with us and be to us a
father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the
hous of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a famili
in israel? 18:20 and the priest heart wa glad and he took the
ephod and the teraphim and the graven imag and went in the midst
of the peopl

18:21 so they turn and depart and put the littl one and the
cattl and the carriag befor them

18:22 and when they were a good way from the hous of micah the men
that were in the hous near to micah hous were gather togeth
and overtook the children of dan

18:23 and they cri unto the children of dan and they turn their
face and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with
such a company? 18:24 and he said ye have taken away my god which i
made and the priest and ye are gone away: and what have i more? and
what is thi that ye say unto me what aileth thee? 18:25 and the
children of dan said unto him let not thi voic be heard among us
lest angri fellow run upon thee and thou lose thi life with the
live of thi household

18:26 and the children of dan went their way: and when micah saw that
they were too strong for him he turn and went back unto hi hous

18:27 and they took the thing which micah had made and the priest
which he had and came unto laish unto a peopl that were at quiet
and secure: and they smote them with the edg of the sword and burnt
the citi with fire

18:28 and there wa no deliver becaus it wa far from zidon and
they had no busi with ani man; and it wa in the valley that lieth
by bethrehob and they built a citi and dwelt therein

18:29 and they call the name of the citi dan after the name of dan
their father who wa born unto israel: howbeit the name of the citi
wa laish at the first

18:30 and the children of dan set up the graven image: and jonathan

19:6 and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together:
for the damsel father had said unto the man be content i pray

19:13 and he said unto hi servant come and let us draw near to one

and came unto the hous of god and wept and sat there befor the
lord and fast that day until even and offer burnt offer and
peac offer befor the lord

20:27 and the children of israel enquir of the lord (for the ark of
the coven of god wa there in those day 20:28 and phineha the
son of eleazar the son of aaron stood befor it in those days)
say shall i yet again go out to battl against the children of
benjamin my brother or shall i cease? and the lord said go up; for
to morrow i will deliv them into thine hand

20:29 and israel set lier in wait round about gibeah

20:30 and the children of israel went up against the children of
benjamin on the third day and put themselv in array against gibeah
as at other time

20:31 and the children of benjamin went out against the peopl and
were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the peopl
and kill as at other time in the highway of which one goeth up to
the hous of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirti
men of israel

20:32 and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down befor
us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and
draw them from the citi unto the highway

20:33 and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put
themselv in array at baaltamar: and the lier in wait of israel came
forth out of their place even out of the meadow of gibeah

20:34 and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
israel and the battl wa sore: but they knew not that evil wa near
them

20:35 and the lord smote benjamin befor israel: and the children of
israel destroy of the benjamit that day twenti and five thousand
and an hundr men: all these drew the sword

20:36 so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the
men of israel gave place to the benjamit becaus they trust unto
the lier in wait which they had set besid gibeah

20:37 and the lier in wait hast and rush upon gibeah; and the
lier in wait drew themselv along and smote all the citi with the
edg of the sword

20:38 now there wa an appoint sign between the men of israel and
the lier in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise
up out of the citi

20:39 and when the men of israel retir in the battl benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirti persons: for they
said sure they are smitten down befor us as in the first battl

20:40 but when the flame began to aris up out of the citi with a
pillar of smoke the benjamit look behind them and behold the
flame of the citi ascend up to heaven

20:41 and when the men of israel turn again the men of benjamin
were amazed: for they saw that evil wa come upon them

20:42 therefor they turn their back befor the men of israel unto
the way of the wilderness; but the battl overtook them; and them
which came out of the citi they destroy in the midst of them

20:43 thu they inclos the benjamit round about and chase them
and trode them down with eas over against gibeah toward the
sunris

20:44 and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were
men of valour

20:45 and they turn and fled toward the wilder unto the rock of
rimmon: and they glean of them in the highway five thousand men;
and pursu hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of
them

20:46 so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenti and five
thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour

20:47 but six hundr men turn and fled to the wilder unto the
rock rimmon and abod in the rock rimmon four month

20:48 and the men of israel turn again upon the children of
benjamin and smote them with the edg of the sword as well the men
of everi citi as the beast and all that came to hand: also they set
on fire all the citi that they came to

21:1 now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh say there shall
not ani of us give hi daughter unto benjamin to wife

21:2 and the peopl came to the hous of god and abod there till
even befor god and lift up their voic and wept sore; 21:3 and
said o lord god of israel whi is thi come to pass in israel that
there should be to day one tribe lack in israel? 21:4 and it came
to pass on the morrow that the peopl rose earli and built there an
altar and offer burnt offer and peac offer

21:5 and the children of israel said who is there among all the
tribe of israel that came not up with the congreg unto the lord?
for they had made a great oath concern him that came not up to the
lord to mizpeh say he shall sure be put to death

21:6 and the children of israel repent them for benjamin their
brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel thi day

21:7 how shall we do for wive for them that remain see we have
sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughter to
wives? 21:8 and they said what one is there of the tribe of israel
that came not up to mizpeh to the lord? and behold there came none
to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembl

21:9 for the peopl were number and behold there were none of the
inhabit of jabeshgilead there

21:10 and the congreg sent thither twelv thousand men of the
valiantest and command them say go and smite the inhabit
of jabeshgilead with the edg of the sword with the women and the
children

21:11 and thi is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterli destroy
everi male and everi woman that hath lain by man

21:12 and they found among the inhabit of jabeshgilead four
hundr young virgin that had known no man by lie with ani male:
and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of
canaan

21:13 and the whole congreg sent some to speak to the children of
benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceabl unto
them

21:14 and benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wive
which they had save aliv of the women of jabeshgilead: and yet so
they suffic them not

21:15 and the peopl repent them for benjamin becaus that the lord
had made a breach in the tribe of israel

21:16 then the elder of the congreg said how shall we do for
wive for them that remain see the women are destroy out of
benjamin? 21:17 and they said there must be an inherit for them
that be escap of benjamin that a tribe be not destroy out of
israel

21:18 howbeit we may not give them wive of our daughters: for the
children of israel have sworn say curs be he that giveth a wife
to benjamin

21:19 then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh
yearli in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east
side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the
south of lebonah

21:20 therefor they command the children of benjamin say go
and lie in wait in the vineyards; 21:21 and see and behold if the
daughter of shiloh come out to danc in danc then come ye out of
the vineyard and catch you everi man hi wife of the daughter of
shiloh and go to the land of benjamin

21:22 and it shall be when their father or their brethren come unto
us to complain that we will say unto them be favour unto them
for our sakes: becaus we reserv not to each man hi wife in the
war: for ye did not give unto them at thi time that ye should be
guilti

21:23 and the children of benjamin did so and took them wive
accord to their number of them that danc whom they caught: and
they went and return unto their inherit and repair the
citi and dwelt in them

21:24 and the children of israel depart thenc at that time everi
man to hi tribe and to hi famili and they went out from thenc
everi man to hi inherit

21:25 in those day there wa no king in israel: everi man did that
which wa right in hi own eye

1:1 now it came to pass in the day when the judg rule that there

1:6 then she aros with her daughter in law that she might return

1:7 wherefor she went forth out of the place where she wa and her
two daughter in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto
the land of judah

1:8 and naomi said unto her two daughter in law go return each to
her mother house: the lord deal kindli with you as ye have dealt

1:9 the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the hous

1:10 and they said unto her sure we will return with thee unto thi
peopl

1:11 and naomi said turn again my daughters: whi will ye go with me?
are there yet ani more son in my womb that they may be your
husbands? 1:12 turn again my daughter go your way; for i am too
old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have
an husband also to night and should also bear sons; 1:13 would ye
tarri for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from
have husbands? nay my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your
sake that the hand of the lord is gone out against me

1:14 and they lift up their voic and wept again: and orpah kiss
her mother in law; but ruth clave unto her

1:15 and she said behold thi sister in law is gone back unto her
peopl and unto her gods: return thou after thi sister in law

1:16 and ruth said intreat me not to leav thee or to return from

thou lodgest i will lodge: thi peopl shall be my peopl and thi god
my god: 1:17 where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried:
the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and
me

1:18 when she saw that she wa stedfastli mind to go with her then
she left speak unto her

1:19 so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to
pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the citi wa move
about them and they said is thi naomi? 1:20 and she said unto
them call me not naomi call me mara: for the almighti hath dealt
veri bitterli with me

1:21 i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty:
whi then call ye me naomi see the lord hath testifi against me
and the almighti hath afflict me? 1:22 so naomi return and ruth

the countri of moab: and they came to bethlehem in the begin of
barley harvest

2:1 and naomi had a kinsman of her husband a mighti man of wealth
of the famili of elimelech; and hi name wa boaz

2:2 and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the
field and glean ear of corn after him in whose sight i shall find
grace

and she said unto her go my daughter

2:3 and she went and came and glean in the field after the
reapers: and her hap wa to light on a part of the field belong
unto boaz who wa of the kindr of elimelech

2:4 and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reaper
the lord be with you and they answer him the lord bless thee

2:5 then said boaz unto hi servant that wa set over the reaper
whose damsel is this? 2:6 and the servant that wa set over the
reaper answer and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back
with naomi out of the countri of moab: 2:7 and she said i pray you
let me glean and gather after the reaper among the sheaves: so she
came and hath continu even from the morn until now that she
tarri a littl in the hous

2:8 then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter? go not to
glean in anoth field neither go from henc but abid here fast by
my maidens: 2:9 let thine eye be on the field that they do reap and
go thou after them: have i not charg the young men that they shall
not touch thee? and when thou art athirst go unto the vessel and
drink of that which the young men have drawn

2:10 then she fell on her face and bow herself to the ground and
said unto him whi have i found grace in thine eye that thou
shouldest take knowledg of me see i am a stranger? 2:11 and boaz
answer and said unto her it hath fulli been shew me all that
thou hast done unto thi mother in law sinc the death of thine
husband: and how thou hast left thi father and thi mother and the
land of thi nativ and art come unto a peopl which thou knewest
not heretofor

2:12 the lord recompens thi work and a full reward be given thee of
the lord god of israel under whose wing thou art come to trust

2:13 then she said let me find favour in thi sight my lord; for that
thou hast comfort me and for that thou hast spoken friendli unto
thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaiden

2:14 and boaz said unto her at mealtim come thou hither and eat of
the bread and dip thi morsel in the vinegar and she sat besid the
reapers: and he reach her parch corn and she did eat and wa
suffic and left

2:15 and when she wa risen up to glean boaz command hi young men
say let her glean even among the sheav and reproach her not:
2:16 and let fall also some of the hand of purpos for her and
leav them that she may glean them and rebuk her not

2:17 so she glean in the field until even and beat out that she had
gleaned: and it wa about an ephah of barley

2:18 and she took it up and went into the city: and her mother in law
saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that

2:19 and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou glean to
day? and where wroughtest thou? bless be he that did take knowledg
of thee and she shew her mother in law with whom she had wrought
and said the man name with whom i wrought to day is boaz

2:20 and naomi said unto her daughter in law bless be he of the
lord who hath not left off hi kind to the live and to the
dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of
our next kinsmen

2:21 and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt
keep fast by my young men until they have end all my harvest

2:22 and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my
daughter that thou go out with hi maiden that they meet thee not
in ani other field

2:23 so she kept fast by the maiden of boaz to glean unto the end of
barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law

3:1 then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i
not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee? 3:2 and now is
not boaz of our kindr with whose maiden thou wast? behold he
winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor

3:3 wash thyself therefor and anoint thee and put thi raiment upon
thee and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto
the man until he shall have done eat and drink

3:4 and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the
place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncov hi feet
and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do

3:5 and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do

3:6 and she went down unto the floor and did accord to all that
her mother in law bade her

3:7 and when boaz had eaten and drunk and hi heart wa merri he
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softli
and uncov hi feet and laid her down

3:8 and it came to pass at midnight that the man wa afraid and
turn himself: and behold a woman lay at hi feet

3:9 and he said who art thou? and she answer i am ruth thine
handmaid: spread therefor thi skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art
a near kinsman

3:10 and he said bless be thou of the lord my daughter: for thou
hast shew more kind in the latter end than at the begin
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich

3:11 and now my daughter fear not; i will do to thee all that thou
requirest: for all the citi of my peopl doth know that thou art a
virtuou woman

3:12 and now it is true that i am thi near kinsman: howbeit there is a
kinsman nearer than i

3:13 tarri thi night and it shall be in the morn that if he will
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well; let him do the
kinsman part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee
then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth: lie
down until the morn

3:14 and she lay at hi feet until the morning: and she rose up befor
one could know anoth and he said let it not be known that a woman
came into the floor

3:15 also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold
it

and when she held it he measur six measur of barley and laid it
on her: and she went into the citi

3:16 and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou
my daughter? and she told her all that the man had done to her

3:17 and she said these six measur of barley gave he me; for he
said to me go not empti unto thi mother in law

3:18 then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the
matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest until he have
finish the thing thi day

4:1 then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there: and
behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by; unto whom he said ho
such a one! turn asid sit down here and he turn asid and sat
down

4:2 and he took ten men of the elder of the citi and said sit ye
down here and they sat down

4:3 and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the
countri of moab selleth a parcel of land which wa our brother
elimelechs: 4:4 and i thought to advertis thee say buy it
befor the inhabit and befor the elder of my peopl if thou
wilt redeem it redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell
me that i may know: for there is none to redeem it besid thee; and i
am after thee and he said i will redeem it

4:5 then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of
naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the
dead to rais up the name of the dead upon hi inherit

4:6 and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar
mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for i cannot
redeem it

4:7 now thi wa the manner in former time in israel concern
redeem and concern chang for to confirm all things; a man
pluck off hi shoe and gave it to hi neighbour: and thi wa a
testimoni in israel

4:8 therefor the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew
off hi shoe

4:9 and boaz said unto the elder and unto all the peopl ye are
wit thi day that i have bought all that wa elimelech and
all that wa chilion and mahlon of the hand of naomi

4:10 moreov ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchas
to be my wife to rais up the name of the dead upon hi inherit
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among hi brethren and
from the gate of hi place: ye are wit thi day

4:11 and all the peopl that were in the gate and the elder said
we are wit the lord make the woman that is come into thine
hous like rachel and like leah which two did build the hous of
israel: and do thou worthili in ephratah and be famou in bethlehem:
4:12 and let thi hous be like the hous of pharez whom tamar bare
unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of thi young
woman

4:13 so boaz took ruth and she wa hi wife: and when he went in unto
her the lord gave her concept and she bare a son

4:14 and the women said unto naomi bless be the lord which hath
not left thee thi day without a kinsman that hi name may be famou
in israel

4:15 and he shall be unto thee a restor of thi life and a nourish
of thine old age: for thi daughter in law which loveth thee which is
better to thee than seven son hath born him

4:16 and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and becam
nurs unto it

4:17 and the women her neighbour gave it a name say there is a
son born to naomi; and they call hi name obed: he is the father of
jess the father of david

1:1 now there wa a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim
and hi name wa elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the
son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite: 1:2 and he had two wives;
the name of the one wa hannah and the name of the other peninnah:
and peninnah had children but hannah had no children

1:3 and thi man went up out of hi citi yearli to worship and to
sacrific unto the lord of host in shiloh and the two son of eli
hophni and phineha the priest of the lord were there

1:4 and when the time wa that elkanah offer he gave to peninnah
hi wife and to all her son and her daughter portions: 1:5 but
unto hannah he gave a worthi portion; for he love hannah: but the
lord had shut up her womb

1:6 and her adversari also provok her sore for to make her fret
becaus the lord had shut up her womb

1:7 and as he did so year by year when she went up to the hous of
the lord so she provok her; therefor she wept and did not eat

1:8 then said elkanah her husband to her hannah whi weepest thou?
and whi eatest thou not? and whi is thi heart grieved? am not i better
to thee than ten sons? 1:9 so hannah rose up after they had eaten in
shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat
by a post of the templ of the lord

1:10 and she wa in bitter of soul and pray unto the lord and
wept sore

1:11 and she vow a vow and said o lord of host if thou wilt
inde look on the afflict of thine handmaid and rememb me and
not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child then i will give him unto the lord all the day of hi life
and there shall no razor come upon hi head

1:12 and it came to pass as she continu pray befor the lord
that eli mark her mouth

1:13 now hannah she spake in her heart; onli her lip move but her
voic wa not heard: therefor eli thought she had been drunken

1:14 and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken? put away
thi wine from thee

1:15 and hannah answer and said no my lord i am a woman of a
sorrow spirit: i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have
pour out my soul befor the lord

1:16 count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial: for out of the
abund of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto

1:17 then eli answer and said go in peace: and the god of israel
grant thee thi petit that thou hast ask of him

1:18 and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thi sight so the
woman went her way and did eat and her counten wa no more sad

1:19 and they rose up in the morn earli and worship befor the
lord and return and came to their hous to ramah: and elkanah knew
hannah hi wife; and the lord rememb her

1:20 wherefor it came to pass when the time wa come about after
hannah had conceiv that she bare a son and call hi name samuel
say becaus i have ask him of the lord

1:21 and the man elkanah and all hi hous went up to offer unto the
lord the yearli sacrific and hi vow

1:22 but hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband i will not
go up until the child be wean and then i will bring him that he
may appear befor the lord and there abid for ever

1:23 and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good;
tarri until thou have wean him; onli the lord establish hi word so
the woman abod and gave her son suck until she wean him

1:24 and when she had wean him she took him up with her with three
bullock and one ephah of flour and a bottl of wine and brought
him unto the hous of the lord in shiloh: and the child wa young

1:25 and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli

1:26 and she said oh my lord as thi soul liveth my lord i am the
woman that stood by thee here pray unto the lord

1:27 for thi child i prayed; and the lord hath given me my petit
which i ask of him: 1:28 therefor also i have lent him to the lord;
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worship
the lord there

2:1 and hannah pray and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine
horn is exalt in the lord: my mouth is enlarg over mine enemies;
becaus i rejoic in thi salvat

2:2 there is none holi as the lord: for there is none besid thee:
neither is there ani rock like our god

2:3 talk no more so exceed proudly; let not arrog come out of
your mouth: for the lord is a god of knowledg and by him action are
weigh

2:4 the bow of the mighti men are broken and they that stumbl are
gird with strength

2:5 they that were full have hire out themselv for bread; and they
that were hungri ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she
that hath mani children is wax feebl

2:6 the lord killeth and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave
and bringeth up

2:7 the lord maketh poor and maketh rich: he bringeth low and
lifteth up

2:8 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghil to set them among princ and to make them inherit
the throne of glory: for the pillar of the earth are the lord and
he hath set the world upon them

2:9 he will keep the feet of hi saint and the wick shall be
silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail

2:10 the adversari of the lord shall be broken to pieces; out of
heaven shall he thunder upon them: the lord shall judg the end of
the earth; and he shall give strength unto hi king and exalt the
horn of hi anoint

2:11 and elkanah went to ramah to hi hous and the child did
minist unto the lord befor eli the priest

2:12 now the son of eli were son of belial; they knew not the lord

2:13 and the priest custom with the peopl wa that when ani man
offer sacrific the priest servant came while the flesh wa in
seeth with a fleshhook of three teeth in hi hand; 2:14 and he
struck it into the pan or kettl or caldron or pot; all that the
fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in
shiloh unto all the israelit that came thither

2:15 also befor they burnt the fat the priest servant came and
said to the man that sacrif give flesh to roast for the priest;
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw

2:16 and if ani man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat
present and then take as much as thi soul desireth; then he would
answer him nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not i will
take it by forc

2:17 wherefor the sin of the young men wa veri great befor the
lord: for men abhor the offer of the lord

2:18 but samuel minist befor the lord be a child gird with
a linen ephod

2:19 moreov hi mother made him a littl coat and brought it to him
from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearli sacrific

2:20 and eli bless elkanah and hi wife and said the lord give
thee seed of thi woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and
they went unto their own home

2:21 and the lord visit hannah so that she conceiv and bare
three son and two daughter and the child samuel grew befor the
lord

2:22 now eli wa veri old and heard all that hi son did unto all
israel; and how they lay with the women that assembl at the door of
the tabernacl of the congreg

2:23 and he said unto them whi do ye such things? for i hear of your
evil deal by all thi peopl

2:24 nay my sons; for it is no good report that i hear: ye make the
lord peopl to transgress

2:25 if one man sin against anoth the judg shall judg him: but if
a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him? notwithstand
they hearken not unto the voic of their father becaus the lord
would slay them

2:26 and the child samuel grew on and wa in favour both with the
lord and also with men

2:27 and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thu
saith the lord did i plainli appear unto the hous of thi father
when they were in egypt in pharaoh house? 2:28 and did i choos him
out of all the tribe of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine
altar to burn incens to wear an ephod befor me? and did i give
unto the hous of thi father all the offer made by fire of the
children of israel? 2:29 wherefor kick ye at my sacrific and at
mine offer which i have command in my habitation; and honourest
thi son abov me to make yourselv fat with the chiefest of all the
offer of israel my people? 2:30 wherefor the lord god of israel
saith i said inde that thi hous and the hous of thi father
should walk befor me for ever: but now the lord saith be it far from
me; for them that honour me i will honour and they that despis me
shall be lightli esteem

2:31 behold the day come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm
of thi father hous that there shall not be an old man in thine
hous

2:32 and thou shalt see an enemi in my habit in all the wealth
which god shall give israel: and there shall not be an old man in
thine hous for ever

2:33 and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar
shall be to consum thine eye and to griev thine heart: and all the
increas of thine hous shall die in the flower of their age

2:34 and thi shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thi two
son on hophni and phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them

2:35 and i will rais me up a faith priest that shall do accord
to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and i will build him a
sure house; and he shall walk befor mine anoint for ever

2:36 and it shall come to pass that everi one that is left in thine
hous shall come and crouch to him for a piec of silver and a morsel
of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priest
offic that i may eat a piec of bread

3:1 and the child samuel minist unto the lord befor eli and the
word of the lord wa preciou in those days; there wa no open vision

3:2 and it came to pass at that time when eli wa laid down in hi
place and hi eye began to wax dim that he could not see; 3:3 and
ere the lamp of god went out in the templ of the lord where the ark
of god wa and samuel wa laid down to sleep; 3:4 that the lord
call samuel: and he answer here am i

3:5 and he ran unto eli and said here am i; for thou calledst me
and he said i call not; lie down again and he went and lay down

3:6 and the lord call yet again samuel and samuel aros and went
to eli and said here am i; for thou didst call me and he answer
i call not my son; lie down again

3:7 now samuel did not yet know the lord neither wa the word of the
lord yet reveal unto him

3:8 and the lord call samuel again the third time and he aros and
went to eli and said here am i; for thou didst call me and eli
perceiv that the lord had call the child

3:9 therefor eli said unto samuel go lie down: and it shall be if
he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord; for thi servant
heareth so samuel went and lay down in hi place

3:10 and the lord came and stood and call as at other time
samuel samuel then samuel answer speak; for thi servant heareth

3:11 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel
at which both the ear of everi one that heareth it shall tingl

3:12 in that day i will perform against eli all thing which i have
spoken concern hi house: when i begin i will also make an end

3:13 for i have told him that i will judg hi hous for ever for the
iniqu which he knoweth; becaus hi son made themselv vile and
he restrain them not

3:14 and therefor i have sworn unto the hous of eli that the
iniqu of eli hous shall not be purg with sacrific nor
offer for ever

3:15 and samuel lay until the morn and open the door of the
hous of the lord and samuel fear to shew eli the vision

3:16 then eli call samuel and said samuel my son and he
answer here am i

3:17 and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee?
i pray thee hide it not from me: god do so to thee and more also if
thou hide ani thing from me of all the thing that he said unto thee

3:18 and samuel told him everi whit and hid noth from him and he
said it is the lord: let him do what seemeth him good

3:19 and samuel grew and the lord wa with him and did let none of
hi word fall to the ground

3:20 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel wa
establish to be a prophet of the lord

3:21 and the lord appear again in shiloh: for the lord reveal
himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord

4:1 and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out
against the philistin to battl and pitch besid ebenezer: and
the philistin pitch in aphek

4:2 and the philistin put themselv in array against israel: and
when they join battl israel wa smitten befor the philistines:
and they slew of the armi in the field about four thousand men

4:3 and when the peopl were come into the camp the elder of israel
said wherefor hath the lord smitten us to day befor the
philistines? let us fetch the ark of the coven of the lord out of
shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of
the hand of our enemi

4:4 so the peopl sent to shiloh that they might bring from thenc
the ark of the coven of the lord of host which dwelleth between
the cherubims: and the two son of eli hophni and phineha were
there with the ark of the coven of god

4:5 and when the ark of the coven of the lord came into the camp
all israel shout with a great shout so that the earth rang again

4:6 and when the philistin heard the nois of the shout they said
what meaneth the nois of thi great shout in the camp of the hebrews?
and they understood that the ark of the lord wa come into the camp

4:7 and the philistin were afraid for they said god is come into
the camp and they said woe unto us! for there hath not been such a
thing heretofor

4:8 woe unto us! who shall deliv us out of the hand of these mighti
gods? these are the god that smote the egyptian with all the plagu
in the wilder

4:9 be strong and quit yourselv like men o ye philistin that ye
be not servant unto the hebrew as they have been to you: quit
yourselv like men and fight

4:10 and the philistin fought and israel wa smitten and they fled
everi man into hi tent: and there wa a veri great slaughter; for
there fell of israel thirti thousand footmen

4:11 and the ark of god wa taken; and the two son of eli hophni and
phineha were slain

4:12 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the armi and came to
shiloh the same day with hi cloth rent and with earth upon hi
head

4:13 and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the waysid
watching: for hi heart trembl for the ark of god and when the man
came into the citi and told it all the citi cri out

4:14 and when eli heard the nois of the cri he said what meaneth
the nois of thi tumult? and the man came in hastili and told eli

4:15 now eli wa nineti and eight year old; and hi eye were dim
that he could not see

4:16 and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the armi and
i fled to day out of the armi and he said what is there done my
son? 4:17 and the messeng answer and said israel is fled befor
the philistin and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
peopl and thi two son also hophni and phineha are dead and the
ark of god is taken

4:18 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and hi
neck brake and he died: for he wa an old man and heavi and he had
judg israel forti year

4:19 and hi daughter in law phineha wife wa with child near to
be delivered: and when she heard the tide that the ark of god wa
taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bow
herself and travailed; for her pain came upon her

4:20 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
unto her fear not; for thou hast born a son but she answer not
neither did she regard it

4:21 and she name the child ichabod say the glori is depart
from israel: becaus the ark of god wa taken and becaus of her
father in law and her husband

4:22 and she said the glori is depart from israel: for the ark of
god is taken

5:1 and the philistin took the ark of god and brought it from
ebenez unto ashdod

5:2 when the philistin took the ark of god they brought it into the
hous of dagon and set it by dagon

5:3 and when they of ashdod aros earli on the morrow behold dagon
wa fallen upon hi face to the earth befor the ark of the lord and
they took dagon and set him in hi place again

5:4 and when they aros earli on the morrow morn behold dagon wa
fallen upon hi face to the ground befor the ark of the lord; and the
head of dagon and both the palm of hi hand were cut off upon the
threshold; onli the stump of dagon wa left to him

5:5 therefor neither the priest of dagon nor ani that come into
dagon hous tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto thi
day

5:6 but the hand of the lord wa heavi upon them of ashdod and he
destroy them and smote them with emerod even ashdod and the
coast thereof

5:7 and when the men of ashdod saw that it wa so they said the ark
of the god of israel shall not abid with us: for hi hand is sore
upon us and upon dagon our god

5:8 they sent therefor and gather all the lord of the philistin
unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of
israel? and they answer let the ark of the god of israel be carri
about unto gath and they carri the ark of the god of israel about
thither

5:9 and it wa so that after they had carri it about the hand of
the lord wa against the citi with a veri great destruction: and he
smote the men of the citi both small and great and they had emerod
in their secret part

5:10 therefor they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass
as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronit cri out say
they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us
and our peopl

5:11 so they sent and gather togeth all the lord of the
philistin and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let
it go again to hi own place that it slay us not and our people: for
there wa a deadli destruct throughout all the city; the hand of
god wa veri heavi there

5:12 and the men that die not were smitten with the emerods: and the
cri of the citi went up to heaven

6:1 and the ark of the lord wa in the countri of the philistin
seven month

6:2 and the philistin call for the priest and the divin
say what shall we do to the ark of the lord? tell us wherewith we
shall send it to hi place

6:3 and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send
it not empty; but in ani wise return him a trespass offering: then ye
shall be heal and it shall be known to you whi hi hand is not
remov from you

6:4 then said they what shall be the trespass offer which we shall
return to him? they answer five golden emerod and five golden
mice accord to the number of the lord of the philistines: for one
plagu wa on you all and on your lord

6:5 wherefor ye shall make imag of your emerod and imag of your
mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glori unto the god of
israel: peradventur he will lighten hi hand from off you and from
off your god and from off your land

6:6 wherefor then do ye harden your heart as the egyptian and
pharaoh harden their hearts? when he had wrought wonder among
them did they not let the peopl go and they departed? 6:7 now
therefor make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there
hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their
calv home from them: 6:8 and take the ark of the lord and lay it
upon the cart; and put the jewel of gold which ye return him for a
trespass offer in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away
that it may go

6:9 and see if it goeth up by the way of hi own coast to
bethshemesh then he hath done us thi great evil: but if not then we
shall know that it is not hi hand that smote us: it wa a chanc that
happen to us

6:10 and the men did so; and took two milch kine and tie them to the
cart and shut up their calv at home: 6:11 and they laid the ark of
the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the
imag of their emerod

6:12 and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and
went along the highway low as they went and turn not asid to
the right hand or to the left; and the lord of the philistin went
after them unto the border of bethshemesh

6:13 and they of bethshemesh were reap their wheat harvest in the
valley: and they lift up their eye and saw the ark and rejoic
to see it

6:14 and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemit and
stood there where there wa a great stone: and they clave the wood of
the cart and offer the kine a burnt offer unto the lord

6:15 and the levit took down the ark of the lord and the coffer
that wa with it wherein the jewel of gold were and put them on the
great stone: and the men of bethshemesh offer burnt offer and
sacrif sacrific the same day unto the lord

6:16 and when the five lord of the philistin had seen it they
return to ekron the same day

6:17 and these are the golden emerod which the philistin return
for a trespass offer unto the lord; for ashdod one for gaza one
for askelon one for gath one for ekron one; 6:18 and the golden
mice accord to the number of all the citi of the philistin
belong to the five lord both of fenc citi and of countri
villag even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the
ark of the lord: which stone remaineth unto thi day in the field of
joshua the bethshemit

6:19 and he smote the men of bethshemesh becaus they had look into
the ark of the lord even he smote of the peopl fifti thousand and
threescor and ten men: and the peopl lament becaus the lord had
smitten mani of the peopl with a great slaughter

6:20 and the men of bethshemesh said who is abl to stand befor thi
holi lord god? and to whom shall he go up from us? 6:21 and they sent
messeng to the inhabit of kirjathjearim say the
philistin have brought again the ark of the lord; come ye down and
fetch it up to you

7:1 and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetch up the ark of the
lord and brought it into the hous of abinadab in the hill and
sanctifi eleazar hi son to keep the ark of the lord

7:2 and it came to pass while the ark abod in kirjathjearim that
the time wa long; for it wa twenti years: and all the hous of
israel lament after the lord

7:3 and samuel spake unto all the hous of israel say if ye do
return unto the lord with all your heart then put away the strang
god and ashtaroth from among you and prepar your heart unto the
lord and serv him only: and he will deliv you out of the hand of
the philistin

7:4 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and
serv the lord onli

7:5 and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for
you unto the lord

7:6 and they gather togeth to mizpeh and drew water and pour
it out befor the lord and fast on that day and said there we
have sin against the lord and samuel judg the children of israel
in mizpeh

7:7 and when the philistin heard that the children of israel were
gather togeth to mizpeh the lord of the philistin went up
against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were
afraid of the philistin

7:8 and the children of israel said to samuel ceas not to cri unto
the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the
philistin

7:9 and samuel took a suck lamb and offer it for a burnt
offer wholli unto the lord: and samuel cri unto the lord for
israel; and the lord heard him

7:10 and as samuel wa offer up the burnt offer the philistin
drew near to battl against israel: but the lord thunder with a
great thunder on that day upon the philistin and discomfit them;
and they were smitten befor israel

7:11 and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursu the
philistin and smote them until they came under bethcar

7:12 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and
call the name of it ebenez say hitherto hath the lord help
us

7:13 so the philistin were subdu and they came no more into the
coast of israel: and the hand of the lord wa against the philistin
all the day of samuel

7:14 and the citi which the philistin had taken from israel were
restor to israel from ekron even unto gath; and the coast thereof
did israel deliv out of the hand of the philistin and there wa
peac between israel and the amorit

7:15 and samuel judg israel all the day of hi life

7:16 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal
and mizpeh and judg israel in all those place

7:17 and hi return wa to ramah; for there wa hi house; and there
he judg israel; and there he built an altar unto the lord

8:1 and it came to pass when samuel wa old that he made hi son
judg over israel

8:2 now the name of hi firstborn wa joel; and the name of hi
second abiah: they were judg in beersheba

8:3 and hi son walk not in hi way but turn asid after lucr
and took bribe and pervert judgment

8:4 then all the elder of israel gather themselv togeth and
came to samuel unto ramah 8:5 and said unto him behold thou art
old and thi son walk not in thi ways: now make us a king to judg us
like all the nation

8:6 but the thing displeas samuel when they said give us a king to
judg us and samuel pray unto the lord

8:7 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voic of the
peopl in all that they say unto thee: for they have not reject
thee but they have reject me that i should not reign over them

8:8 accord to all the work which they have done sinc the day that
i brought them up out of egypt even unto thi day wherewith they have
forsaken me and serv other god so do they also unto thee

8:9 now therefor hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
solemnli unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall
reign over them

8:10 and samuel told all the word of the lord unto the peopl that
ask of him a king

8:11 and he said thi will be the manner of the king that shall reign
over you: he will take your son and appoint them for himself for
hi chariot and to be hi horsemen; and some shall run befor hi
chariot

8:12 and he will appoint him captain over thousand and captain
over fifties; and will set them to ear hi ground and to reap hi
harvest and to make hi instrument of war and instrument of hi
chariot

8:13 and he will take your daughter to be confectionari and to be
cook and to be baker

8:14 and he will take your field and your vineyard and your
oliveyard even the best of them and give them to hi servant

8:15 and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyard
and give to hi offic and to hi servant

8:16 and he will take your menserv and your maidserv and
your goodliest young men and your ass and put them to hi work

8:17 he will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be hi
servant

8:18 and ye shall cri out in that day becaus of your king which ye
shall have chosen you; and the lord will not hear you in that day

8:19 nevertheless the peopl refus to obey the voic of samuel; and
they said nay; but we will have a king over us; 8:20 that we also may
be like all the nations; and that our king may judg us and go out
befor us and fight our battl

8:21 and samuel heard all the word of the peopl and he rehears
them in the ear of the lord

8:22 and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voic and make
them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye everi man
unto hi citi

9:1 now there wa a man of benjamin whose name wa kish the son of
abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a
benjamit a mighti man of power

9:2 and he had a son whose name wa saul a choic young man and a
goodly: and there wa not among the children of israel a goodlier
person than he: from hi shoulder and upward he wa higher than ani
of the peopl

9:3 and the ass of kish saul father were lost and kish said to
saul hi son take now one of the servant with thee and aris go
seek the ass

9:4 and he pass through mount ephraim and pass through the land
of shalisha but they found them not: then they pass through the
land of shalim and there they were not: and he pass through the
land of the benjamit but they found them not

9:5 and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to hi
servant that wa with him come and let us return; lest my father
leav care for the ass and take thought for us

9:6 and he said unto him behold now there is in thi citi a man of
god and he is an honour man; all that he saith cometh sure to
pass: now let us go thither; peradventur he can shew us our way that
we should go

9:7 then said saul to hi servant but behold if we go what shall
we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessel and there is
not a present to bring to the man of god: what have we? 9:8 and the
servant answer saul again and said behold i have here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will i give to the man of god
to tell us our way

9:9 (beforetim in israel when a man went to enquir of god thu he
spake come and let us go to the seer: for he that is now call a
prophet wa beforetim call a seer) 9:10 then said saul to hi
servant well said; come let us go so they went unto the citi where
the man of god wa

9:11 and as they went up the hill to the citi they found young
maiden go out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here?
9:12 and they answer them and said he is; behold he is befor
you: make hast now for he came to day to the city; for there is a
sacrific of the peopl to day in the high place: 9:13 as soon as ye
be come into the citi ye shall straightway find him befor he go up
to the high place to eat: for the peopl will not eat until he come
becaus he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterward they eat that be
bidden now therefor get you up; for about thi time ye shall find
him

9:14 and they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
citi behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high
place

9:15 now the lord had told samuel in hi ear a day befor saul came
say 9:16 to morrow about thi time i will send thee a man out of
the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my
peopl israel that he may save my peopl out of the hand of the
philistines: for i have look upon my peopl becaus their cri is
come unto me

9:17 and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man
whom i spake to thee of! thi same shall reign over my peopl

9:18 then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i
pray thee where the seer hous is

9:19 and samuel answer saul and said i am the seer: go up befor
me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow
i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart

9:20 and as for thine ass that were lost three day ago set not thi
mind on them; for they are found and on whom is all the desir of
israel? is it not on thee and on all thi father house? 9:21 and
saul answer and said am not i a benjamit of the smallest of the
tribe of israel? and my famili the least of all the famili of the
tribe of benjamin? wherefor then speakest thou so to me? 9:22 and
samuel took saul and hi servant and brought them into the parlour
and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden
which were about thirti person

9:23 and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave
thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee

9:24 and the cook took up the shoulder and that which wa upon it
and set it befor saul and samuel said behold that which is left!
set it befor thee and eat: for unto thi time hath it been kept for
thee sinc i said i have invit the peopl so saul did eat with
samuel that day

9:25 and when they were come down from the high place into the citi
samuel commun with saul upon the top of the hous

9:26 and they aros early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
day that samuel call saul to the top of the hous say up that
i may send thee away and saul aros and they went out both of them
he and samuel abroad

9:27 and as they were go down to the end of the citi samuel said
to saul bid the servant pass on befor us (and he pass on) but
stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god

10:1 then samuel took a vial of oil and pour it upon hi head and
kiss him and said is it not becaus the lord hath anoint thee to
be captain over hi inheritance? 10:2 when thou art depart from me
to day then thou shalt find two men by rachel sepulchr in the
border of benjamin at zelzah; and they will say unto thee the ass
which thou wentest to seek are found: and lo thi father hath left
the care of the ass and sorroweth for you say what shall i do
for my son? 10:3 then shalt thou go on forward from thenc and thou
shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men
go up to god to bethel one carri three kid and anoth
carri three loav of bread and anoth carri a bottl of wine:
10:4 and they will salut thee and give thee two loav of bread;
which thou shalt receiv of their hand

10:5 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the
garrison of the philistines: and it shall come to pass when thou art
come thither to the citi that thou shalt meet a compani of prophet
come down from the high place with a psalteri and a tabret and a
pipe and a harp befor them; and they shall prophesy: 10:6 and the
spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesi with
them and shalt be turn into anoth man

10:7 and let it be when these sign are come unto thee that thou do
as occas serv thee; for god is with thee

10:8 and thou shalt go down befor me to gilgal; and behold i will
come down unto thee to offer burnt offer and to sacrific
sacrific of peac offerings: seven day shalt thou tarri till i
come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do

10:9 and it wa so that when he had turn hi back to go from
samuel god gave him anoth heart: and all those sign came to pass
that day

10:10 and when they came thither to the hill behold a compani of
prophet met him; and the spirit of god came upon him and he
prophesi among them

10:11 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetim saw that
behold he prophesi among the prophet then the peopl said one to
anoth what is thi that is come unto the son of kish? is saul also
among the prophets? 10:12 and one of the same place answer and
said but who is their father? therefor it becam a proverb is saul
also among the prophets? 10:13 and when he had made an end of
prophesi he came to the high place

10:14 and saul uncl said unto him and to hi servant whither went
ye? and he said to seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no
where we came to samuel

10:15 and saul uncl said tell me i pray thee what samuel said
unto you

10:16 and saul said unto hi uncl he told us plainli that the ass
were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he
told him not

10:17 and samuel call the peopl togeth unto the lord to mizpeh;
10:18 and said unto the children of israel thu saith the lord god of
israel i brought up israel out of egypt and deliv you out of the
hand of the egyptian and out of the hand of all kingdom and of
them that oppress you: 10:19 and ye have thi day reject your god
who himself save you out of all your advers and your
tribulations; and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us
now therefor present yourselv befor the lord by your tribe and
by your thousand

10:20 and when samuel had caus all the tribe of israel to come
near the tribe of benjamin wa taken

10:21 when he had caus the tribe of benjamin to come near by their
famili the famili of matri wa taken and saul the son of kish wa
taken: and when they sought him he could not be found

10:22 therefor they enquir of the lord further if the man should
yet come thither and the lord answer behold he hath hid himself
among the stuff

10:23 and they ran and fetch him thence: and when he stood among the
peopl he wa higher than ani of the peopl from hi shoulder and
upward

10:24 and samuel said to all the peopl see ye him whom the lord hath
chosen that there is none like him among all the people? and all the
peopl shout and said god save the king

10:25 then samuel told the peopl the manner of the kingdom and wrote
it in a book and laid it up befor the lord and samuel sent all the
peopl away everi man to hi hous

10:26 and saul also went home to gibeah; and there went with him a
band of men whose heart god had touch

10:27 but the children of belial said how shall thi man save us? and
they despis him and brought no present but he held hi peac

11:1 then nahash the ammonit came up and encamp against
jabeshgilead: and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a
coven with us and we will serv thee

11:2 and nahash the ammonit answer them on thi condit will i
make a coven with you that i may thrust out all your right eye
and lay it for a reproach upon all israel

11:3 and the elder of jabesh said unto him give us seven day
respit that we may send messeng unto all the coast of israel:
and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee

11:4 then came the messeng to gibeah of saul and told the tide
in the ear of the people: and all the peopl lift up their voic
and wept

11:5 and behold saul came after the herd out of the field; and saul
said what aileth the peopl that they weep? and they told him the
tide of the men of jabesh

11:6 and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tide
and hi anger wa kindl greatli

11:7 and he took a yoke of oxen and hew them in piec and sent
them throughout all the coast of israel by the hand of messeng
say whosoev cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so
shall it be done unto hi oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the
peopl and they came out with one consent

11:8 and when he number them in bezek the children of israel were
three hundr thousand and the men of judah thirti thousand

11:9 and they said unto the messeng that came thu shall ye say
unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot
ye shall have help and the messeng came and shew it to the men
of jabesh; and they were glad

11:10 therefor the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out
unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you

11:11 and it wa so on the morrow that saul put the peopl in three
companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morn
watch and slew the ammonit until the heat of the day: and it came
to pass that they which remain were scatter so that two of them
were not left togeth

11:12 and the peopl said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul
reign over us? bring the men that we may put them to death

11:13 and saul said there shall not a man be put to death thi day:
for to day the lord hath wrought salvat in israel

11:14 then said samuel to the peopl come and let us go to gilgal
and renew the kingdom there

11:15 and all the peopl went to gilgal; and there they made saul king
befor the lord in gilgal; and there they sacrif sacrific of
peac offer befor the lord; and there saul and all the men of
israel rejoic greatli

12:1 and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearken unto
your voic in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you

12:2 and now behold the king walketh befor you: and i am old and
grayheaded; and behold my son are with you: and i have walk
befor you from my childhood unto thi day

12:3 behold here i am: wit against me befor the lord and befor
hi anointed: whose ox have i taken? or whose ass have i taken? or
whom have i defrauded? whom have i oppressed? or of whose hand have i
receiv ani bribe to blind mine eye therewith? and i will restor it
you

12:4 and they said thou hast not defraud us nor oppress us
neither hast thou taken ought of ani man hand

12:5 and he said unto them the lord is wit against you and hi
anoint is wit thi day that ye have not found ought in my hand
and they answer he is wit

12:6 and samuel said unto the peopl it is the lord that advanc
mose and aaron and that brought your father up out of the land of
egypt

12:7 now therefor stand still that i may reason with you befor the
lord of all the righteou act of the lord which he did to you and to
your father

12:8 when jacob wa come into egypt and your father cri unto the
lord then the lord sent mose and aaron which brought forth your
father out of egypt and made them dwell in thi place

12:9 and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the
hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the
philistin and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought
against them

12:10 and they cri unto the lord and said we have sin becaus
we have forsaken the lord and have serv baalim and ashtaroth: but
now deliv us out of the hand of our enemi and we will serv thee

12:11 and the lord sent jerubba and bedan and jephthah and
samuel and deliv you out of the hand of your enemi on everi
side and ye dwell safe

12:12 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon
came against you ye said unto me nay; but a king shall reign over
us: when the lord your god wa your king

12:13 now therefor behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye
have desired! and behold the lord hath set a king over you

12:14 if ye will fear the lord and serv him and obey hi voic and
not rebel against the command of the lord then shall both ye and
also the king that reigneth over you continu follow the lord your
god: 12:15 but if ye will not obey the voic of the lord but rebel
against the command of the lord then shall the hand of the lord
be against you as it wa against your father

12:16 now therefor stand and see thi great thing which the lord
will do befor your eye

12:17 is it not wheat harvest to day? i will call unto the lord and
he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceiv and see that your
wicked is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in
ask you a king

12:18 so samuel call unto the lord; and the lord sent thunder and
rain that day: and all the peopl greatli fear the lord and samuel

12:19 and all the peopl said unto samuel pray for thi servant unto
the lord thi god that we die not: for we have ad unto all our sin
thi evil to ask us a king

12:20 and samuel said unto the peopl fear not: ye have done all thi
wickedness: yet turn not asid from follow the lord but serv the
lord with all your heart; 12:21 and turn ye not aside: for then should
ye go after vain thing which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are
vain

12:22 for the lord will not forsak hi peopl for hi great name
sake: becaus it hath pleas the lord to make you hi peopl

12:23 moreov as for me god forbid that i should sin against the
lord in ceas to pray for you: but i will teach you the good and the
right way: 12:24 onli fear the lord and serv him in truth with all
your heart: for consid how great thing he hath done for you

12:25 but if ye shall still do wickedli ye shall be consum both ye
and your king

13:1 saul reign one year; and when he had reign two year over
israel 13:2 saul chose him three thousand men of israel; whereof two
thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a
thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin: and the rest of the
peopl he sent everi man to hi tent

13:3 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistin that wa in
geba and the philistin heard of it and saul blew the trumpet
throughout all the land say let the hebrew hear

13:4 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the
philistin and that israel also wa had in abomin with the
philistin and the peopl were call togeth after saul to gilgal

13:5 and the philistin gather themselv togeth to fight with
israel thirti thousand chariot and six thousand horsemen and
peopl as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they
came up and pitch in michmash eastward from bethaven

13:6 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait (for the
peopl were distressed) then the peopl did hide themselv in cave
and in thicket and in rock and in high place and in pit

13:7 and some of the hebrew went over jordan to the land of gad and
gilead as for saul he wa yet in gilgal and all the peopl follow
him trembl

13:8 and he tarri seven day accord to the set time that samuel
had appointed: but samuel came not to gilgal; and the peopl were
scatter from him

13:9 and saul said bring hither a burnt offer to me and peac
offer and he offer the burnt offer

13:10 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of
offer the burnt offer behold samuel came; and saul went out to
meet him that he might salut him

13:11 and samuel said what hast thou done? and saul said becaus i
saw that the peopl were scatter from me and that thou camest not
within the day appoint and that the philistin gather
themselv togeth at michmash; 13:12 therefor said i the
philistin will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made
supplic unto the lord: i forc myself therefor and offer a
burnt offer

13:13 and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
kept the command of the lord thi god which he command thee: for
now would the lord have establish thi kingdom upon israel for ever

13:14 but now thi kingdom shall not continue: the lord hath sought him
a man after hi own heart and the lord hath command him to be
captain over hi peopl becaus thou hast not kept that which the
lord command thee

13:15 and samuel aros and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of
benjamin and saul number the peopl that were present with him
about six hundr men

13:16 and saul and jonathan hi son and the peopl that were present
with them abod in gibeah of benjamin: but the philistin encamp
in michmash

13:17 and the spoiler came out of the camp of the philistin in
three companies: one compani turn unto the way that leadeth to
ophrah unto the land of shual: 13:18 and anoth compani turn the
way to bethhoron: and anoth compani turn to the way of the border
that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilder

13:19 now there wa no smith found throughout all the land of israel:
for the philistin said lest the hebrew make them sword or spears:
13:20 but all the israelit went down to the philistin to sharpen
everi man hi share and hi coulter and hi axe and hi mattock

13:21 yet they had a file for the mattock and for the coulter and
for the fork and for the axe and to sharpen the goad

13:22 so it came to pass in the day of battl that there wa neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of ani of the peopl that were with
saul and jonathan: but with saul and with jonathan hi son wa there
found

13:23 and the garrison of the philistin went out to the passag of
michmash

14:1 now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul
said unto the young man that bare hi armour come and let us go over
to the philistin garrison that is on the other side but he told
not hi father

14:2 and saul tarri in the uttermost part of gibeah under a
pomegran tree which is in migron: and the peopl that were with him
were about six hundr men; 14:3 and ahiah the son of ahitub
ichabod brother the son of phineha the son of eli the lord
priest in shiloh wear an ephod and the peopl knew not that
jonathan wa gone

14:4 and between the passag by which jonathan sought to go over
unto the philistin garrison there wa a sharp rock on the one
side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one wa
bozez and the name of the other seneh

14:5 the forefront of the one wa situat northward over against
michmash and the other southward over against gibeah

14:6 and jonathan said to the young man that bare hi armour come
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be
that the lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the lord
to save by mani or by few

14:7 and hi armourbear said unto him do all that is in thine
heart: turn thee; behold i am with thee accord to thi heart

14:8 then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and
we will discov ourselv unto them

14:9 if they say thu unto us tarri until we come to you; then we
will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them

14:10 but if they say thu come up unto us; then we will go up: for
the lord hath deliv them into our hand: and thi shall be a sign
unto us

14:11 and both of them discov themselv unto the garrison of the
philistines: and the philistin said behold the hebrew come forth
out of the hole where they had hid themselv

14:12 and the men of the garrison answer jonathan and hi
armourbear and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing
and jonathan said unto hi armourbear come up after me: for the
lord hath deliv them into the hand of israel

14:13 and jonathan climb up upon hi hand and upon hi feet and
hi armourbear after him: and they fell befor jonathan; and hi
armourbear slew after him

14:14 and that first slaughter which jonathan and hi armourbear
made wa about twenti men within as it were an half acr of land
which a yoke of oxen might plow

14:15 and there wa trembl in the host in the field and among all
the people: the garrison and the spoiler they also trembl and
the earth quaked: so it wa a veri great trembl

14:16 and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked; and
behold the multitud melt away and they went on beat down one
anoth

14:17 then said saul unto the peopl that were with him number now
and see who is gone from us and when they had number behold
jonathan and hi armourbear were not there

14:18 and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the
ark of god wa at that time with the children of israel

14:19 and it came to pass while saul talk unto the priest that the
nois that wa in the host of the philistin went on and increased:
and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand

14:20 and saul and all the peopl that were with him assembl
themselv and they came to the battle: and behold everi man
sword wa against hi fellow and there wa a veri great discomfitur

14:21 moreov the hebrew that were with the philistin befor that
time which went up with them into the camp from the countri round
about even they also turn to be with the israelit that were with
saul and jonathan

14:22 likewis all the men of israel which had hid themselv in mount
ephraim when they heard that the philistin fled even they also
follow hard after them in the battl

14:23 so the lord save israel that day: and the battl pass over
unto bethaven

14:24 and the men of israel were distress that day: for saul had
adjur the peopl say curs be the man that eateth ani food
until even that i may be aveng on mine enemi so none of the
peopl tast ani food

14:25 and all they of the land came to a wood; and there wa honey
upon the ground

14:26 and when the peopl were come into the wood behold the honey
dropped; but no man put hi hand to hi mouth: for the peopl fear
the oath

14:27 but jonathan heard not when hi father charg the peopl with
the oath: wherefor he put forth the end of the rod that wa in hi
hand and dip it in an honeycomb and put hi hand to hi mouth;
and hi eye were enlighten

14:28 then answer one of the peopl and said thi father straitli
charg the peopl with an oath say curs be the man that eateth
ani food thi day and the peopl were faint

14:29 then said jonathan my father hath troubl the land: see i
pray you how mine eye have been enlighten becaus i tast a
littl of thi honey

14:30 how much more if hapli the peopl had eaten freeli to day of
the spoil of their enemi which they found? for had there not been
now a much greater slaughter among the philistines? 14:31 and they
smote the philistin that day from michmash to aijalon: and the
peopl were veri faint

14:32 and the peopl flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen
and calv and slew them on the ground: and the peopl did eat them
with the blood

14:33 then they told saul say behold the peopl sin against the
lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have
transgressed: roll a great stone unto me thi day

14:34 and saul said dispers yourselv among the peopl and say
unto them bring me hither everi man hi ox and everi man hi sheep
and slay them here and eat; and sin not against the lord in eat
with the blood

and all the peopl brought everi man hi ox with him that night and
slew them there

14:35 and saul built an altar unto the lord: the same wa the first
altar that he built unto the lord

14:36 and saul said let us go down after the philistin by night
and spoil them until the morn light and let us not leav a man of
them and they said do whatsoev seemeth good unto thee then said
the priest let us draw near hither unto god

14:37 and saul ask counsel of god shall i go down after the
philistines? wilt thou deliv them into the hand of israel? but he
answer him not that day

14:38 and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people:
and know and see wherein thi sin hath been thi day

14:39 for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in
jonathan my son he shall sure die but there wa not a man among
all the peopl that answer him

14:40 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and
jonathan my son will be on the other side and the peopl said unto
saul do what seemeth good unto thee

14:41 therefor saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect
lot

and saul and jonathan were taken: but the peopl escap

14:42 and saul said cast lot between me and jonathan my son and
jonathan wa taken

14:43 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and
jonathan told him and said i did but tast a littl honey with the
end of the rod that wa in mine hand and lo i must die

14:44 and saul answer god do so and more also: for thou shalt
sure die jonathan

14:45 and the peopl said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath
wrought thi great salvat in israel? god forbid: as the lord
liveth there shall not one hair of hi head fall to the ground; for
he hath wrought with god thi day so the peopl rescu jonathan
that he die not

14:46 then saul went up from follow the philistines: and the
philistin went to their own place

14:47 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all hi
enemi on everi side against moab and against the children of
ammon and against edom and against the king of zobah and against
the philistines: and whithersoev he turn himself he vex them

14:48 and he gather an host and smote the amalekit and deliv
israel out of the hand of them that spoil them

14:49 now the son of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua:
and the name of hi two daughter were these; the name of the
firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal: 14:50 and the
name of saul wife wa ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz: and the name
of the captain of hi host wa abner the son of ner saul uncl

14:51 and kish wa the father of saul; and ner the father of abner wa
the son of abiel

14:52 and there wa sore war against the philistin all the day of
saul: and when saul saw ani strong man or ani valiant man he took
him unto him

15:1 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be
king over hi peopl over israel: now therefor hearken thou unto the
voic of the word of the lord

15:2 thu saith the lord of host i rememb that which amalek did to
israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from
egypt

15:3 now go and smite amalek and utterli destroy all that they have
and spare them not; but slay both man and woman infant and suckl
ox and sheep camel and ass

15:4 and saul gather the peopl togeth and number them in
telaim two hundr thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah

15:5 and saul came to a citi of amalek and laid wait in the valley

15:6 and saul said unto the kenit go depart get you down from
among the amalekit lest i destroy you with them: for ye shew
kind to all the children of israel when they came up out of
egypt so the kenit depart from among the amalekit

15:7 and saul smote the amalekit from havilah until thou comest to
shur that is over against egypt

15:8 and he took agag the king of the amalekit aliv and utterli
destroy all the peopl with the edg of the sword

15:9 but saul and the peopl spare agag and the best of the sheep
and of the oxen and of the fatl and the lamb and all that wa
good and would not utterli destroy them: but everi thing that wa
vile and refus that they destroy utterli

15:10 then came the word of the lord unto samuel say 15:11 it
repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king: for he is turn back
from follow me and hath not perform my command and it
griev samuel; and he cri unto the lord all night

15:12 and when samuel rose earli to meet saul in the morn it wa
told samuel say saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a
place and is gone about and pass on and gone down to gilgal

15:13 and samuel came to saul: and saul said unto him bless be thou
of the lord: i have perform the command of the lord

15:14 and samuel said what meaneth then thi bleat of the sheep in
mine ear and the low of the oxen which i hear? 15:15 and saul
said they have brought them from the amalekites: for the peopl
spare the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrific unto the
lord thi god; and the rest we have utterli destroy

15:16 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the
lord hath said to me thi night and he said unto him say on

15:17 and samuel said when thou wast littl in thine own sight wast
thou not made the head of the tribe of israel and the lord anoint
thee king over israel? 15:18 and the lord sent thee on a journey and
said go and utterli destroy the sinner the amalekit and fight
against them until they be consum

15:19 wherefor then didst thou not obey the voic of the lord but
didst fli upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord?
15:20 and saul said unto samuel yea i have obey the voic of the
lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought
agag the king of amalek and have utterli destroy the amalekit

15:21 but the peopl took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of
the thing which should have been utterli destroy to sacrific unto
the lord thi god in gilgal

15:22 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt
offer and sacrific as in obey the voic of the lord? behold
to obey is better than sacrific and to hearken than the fat of ram

15:23 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubborn is
as iniqu and idolatri becaus thou hast reject the word of the
lord he hath also reject thee from be king

15:24 and saul said unto samuel i have sinned: for i have
transgress the command of the lord and thi words: becaus i
fear the peopl and obey their voic

15:25 now therefor i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with
me that i may worship the lord

15:26 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee: for thou
hast reject the word of the lord and the lord hath reject thee
from be king over israel

15:27 and as samuel turn about to go away he laid hold upon the
skirt of hi mantl and it rent

15:28 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of
israel from thee thi day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine
that is better than thou

15:29 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent: for he
is not a man that he should repent

15:30 then he said i have sinned: yet honour me now i pray thee
befor the elder of my peopl and befor israel and turn again with
me that i may worship the lord thi god

15:31 so samuel turn again after saul; and saul worship the lord

15:32 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the
amalekit and agag came unto him delic and agag said sure
the bitter of death is past

15:33 and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so
shall thi mother be childless among women and samuel hew agag in
piec befor the lord in gilgal

15:34 then samuel went to ramah; and saul went up to hi hous to
gibeah of saul

15:35 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of hi death:
nevertheless samuel mourn for saul: and the lord repent that he
had made saul king over israel

16:1 and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul
see i have reject him from reign over israel? fill thine horn
with oil and go i will send thee to jess the bethlehemite: for i
have provid me a king among hi son

16:2 and samuel said how can i go? if saul hear it he will kill me
and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to
sacrific to the lord

16:3 and call jess to the sacrific and i will shew thee what thou
shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee

16:4 and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem
and the elder of the town trembl at hi come and said comest
thou peaceably? 16:5 and he said peaceably: i am come to sacrific
unto the lord: sanctifi yourselv and come with me to the sacrific
and he sanctifi jess and hi son and call them to the
sacrific

16:6 and it came to pass when they were come that he look on
eliab and said sure the lord anoint is befor him

16:7 but the lord said unto samuel look not on hi counten or on
the height of hi stature; becaus i have refus him: for the lord
seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appear but
the lord looketh on the heart

16:8 then jess call abinadab and made him pass befor samuel and
he said neither hath the lord chosen thi

16:9 then jess made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the
lord chosen thi

16:10 again jess made seven of hi son to pass befor samuel and
samuel said unto jess the lord hath not chosen these

16:11 and samuel said unto jess are here all thi children? and he
said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the
sheep and samuel said unto jess send and fetch him: for we will not
sit down till he come hither

16:12 and he sent and brought him in now he wa ruddi and withal of
a beauti counten and goodli to look to and the lord said
aris anoint him: for thi is he

16:13 then samuel took the horn of oil and anoint him in the midst
of hi brethren: and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that
day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah

16:14 but the spirit of the lord depart from saul and an evil
spirit from the lord troubl him

16:15 and saul servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit
from god troubleth thee

16:16 let our lord now command thi servant which are befor thee to
seek out a man who is a cun player on an harp: and it shall come
to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall
play with hi hand and thou shalt be well

16:17 and saul said unto hi servant provid me now a man that can

greatly; and he becam hi armourbear

16:22 and saul sent to jess say let david i pray thee stand

17:1 now the philistin gather togeth their armi to battl and

17:2 and saul and the men of israel were gather togeth and

philistin

17:3 and the philistin stood on a mountain on the one side and
israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there wa a valley

17:10 and the philistin said i defi the armi of israel thi day;
give me a man that we may fight togeth

17:11 when saul and all israel heard those word of the philistin
they were dismay and greatli afraid

17:12 now david wa the son of that ephrathit of bethlehemjudah
whose name wa jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among
men for an old man in the day of saul

17:13 and the three eldest son of jess went and follow saul to the

eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third
shammah

17:14 and david wa the youngest: and the three eldest follow saul

17:15 but david went and return from saul to feed hi father sheep

17:16 and the philistin drew near morn and even and present

17:17 and jess said unto david hi son take now for thi brethren an
ephah of thi parch corn and these ten loav and run to the camp
of thi brethren; 17:18 and carri these ten chees unto the captain of
their thousand and look how thi brethren fare and take their pledg

17:19 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the

17:20 and david rose up earli in the morn and left the sheep with
a keeper and took and went as jess had command him; and he came
to the trench as the host wa go forth to the fight and shout
for the battl

17:21 for israel and the philistin had put the battl in array armi
against armi

17:22 and david left hi carriag in the hand of the keeper of the
carriag and ran into the armi and came and salut hi brethren

17:23 and as he talk with them behold there came up the champion
the philistin of gath goliath by name out of the armi of the
philistin and spake accord to the same words: and david heard
them

17:24 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him
and were sore afraid

17:25 and the men of israel said have ye seen thi man that is come
up? sure to defi israel is he come up: and it shall be that the
man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great rich and
will give him hi daughter and make hi father hous free in
israel

17:26 and david spake to the men that stood by him say what shall
be done to the man that killeth thi philistin and taketh away the
reproach from israel? for who is thi uncircumcis philistin that
he should defi the armi of the live god? 17:27 and the peopl
answer him after thi manner say so shall it be done to the man
that killeth him

17:28 and eliab hi eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
and eliab anger wa kindl against david and he said whi camest
thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness? i know thi pride and the naughti of thine heart; for
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battl

17:29 and david said what have i now done? is there not a cause?
17:30 and he turn from him toward anoth and spake after the same
manner: and the peopl answer him again after the former manner

17:31 and when the word were heard which david spake they rehears
them befor saul: and he sent for him

17:32 and david said to saul let no man heart fail becaus of him;
thi servant will go and fight with thi philistin

17:33 and saul said to david thou art not abl to go against thi
philistin to fight with him: for thou art but a youth and he a man
of war from hi youth

17:34 and david said unto saul thi servant kept hi father sheep
and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock:
17:35 and i went out after him and smote him and deliv it out of
hi mouth: and when he aros against me i caught him by hi beard
and smote him and slew him

17:36 thi servant slew both the lion and the bear: and thi
uncircumcis philistin shall be as one of them see he hath
defi the armi of the live god

17:37 david said moreov the lord that deliv me out of the paw
of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliv me out of
the hand of thi philistin and saul said unto david go and the
lord be with thee

17:38 and saul arm david with hi armour and he put an helmet of
brass upon hi head; also he arm him with a coat of mail

17:39 and david gird hi sword upon hi armour and he assay to
go; for he had not prove it and david said unto saul i cannot go
with these; for i have not prove them and david put them off him

17:40 and he took hi staff in hi hand and chose him five smooth
stone out of the brook and put them in a shepherd bag which he
had even in a scrip; and hi sling wa in hi hand: and he drew near
to the philistin

17:41 and the philistin came on and drew near unto david; and the man
that bare the shield went befor him

17:42 and when the philistin look about and saw david he
disdain him: for he wa but a youth and ruddi and of a fair
counten

17:43 and the philistin said unto david am i a dog that thou comest
to me with staves? and the philistin curs david by hi god

17:44 and the philistin said to david come to me and i will give
thi flesh unto the fowl of the air and to the beast of the field

17:45 then said david to the philistin thou comest to me with a
sword and with a spear and with a shield: but i come to thee in the
name of the lord of host the god of the armi of israel whom thou
hast defi

17:46 thi day will the lord deliv thee into mine hand; and i will
smite thee and take thine head from thee; and i will give the
carcas of the host of the philistin thi day unto the fowl of the
air and to the wild beast of the earth; that all the earth may know
that there is a god in israel

17:47 and all thi assembl shall know that the lord saveth not with
sword and spear: for the battl is the lord and he will give you
into our hand

17:48 and it came to pass when the philistin aros and came and
drew nigh to meet david that david hasten and ran toward the armi
to meet the philistin

17:49 and david put hi hand in hi bag and took thenc a stone and
slang it and smote the philistin in hi forehead that the stone
sunk into hi forehead; and he fell upon hi face to the earth

17:50 so david prevail over the philistin with a sling and with a
stone and smote the philistin and slew him; but there wa no sword
in the hand of david

17:51 therefor david ran and stood upon the philistin and took hi
sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut
off hi head therewith and when the philistin saw their champion
wa dead they fled

17:52 and the men of israel and of judah aros and shout and
pursu the philistin until thou come to the valley and to the
gate of ekron

and the wound of the philistin fell down by the way to shaaraim
even unto gath and unto ekron

17:53 and the children of israel return from chase after the
philistin and they spoil their tent

17:54 and david took the head of the philistin and brought it to
jerusalem; but he put hi armour in hi tent

17:55 and when saul saw david go forth against the philistin he said
unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is thi youth?
and abner said as thi soul liveth o king i cannot tell

17:56 and the king said enquir thou whose son the stripl is

17:57 and as david return from the slaughter of the philistin
abner took him and brought him befor saul with the head of the
philistin in hi hand

17:58 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man? and
david answer i am the son of thi servant jess the bethlehemit

18:1 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speak unto
saul that the soul of jonathan wa knit with the soul of david and
jonathan love him as hi own soul

18:2 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to
hi father hous

18:3 then jonathan and david made a coven becaus he love him as
hi own soul

18:4 and jonathan strip himself of the robe that wa upon him and
gave it to david and hi garment even to hi sword and to hi bow
and to hi girdl

18:5 and david went out whithersoev saul sent him and behav
himself wisely: and saul set him over the men of war and he wa
accept in the sight of all the peopl and also in the sight of
saul servant

18:6 and it came to pass as they came when david wa return from
the slaughter of the philistin that the women came out of all citi
of israel sing and danc to meet king saul with tabret with
joy and with instrument of musick

18:7 and the women answer one anoth as they play and said saul
hath slain hi thousand and david hi ten thousand

18:8 and saul wa veri wroth and the say displeas him; and he
said they have ascrib unto david ten thousand and to me they have
ascrib but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
18:9 and saul eye david from that day and forward

18:10 and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god
came upon saul and he prophesi in the midst of the house: and david
play with hi hand as at other times: and there wa a javelin in
saul hand

18:11 and saul cast the javelin; for he said i will smite david even
to the wall with it and david avoid out of hi presenc twice

18:12 and saul wa afraid of david becaus the lord wa with him and
wa depart from saul

18:13 therefor saul remov him from him and made him hi captain
over a thousand; and he went out and came in befor the peopl

18:14 and david behav himself wise in all hi ways; and the lord
wa with him

18:15 wherefor when saul saw that he behav himself veri wise he
wa afraid of him

18:16 but all israel and judah love david becaus he went out and
came in befor them

18:17 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will
i give thee to wife: onli be thou valiant for me and fight the lord
battl

for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the
philistin be upon him

18:18 and david said unto saul who am i? and what is my life or my
father famili in israel that i should be son in law to the king?
18:19 but it came to pass at the time when merab saul daughter
should have been given to david that she wa given unto adriel the
meholathit to wife

18:20 and michal saul daughter love david: and they told saul and
the thing pleas him

18:21 and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to
him and that the hand of the philistin may be against him
wherefor saul said to david thou shalt thi day be my son in law in
the one of the twain

18:22 and saul command hi servant say commun with david
secretli and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all hi
servant love thee: now therefor be the king son in law

18:23 and saul servant spake those word in the ear of david and
david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king son in law
see that i am a poor man and lightli esteemed? 18:24 and the
servant of saul told him say on thi manner spake david

18:25 and saul said thu shall ye say to david the king desireth not
ani dowri but an hundr foreskin of the philistin to be aveng
of the king enemi but saul thought to make david fall by the hand
of the philistin

18:26 and when hi servant told david these word it pleas david
well to be the king son in law: and the day were not expir

18:27 wherefor david aros and went he and hi men and slew of the
philistin two hundr men; and david brought their foreskin and
they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the king
son in law and saul gave him michal hi daughter to wife

18:28 and saul saw and knew that the lord wa with david and that
michal saul daughter love him

18:29 and saul wa yet the more afraid of david; and saul becam
david enemi continu

18:30 then the princ of the philistin went forth: and it came to
pass after they went forth that david behav himself more wise
than all the servant of saul; so that hi name wa much set by

19:1 and saul spake to jonathan hi son and to all hi servant that
they should kill david

19:2 but jonathan saul son delight much in david: and jonathan
told david say saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
therefor i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morn and
abid in a secret place and hide thyself: 19:3 and i will go out and
stand besid my father in the field where thou art and i will commun
with my father of thee; and what i see that i will tell thee

19:4 and jonathan spake good of david unto saul hi father and said
unto him let not the king sin against hi servant against david;
becaus he hath not sin against thee and becaus hi work have
been to thee-ward veri good: 19:5 for he did put hi life in hi hand
and slew the philistin and the lord wrought a great salvat for
all israel: thou sawest it and didst rejoice: wherefor then wilt
thou sin against innoc blood to slay david without a cause? 19:6
and saul hearken unto the voic of jonathan: and saul sware as the
lord liveth he shall not be slain

19:7 and jonathan call david and jonathan shew him all those
thing

and jonathan brought david to saul and he wa in hi presenc as in
time past

19:8 and there wa war again: and david went out and fought with the
philistin and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from
him

19:9 and the evil spirit from the lord wa upon saul as he sat in hi
hous with hi javelin in hi hand: and david play with hi hand

19:10 and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the
javelin: but he slip away out of saul presenc and he smote the
javelin into the wall: and david fled and escap that night

19:11 saul also sent messeng unto david hous to watch him and
to slay him in the morning: and michal david wife told him say
if thou save not thi life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain

19:12 so michal let david down through a window: and he went and
fled and escap

19:13 and michal took an imag and laid it in the bed and put a
pillow of goat hair for hi bolster and cover it with a cloth

19:14 and when saul sent messeng to take david she said he is
sick

19:15 and saul sent the messeng again to see david say bring
him up to me in the bed that i may slay him

19:16 and when the messeng were come in behold there wa an imag
in the bed with a pillow of goat hair for hi bolster

19:17 and saul said unto michal whi hast thou deceiv me so and
sent away mine enemi that he is escaped? and michal answer saul he
said unto me let me go; whi should i kill thee? 19:18 so david fled
and escap and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul
had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth

19:19 and it wa told saul say behold david is at naioth in
ramah

19:20 and saul sent messeng to take david: and when they saw the
compani of the prophet prophesi and samuel stand as appoint
over them the spirit of god wa upon the messeng of saul and they
also prophesi

19:21 and when it wa told saul he sent other messeng and they
prophesi likewis and saul sent messeng again the third time
and they prophesi also

19:22 then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in
sechu: and he ask and said where are samuel and david? and one
said behold they be at naioth in ramah

19:23 and he went thither to naioth in ramah: and the spirit of god
wa upon him also and he went on and prophesi until he came to
naioth in ramah

19:24 and he strip off hi cloth also and prophesi befor
samuel in like manner and lay down nake all that day and all that
night wherefor they say is saul also among the prophets? 20:1 and
david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said befor jonathan
what have i done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin befor thi
father that he seeketh my life? 20:2 and he said unto him god
forbid; thou shalt not die: behold my father will do noth either
great or small but that he will shew it me: and whi should my father
hide thi thing from me? it is not so

20:3 and david sware moreov and said thi father certainli knoweth
that i have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith let not jonathan
know thi lest he be grieved: but truli as the lord liveth and as
thi soul liveth there is but a step between me and death

20:4 then said jonathan unto david whatsoev thi soul desireth i
will even do it for thee

20:5 and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon
and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go
that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even

20:6 if thi father at all miss me then say david earnestli ask
leav of me that he might run to bethlehem hi city: for there is a
yearli sacrific there for all the famili

20:7 if he say thu it is well; thi servant shall have peace: but if
he be veri wroth then be sure that evil is determin by him

20:8 therefor thou shalt deal kindli with thi servant; for thou hast
brought thi servant into a coven of the lord with thee:
notwithstand if there be in me iniqu slay me thyself; for whi
shouldest thou bring me to thi father? 20:9 and jonathan said far be
it from thee: for if i knew certainli that evil were determin by my
father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee? 20:10 then
said david to jonathan who shall tell me? or what if thi father
answer thee roughly? 20:11 and jonathan said unto david come and
let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the
field

20:12 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have
sound my father about to morrow ani time or the third day and
behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee
and shew it thee; 20:13 the lord do so and much more to jonathan: but
if it pleas my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and
send thee away that thou mayest go in peace: and the lord be with
thee as he hath been with my father

20:14 and thou shalt not onli while yet i live shew me the kind of
the lord that i die not: 20:15 but also thou shalt not cut off thi
kind from my hous for ever: no not when the lord hath cut off
the enemi of david everi one from the face of the earth

20:16 so jonathan made a coven with the hous of david say let
the lord even requir it at the hand of david enemi

20:17 and jonathan caus david to swear again becaus he love him:
for he love him as he love hi own soul

20:18 then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon: and thou
shalt be miss becaus thi seat will be empti

20:19 and when thou hast stay three day then thou shalt go down
quickli and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
busi wa in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel

20:20 and i will shoot three arrow on the side thereof as though i
shot at a mark

20:21 and behold i will send a lad say go find out the arrow
if i expressli say unto the lad behold the arrow are on thi side
of thee take them; then come thou: for there is peac to thee and no
hurt; as the lord liveth

20:22 but if i say thu unto the young man behold the arrow are
beyond thee; go thi way: for the lord hath sent thee away

20:23 and as touch the matter which thou and i have spoken of
behold the lord be between thee and me for ever

20:24 so david hid himself in the field: and when the new moon wa
come the king sat him down to eat meat

20:25 and the king sat upon hi seat as at other time even upon a
seat by the wall: and jonathan aros and abner sat by saul side
and david place wa empti

20:26 nevertheless saul spake not ani thing that day: for he thought
someth hath befallen him he is not clean; sure he is not clean

20:27 and it came to pass on the morrow which wa the second day of
the month that david place wa empty: and saul said unto jonathan
hi son wherefor cometh not the son of jess to meat neither
yesterday nor to day? 20:28 and jonathan answer saul david
earnestli ask leav of me to go to bethlehem: 20:29 and he said let
me go i pray thee; for our famili hath a sacrific in the city; and
my brother he hath command me to be there: and now if i have found
favour in thine eye let me get away i pray thee and see my
brethren therefor he cometh not unto the king tabl

20:30 then saul anger wa kindl against jonathan and he said unto
him thou son of the pervers rebelli woman do not i know that
thou hast chosen the son of jess to thine own confus and unto the
confus of thi mother nakedness? 20:31 for as long as the son of
jess liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be establish nor thi
kingdom wherefor now send and fetch him unto me for he shall sure
die

20:32 and jonathan answer saul hi father and said unto him
wherefor shall he be slain? what hath he done? 20:33 and saul cast a
javelin at him to smite him: wherebi jonathan knew that it wa
determin of hi father to slay david

20:34 so jonathan aros from the tabl in fierc anger and did eat no
meat the second day of the month: for he wa griev for david
becaus hi father had done him shame

20:35 and it came to pass in the morn that jonathan went out into
the field at the time appoint with david and a littl lad with him

20:36 and he said unto hi lad run find out now the arrow which i
shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him

20:37 and when the lad wa come to the place of the arrow which
jonathan had shot jonathan cri after the lad and said is not the
arrow beyond thee? 20:38 and jonathan cri after the lad make
speed hast stay not and jonathan lad gather up the arrow and
came to hi master

20:39 but the lad knew not ani thing: onli jonathan and david knew the
matter

20:40 and jonathan gave hi artilleri unto hi lad and said unto him
go carri them to the citi

20:41 and as soon as the lad wa gone david aros out of a place
toward the south and fell on hi face to the ground and bow
himself three times: and they kiss one anoth and wept one with
anoth until david exceed

20:42 and jonathan said to david go in peac forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the lord say the lord be between
me and thee and between my seed and thi seed for ever and he aros
and departed: and jonathan went into the citi

21:1 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest: and ahimelech wa
afraid at the meet of david and said unto him whi art thou alon
and no man with thee? 21:2 and david said unto ahimelech the priest
the king hath command me a busi and hath said unto me let no
man know ani thing of the busi whereabout i send thee and what i
have command thee: and i have appoint my servant to such and such
a place

21:3 now therefor what is under thine hand? give me five loav of
bread in mine hand or what there is present

21:4 and the priest answer david and said there is no common bread
under mine hand but there is hallow bread; if the young men have
kept themselv at least from women

21:5 and david answer the priest and said unto him of a truth
women have been kept from us about these three day sinc i came out
and the vessel of the young men are holi and the bread is in a
manner common yea though it were sanctifi thi day in the vessel

21:6 so the priest gave him hallow bread: for there wa no bread
there but the shewbread that wa taken from befor the lord to put
hot bread in the day when it wa taken away

21:7 now a certain man of the servant of saul wa there that day
detain befor the lord; and hi name wa doeg an edomit the
chiefest of the herdmen that belong to saul

21:8 and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine
hand spear or sword? for i have neither brought my sword nor my
weapon with me becaus the king busi requir hast

21:9 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistin whom
thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrap in a
cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that take it: for there is
no other save that here and david said there is none like that; give
it me

21:10 and david aros and fled that day for fear of saul and went to
achish the king of gath

21:11 and the servant of achish said unto him is not thi david the
king of the land? did they not sing one to anoth of him in danc
say saul hath slain hi thousand and david hi ten thousands?
21:12 and david laid up these word in hi heart and wa sore afraid
of achish the king of gath

21:13 and he chang hi behaviour befor them and feign himself
mad in their hand and scrabbl on the door of the gate and let
hi spittl fall down upon hi beard

21:14 then said achish unto hi servant lo ye see the man is mad:
wherefor then have ye brought him to me? 21:15 have i need of mad
men that ye have brought thi fellow to play the mad man in my
presence? shall thi fellow come into my house? 22:1 david therefor
depart thenc and escap to the cave adullam: and when hi
brethren and all hi father hous heard it they went down thither
to him

22:2 and everi one that wa in distress and everi one that wa in
debt and everi one that wa discont gather themselv unto
him; and he becam a captain over them: and there were with him about
four hundr men

22:3 and david went thenc to mizpeh of moab: and he said unto the
king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth
and be with you till i know what god will do for me

22:4 and he brought them befor the king of moab: and they dwelt with
him all the while that david wa in the hold

22:5 and the prophet gad said unto david abid not in the hold;
depart and get thee into the land of judah then david depart and
came into the forest of hareth

22:6 when saul heard that david wa discov and the men that were

then saul said unto hi servant that stood about him hear now ye

vineyard and make you all captain of thousand and captain of
hundreds; 22:8 that all of you have conspir against me and there is
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a leagu with the son of
jess and there is none of you that is sorri for me or sheweth unto
me that my son hath stir up my servant against me to lie in wait

nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub

22:10 and he enquir of the lord for him and gave him victual and

22:13 and saul said unto him whi have ye conspir against me thou

for him? be it far from me: let not the king imput ani thing unto hi
servant nor to all the hous of my father: for thi servant knew
noth of all thi less or more

22:16 and the king said thou shalt sure die ahimelech thou and

22:17 and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn
and slay the priest of the lord: becaus their hand also is with
david and becaus they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me
but the servant of the king would not put forth their hand to fall

22:18 and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priest

22:19 and nob the citi of the priest smote he with the edg of the

22:20 and one of the son of ahimelech the son of ahitub name

22:21 and abiathar shew david that saul had slain the lord

22:22 and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the

the death of all the person of thi father hous

22:23 abid thou with me fear not: for he that seeketh my life

23:1 then they told david say behold the philistin fight
against keilah and they rob the threshingfloor

23:2 therefor david enquir of the lord say shall i go and
smite these philistines? and the lord said unto david go and smite
the philistin and save keilah

23:3 and david men said unto him behold we be afraid here in

23:9 and david knew that saul secretli practis mischief against him;
and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod

23:10 then said david o lord god of israel thi servant hath
certainli heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the

23:11 will the men of keilah deliv me up into hi hand? will saul

thee tell thi servant and the lord said he will come down

23:12 then said david will the men of keilah deliv me and my men

23:14 and david abod in the wilder in strong hold and remain

day but god deliv him not into hi hand

23:15 and david saw that saul wa come out to seek hi life: and david
wa in the wilder of ziph in a wood

23:16 and jonathan saul son aros and went to david into the wood
and strengthen hi hand in god

23:17 and he said unto him fear not: for the hand of saul my father
shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall
be next unto thee; and that also saul my father knoweth

23:18 and they two made a coven befor the lord: and david abod in
the wood and jonathan went to hi hous

23:19 then came up the ziphit to saul to gibeah say doth not
david hide himself with us in strong hold in the wood in the hill of
hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon? 23:20 now therefor o

and our part shall be to deliv him into the king hand

23:21 and saul said bless be ye of the lord; for ye have compass

land that i will search him out throughout all the thousand of

23:24 and they aros and went to ziph befor saul: but david and hi
men were in the wilder of maon in the plain on the south of
jeshimon

23:25 saul also and hi men went to seek him and they told david;
wherefor he came down into a rock and abod in the wilder of
maon and when saul heard that he pursu after david in the
wilder of maon

23:26 and saul went on thi side of the mountain and david and hi
men on that side of the mountain: and david made hast to get away for
fear of saul; for saul and hi men compass david and hi men round
about to take them

23:27 but there came a messeng unto saul say hast thee and
come; for the philistin have invad the land

23:28 wherefor saul return from pursu after david and went
against the philistines: therefor they call that place
selahammahlekoth

23:29 and david went up from thenc and dwelt in strong hold at
engedi

24:1 and it came to pass when saul wa return from follow the
philistin that it wa told him say behold david is in the
wilder of engedi

24:2 then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and
went to seek david and hi men upon the rock of the wild goat

24:3 and he came to the sheepcot by the way where wa a cave; and
saul went in to cover hi feet: and david and hi men remain in the
side of the cave

24:4 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the
lord said unto thee behold i will deliv thine enemi into thine
hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then
david aros and cut off the skirt of saul robe privili

24:5 and it came to pass afterward that david heart smote him
becaus he had cut off saul skirt

24:6 and he said unto hi men the lord forbid that i should do thi
thing unto my master the lord anoint to stretch forth mine hand
against him see he is the anoint of the lord

24:7 so david stay hi servant with these word and suffer them
not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went
on hi way

24:8 david also aros afterward and went out of the cave and cri
after saul say my lord the king and when saul look behind him
david stoop with hi face to the earth and bow himself

24:9 and david said to saul wherefor hearest thou men word
say behold david seeketh thi hurt? 24:10 behold thi day thine
eye have seen how that the lord had deliv thee to day into mine
hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spare
thee; and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for
he is the lord anoint

24:11 moreov my father see yea see the skirt of thi robe in my
hand: for in that i cut off the skirt of thi robe and kill thee
not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgress in
mine hand and i have not sin against thee; yet thou huntest my
soul to take it

24:12 the lord judg between me and thee and the lord aveng me of
thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee

24:13 as saith the proverb of the ancient wicked proceedeth from
the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee

24:14 after whom is the king of israel come out? after whom dost thou
pursue? after a dead dog after a flea

24:15 the lord therefor be judg and judg between me and thee and
see and plead my caus and deliv me out of thine hand

24:16 and it came to pass when david had made an end of speak
these word unto saul that saul said is thi thi voic my son
david? and saul lift up hi voic and wept

24:17 and he said to david thou art more righteou than i: for thou
hast reward me good wherea i have reward thee evil

24:18 and thou hast shew thi day how that thou hast dealt well with
me: forasmuch as when the lord had deliv me into thine hand thou
killedst me not

24:19 for if a man find hi enemi will he let him go well away?
wherefor the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me
thi day

24:20 and now behold i know well that thou shalt sure be king and
that the kingdom of israel shall be establish in thine hand

24:21 swear now therefor unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
father hous

24:22 and david sware unto saul and saul went home; but david and hi
men gat them up unto the hold

25:1 and samuel died; and all the israelit were gather togeth
and lament him and buri him in hi hous at ramah and david
aros and went down to the wilder of paran

25:2 and there wa a man in maon whose possess were in carmel;
and the man wa veri great and he had three thousand sheep and a
thousand goats: and he wa shear hi sheep in carmel

25:3 now the name of the man wa nabal; and the name of hi wife
abigail: and she wa a woman of good understand and of a beauti
countenance: but the man wa churlish and evil in hi doings; and he
wa of the hous of caleb

25:4 and david heard in the wilder that nabal did shear hi sheep

25:5 and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young
men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name:
25:6 and thu shall ye say to him that liveth in prosper peac be
both to thee and peac be to thine hous and peac be unto all that
thou hast

25:7 and now i have heard that thou hast shearers: now thi shepherd
which were with us we hurt them not neither wa there ought miss
unto them all the while they were in carmel

25:8 ask thi young men and they will shew thee wherefor let the
young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give
i pray thee whatsoev cometh to thine hand unto thi servant and to
thi son david

25:9 and when david young men came they spake to nabal accord to
all those word in the name of david and ceas

25:10 and nabal answer david servant and said who is david? and
who is the son of jesse? there be mani servant now a day that break
away everi man from hi master

25:11 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i
have kill for my shearer and give it unto men whom i know not
whenc they be? 25:12 so david young men turn their way and went
again and came and told him all those say

25:13 and david said unto hi men gird ye on everi man hi sword and
they gird on everi man hi sword; and david also gird on hi
sword: and there went up after david about four hundr men; and two
hundr abod by the stuff

25:14 but one of the young men told abigail nabal wife say
behold david sent messeng out of the wilder to salut our
master; and he rail on them

25:15 but the men were veri good unto us and we were not hurt
neither miss we ani thing as long as we were convers with them
when we were in the fields: 25:16 they were a wall unto us both by
night and day all the while we were with them keep the sheep

25:17 now therefor know and consid what thou wilt do; for evil is
determin against our master and against all hi household: for he
is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him

25:18 then abigail made hast and took two hundr loav and two
bottl of wine and five sheep readi dress and five measur of
parch corn and an hundr cluster of raisin and two hundr
cake of fig and laid them on ass

25:19 and she said unto her servant go on befor me; behold i come
after you but she told not her husband nabal

25:20 and it wa so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the
covert on the hill and behold david and hi men came down against
her; and she met them

25:21 now david had said sure in vain have i kept all that thi
fellow hath in the wilder so that noth wa miss of all that
pertain unto him: and he hath requit me evil for good

25:22 so and more also do god unto the enemi of david if i leav of
all that pertain to him by the morn light ani that pisseth against
the wall

25:23 and when abigail saw david she hast and light off the ass
and fell befor david on her face and bow herself to the ground
25:24 and fell at hi feet and said upon me my lord upon me let
thi iniqu be: and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine
audienc and hear the word of thine handmaid

25:25 let not my lord i pray thee regard thi man of belial even
nabal: for as hi name is so is he; nabal is hi name and folli is
with him: but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom
thou didst send

25:26 now therefor my lord as the lord liveth and as thi soul
liveth see the lord hath withholden thee from come to shed
blood and from aveng thyself with thine own hand now let thine
enemi and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal

25:27 and now thi bless which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord

25:28 i pray thee forgiv the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
lord will certainli make my lord a sure house; becaus my lord
fighteth the battl of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee
all thi day

25:29 yet a man is risen to pursu thee and to seek thi soul: but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundl of life with the lord thi
god; and the soul of thine enemi them shall he sling out as out
of the middl of a sling

25:30 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my
lord accord to all the good that he hath spoken concern thee
and shall have appoint thee ruler over israel; 25:31 that thi shall
be no grief unto thee nor offenc of heart unto my lord either that
thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath aveng himself:
but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then rememb
thine handmaid

25:32 and david said to abigail bless be the lord god of israel
which sent thee thi day to meet me: 25:33 and bless be thi advic
and bless be thou which hast kept me thi day from come to shed
blood and from aveng myself with mine own hand

25:34 for in veri deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath
kept me back from hurt thee except thou hadst hast and come to
meet me sure there had not been left unto nabal by the morn
light ani that pisseth against the wall

25:35 so david receiv of her hand that which she had brought him
and said unto her go up in peac to thine house; see i have
hearken to thi voic and have accept thi person

25:36 and abigail came to nabal; and behold he held a feast in hi
hous like the feast of a king; and nabal heart wa merri within
him for he wa veri drunken: wherefor she told him noth less or
more until the morn light

25:37 but it came to pass in the morn when the wine wa gone out
of nabal and hi wife had told him these thing that hi heart die
within him and he becam as a stone

25:38 and it came to pass about ten day after that the lord smote
nabal that he die

25:39 and when david heard that nabal wa dead he said bless be
the lord that hath plead the caus of my reproach from the hand of
nabal and hath kept hi servant from evil: for the lord hath return
the wicked of nabal upon hi own head and david sent and commun
with abigail to take her to him to wife

25:40 and when the servant of david were come to abigail to carmel
they spake unto her say david sent us unto thee to take thee to
him to wife

25:41 and she aros and bow herself on her face to the earth and
said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the
servant of my lord

25:42 and abigail hast and aros and rode upon an ass with five
damsel of her that went after her; and she went after the messeng
of david and becam hi wife

25:43 david also took ahinoam of jezreel; and they were also both of
them hi wive

25:44 but saul had given michal hi daughter david wife to phalti
the son of laish which wa of gallim

26:1 and the ziphit came unto saul to gibeah say doth not david
hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is befor jeshimon? 26:2
then saul aros and went down to the wilder of ziph have three
thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the
wilder of ziph

26:3 and saul pitch in the hill of hachilah which is befor
jeshimon by the way but david abod in the wilder and he saw
that saul came after him into the wilder

26:4 david therefor sent out spi and understood that saul wa come
in veri deed

26:5 and david aros and came to the place where saul had pitched:
and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner
the captain of hi host: and saul lay in the trench and the peopl
pitch round about him

26:6 then answer david and said to ahimelech the hittit and to
abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab say who will go down
with me to saul to the camp? and abishai said i will go down with
thee

26:7 so david and abishai came to the peopl by night: and behold
saul lay sleep within the trench and hi spear stuck in the ground
at hi bolster: but abner and the peopl lay round about him

26:8 then said abishai to david god hath deliv thine enemi into
thine hand thi day: now therefor let me smite him i pray thee with
the spear even to the earth at onc and i will not smite him the
second time

26:9 and david said to abishai destroy him not: for who can stretch
forth hi hand against the lord anoint and be guiltless? 26:10
david said furthermor as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him;
or hi day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battl and
perish

26:11 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against
the lord anointed: but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is
at hi bolster and the cruse of water and let us go

26:12 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul
bolster; and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it
neither awaked: for they were all asleep; becaus a deep sleep from
the lord wa fallen upon them

26:13 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of
an hill afar off; a great space be between them: 26:14 and david
cri to the peopl and to abner the son of ner say answerest
thou not abner? then abner answer and said who art thou that
criest to the king? 26:15 and david said to abner art not thou a
valiant man? and who is like to thee in israel? wherefor then hast
thou not kept thi lord the king? for there came one of the peopl in
to destroy the king thi lord

26:16 thi thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth
ye are worthi to die becaus ye have not kept your master the lord
anoint

and now see where the king spear is and the cruse of water that wa
at hi bolster

26:17 and saul knew david voic and said is thi thi voic my son
david? and david said it is my voic my lord o king

26:18 and he said wherefor doth my lord thu pursu after hi
servant? for what have i done? or what evil is in mine hand? 26:19
now therefor i pray thee let my lord the king hear the word of hi
servant if the lord have stir thee up against me let him accept
an offering: but if they be the children of men curs be they befor
the lord; for they have driven me out thi day from abid in the
inherit of the lord say go serv other god

26:20 now therefor let not my blood fall to the earth befor the
face of the lord: for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea
as when one doth hunt a partridg in the mountain

26:21 then said saul i have sinned: return my son david: for i will
no more do thee harm becaus my soul wa preciou in thine eye thi
day: behold i have play the fool and have er exceedingli

26:22 and david answer and said behold the king spear! and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it

26:23 the lord render to everi man hi righteous and hi
faithfulness; for the lord deliv thee into my hand to day but i
would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord anoint

26:24 and behold as thi life wa much set by thi day in mine eye
so let my life be much set by in the eye of the lord and let him
deliv me out of all tribul

26:25 then saul said to david bless be thou my son david: thou
shalt both do great thing and also shalt still prevail so david
went on hi way and saul return to hi place

27:1 and david said in hi heart i shall now perish one day by the
hand of saul: there is noth better for me than that i should
speedili escap into the land of the philistines; and saul shall
despair of me to seek me ani more in ani coast of israel: so shall i
escap out of hi hand

27:2 and david aros and he pass over with the six hundr men that
were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath

27:3 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and hi men everi man
with hi household even david with hi two wive ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabal wife

27:4 and it wa told saul that david wa fled to gath: and he sought
no more again for him

27:5 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine
eye let them give me a place in some town in the countri that i may
dwell there: for whi should thi servant dwell in the royal citi with
thee? 27:6 then achish gave him ziklag that day: wherefor ziklag
pertaineth unto the king of judah unto thi day

27:7 and the time that david dwelt in the countri of the philistin
wa a full year and four month

27:8 and david and hi men went up and invad the geshurit and
the gezrit and the amalekites: for those nation were of old the
inhabit of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of
egypt

27:9 and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman aliv
and took away the sheep and the oxen and the ass and the camel
and the apparel and return and came to achish

27:10 and achish said whither have ye made a road to day? and david
said against the south of judah and against the south of the
jerahmeelit and against the south of the kenit

27:11 and david save neither man nor woman aliv to bring tide to
gath say lest they should tell on us say so did david and
so will be hi manner all the while he dwelleth in the countri of the
philistin

27:12 and achish believ david say he hath made hi peopl
israel utterli to abhor him; therefor he shall be my servant for
ever

28:1 and it came to pass in those day that the philistin gather
their armi togeth for warfar to fight with israel and achish
said unto david know thou assuredli that thou shalt go out with me
to battl thou and thi men

28:2 and david said to achish sure thou shalt know what thi servant
can do and achish said to david therefor will i make thee keeper of
mine head for ever

28:3 now samuel wa dead and all israel had lament him and buri
him in ramah even in hi own citi and saul had put away those that
had familiar spirit and the wizard out of the land

28:4 and the philistin gather themselv togeth and came and
pitch in shunem: and saul gather all israel togeth and they
pitch in gilboa

28:5 and when saul saw the host of the philistin he wa afraid and
hi heart greatli trembl

28:6 and when saul enquir of the lord the lord answer him not
neither by dream nor by urim nor by prophet

28:7 then said saul unto hi servant seek me a woman that hath a
familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquir of her and hi
servant said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at endor

28:8 and saul disguis himself and put on other raiment and he
went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night: and
he said i pray thee divin unto me by the familiar spirit and bring
me him up whom i shall name unto thee

28:9 and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath
done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirit and the
wizard out of the land: wherefor then layest thou a snare for my
life to caus me to die? 28:10 and saul sware to her by the lord
say as the lord liveth there shall no punish happen to thee
for thi thing

28:11 then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee? and he
said bring me up samuel

28:12 and when the woman saw samuel she cri with a loud voice: and
the woman spake to saul say whi hast thou deceiv me? for thou
art saul

28:13 and the king said unto her be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
and the woman said unto saul i saw god ascend out of the earth

28:14 and he said unto her what form is he of? and she said an old
man cometh up; and he is cover with a mantl and saul perceiv
that it wa samuel and he stoop with hi face to the ground and
bow himself

28:15 and samuel said to saul whi hast thou disquiet me to bring
me up? and saul answer i am sore distressed; for the philistin
make war against me and god is depart from me and answereth me no
more neither by prophet nor by dreams: therefor i have call
thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do

28:16 then said samuel wherefor then dost thou ask of me see the
lord is depart from thee and is becom thine enemy? 28:17 and the
lord hath done to him as he spake by me: for the lord hath rent the
kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thi neighbour even to
david: 28:18 becaus thou obeyedst not the voic of the lord nor
executedst hi fierc wrath upon amalek therefor hath the lord done
thi thing unto thee thi day

28:19 moreov the lord will also deliv israel with thee into the
hand of the philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thi son be with
me: the lord also shall deliv the host of israel into the hand of
the philistin

28:20 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and wa sore
afraid becaus of the word of samuel: and there wa no strength in
him; for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night

28:21 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he wa sore troubl
and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obey thi voic and i
have put my life in my hand and have hearken unto thi word which
thou spakest unto me

28:22 now therefor i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voic of
thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread befor thee; and eat
that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thi way

28:23 but he refus and said i will not eat but hi servant
togeth with the woman compel him; and he hearken unto their
voic so he aros from the earth and sat upon the bed

28:24 and the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hast and
kill it and took flour and knead it and did bake unleaven
bread thereof: 28:25 and she brought it befor saul and befor hi
servants; and they did eat then they rose up and went away that
night

29:1 now the philistin gather togeth all their armi to aphek:
and the israelit pitch by a fountain which is in jezreel

29:2 and the lord of the philistin pass on by hundr and by
thousands: but david and hi men pass on in the rereward with
achish

29:3 then said the princ of the philistin what do these hebrew
here? and achish said unto the princ of the philistin is not
thi david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been
with me these day or these year and i have found no fault in him
sinc he fell unto me unto thi day? 29:4 and the princ of the
philistin were wroth with him; and the princ of the philistin
said unto him make thi fellow return that he may go again to hi
place which thou hast appoint him and let him not go down with us
to battl lest in the battl he be an adversari to us: for wherewith
should he reconcil himself unto hi master? should it not be with the
head of these men? 29:5 is not thi david of whom they sang one to
anoth in danc say saul slew hi thousand and david hi ten
thousands? 29:6 then achish call david and said unto him sure
as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thi go out and thi
come in with me in the host is good in my sight: for i have not
found evil in thee sinc the day of thi come unto me unto thi day:
nevertheless the lord favour thee not

29:7 wherefor now return and go in peac that thou displeas not
the lord of the philistin

29:8 and david said unto achish but what have i done? and what hast
thou found in thi servant so long as i have been with thee unto thi
day that i may not go fight against the enemi of my lord the king?
29:9 and achish answer and said to david i know that thou art good
in my sight as an angel of god: notwithstand the princ of the
philistin have said he shall not go up with us to the battl

29:10 wherefor now rise up earli in the morn with thi master
servant that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up earli in the
morn and have light depart

29:11 so david and hi men rose up earli to depart in the morn to
return into the land of the philistin and the philistin went up
to jezreel

30:1 and it came to pass when david and hi men were come to ziklag
on the third day that the amalekit had invad the south and
ziklag and smitten ziklag and burn it with fire; 30:2 and had
taken the women captiv that were therein: they slew not ani either
great or small but carri them away and went on their way

30:3 so david and hi men came to the citi and behold it wa burn
with fire; and their wive and their son and their daughter were
taken captiv

30:4 then david and the peopl that were with him lift up their
voic and wept until they had no more power to weep

30:5 and david two wive were taken captiv ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelit

30:6 and david wa greatli distressed; for the peopl spake of stone
him becaus the soul of all the peopl wa griev everi man for hi
son and for hi daughters: but david encourag himself in the lord
hi god

30:7 and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelech son i pray
thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the
ephod to david

30:8 and david enquir at the lord say shall i pursu after thi
troop? shall i overtak them? and he answer him pursue: for thou
shalt sure overtak them and without fail recov all

30:9 so david went he and the six hundr men that were with him and
came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stay

30:10 but david pursu he and four hundr men: for two hundr
abod behind which were so faint that they could not go over the
brook besor

30:11 and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to
david and gave him bread and he did eat; and they made him drink
water; 30:12 and they gave him a piec of a cake of fig and two
cluster of raisins: and when he had eaten hi spirit came again to
him: for he had eaten no bread nor drunk ani water three day and
three night

30:13 and david said unto him to whom belongest thou? and whenc art
thou? and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite;
and my master left me becaus three day agon i fell sick

30:14 we made an invas upon the south of the cherethit and upon
the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb; and
we burn ziklag with fire

30:15 and david said to him canst thou bring me down to thi company?
and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor
deliv me into the hand of my master and i will bring thee down to
thi compani

30:16 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread
abroad upon all the earth eat and drink and danc becaus
of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the
philistin and out of the land of judah

30:17 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the even of
the next day: and there escap not a man of them save four hundr
young men which rode upon camel and fled

30:18 and david recov all that the amalekit had carri away:
and david rescu hi two wive

30:19 and there wa noth lack to them neither small nor great
neither son nor daughter neither spoil nor ani thing that they had
taken to them: david recov all

30:20 and david took all the flock and the herd which they drave
befor those other cattl and said thi is david spoil

30:21 and david came to the two hundr men which were so faint that
they could not follow david whom they had made also to abid at the
brook besor: and they went forth to meet david and to meet the peopl
that were with him: and when david came near to the peopl he salut
them

30:22 then answer all the wick men and men of belial of those
that went with david and said becaus they went not with us we will
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recov save to everi
man hi wife and hi children that they may lead them away and
depart

30:23 then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that
which the lord hath given us who hath preserv us and deliv the
compani that came against us into our hand

30:24 for who will hearken unto you in thi matter? but as hi part is
that goeth down to the battl so shall hi part be that tarrieth by
the stuff: they shall part alik

30:25 and it wa so from that day forward that he made it a statut
and an ordin for israel unto thi day

30:26 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the
elder of judah even to hi friend say behold a present for you
of the spoil of the enemi of the lord; 30:27 to them which were in
bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were
in jattir 30:28 and to them which were in aroer and to them which
were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa 30:29 and to
them which were in rachal and to them which were in the citi of the
jerahmeelit and to them which were in the citi of the kenit
30:30 and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in
chorashan and to them which were in athach 30:31 and to them which
were in hebron and to all the place where david himself and hi men
were wont to haunt

31:1 now the philistin fought against israel: and the men of israel
fled from befor the philistin and fell down slain in mount gilboa

31:2 and the philistin follow hard upon saul and upon hi sons;
and the philistin slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua
saul son

31:3 and the battl went sore against saul and the archer hit him;
and he wa sore wound of the archer

31:4 then said saul unto hi armourbear draw thi sword and thrust
me through therewith; lest these uncircumcis come and thrust me
through and abus me but hi armourbear would not; for he wa sore
afraid therefor saul took a sword and fell upon it

31:5 and when hi armourbear saw that saul wa dead he fell
likewis upon hi sword and die with him

31:6 so saul die and hi three son and hi armourbear and all
hi men that same day togeth

31:7 and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the
valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men
of israel fled and that saul and hi son were dead they forsook the
citi and fled; and the philistin came and dwelt in them

31:8 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistin came to
strip the slain that they found saul and hi three son fallen in
mount gilboa

31:9 and they cut off hi head and strip off hi armour and sent
into the land of the philistin round about to publish it in the
hous of their idol and among the peopl

31:10 and they put hi armour in the hous of ashtaroth: and they
fasten hi bodi to the wall of bethshan

31:11 and when the inhabit of jabeshgilead heard of that which the
philistin had done to saul; 31:12 all the valiant men aros and
went all night and took the bodi of saul and the bodi of hi son
from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there

31:13 and they took their bone and buri them under a tree at
jabesh and fast seven day

the second book of the king


1:1 now it came to pass after the death of saul when david wa
return from the slaughter of the amalekit and david had abod two
day in ziklag; 1:2 it came even to pass on the third day that
behold a man came out of the camp from saul with hi cloth rent
and earth upon hi head: and so it wa when he came to david that he
fell to the earth and did obeis

1:3 and david said unto him from whenc comest thou? and he said unto
him out of the camp of israel am i escap

1:4 and david said unto him how went the matter? i pray thee tell
me

and he answer that the peopl are fled from the battl and mani of
the peopl also are fallen and dead; and saul and jonathan hi son are
dead also

1:5 and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou
that saul and jonathan hi son be dead? 1:6 and the young man that
told him said as i happen by chanc upon mount gilboa behold saul
lean upon hi spear; and lo the chariot and horsemen follow
hard after him

1:7 and when he look behind him he saw me and call unto me and
i answer here am i

1:8 and he said unto me who art thou? and i answer him i am an
amalekit

1:9 he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me:
for anguish is come upon me becaus my life is yet whole in me

1:10 so i stood upon him and slew him becaus i wa sure that he
could not live after that he wa fallen: and i took the crown that wa
upon hi head and the bracelet that wa on hi arm and have brought
them hither unto my lord

1:11 then david took hold on hi cloth and rent them; and likewis
all the men that were with him: 1:12 and they mourn and wept and
fast until even for saul and for jonathan hi son and for the
peopl of the lord and for the hous of israel; becaus they were
fallen by the sword

1:13 and david said unto the young man that told him whenc art thou?
and he answer i am the son of a stranger an amalekit

1:14 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the lord anointed? 1:15 and david
call one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and
he smote him that he die

1:16 and david said unto him thi blood be upon thi head; for thi
mouth hath testifi against thee say i have slain the lord
anoint

1:17 and david lament with thi lament over saul and over
jonathan hi son: 1:18 (also he bade them teach the children of judah
the use of the bow: behold it is written in the book of jasher)
1:19 the beauti of israel is slain upon thi high places: how are the
mighti fallen! 1:20 tell it not in gath publish it not in the
street of askelon; lest the daughter of the philistin rejoic
lest the daughter of the uncircumcis triumph

1:21 ye mountain of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be
rain upon you nor field of offerings: for there the shield of the
mighti is vile cast away the shield of saul as though he had not
been anoint with oil

1:22 from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighti the bow
of jonathan turn not back and the sword of saul return not empti

1:23 saul and jonathan were love and pleasant in their live and in
their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagl they
were stronger than lion

1:24 ye daughter of israel weep over saul who cloth you in
scarlet with other delight who put on ornament of gold upon your
apparel

1:25 how are the mighti fallen in the midst of the battle! o jonathan
thou wast slain in thine high place

1:26 i am distress for thee my brother jonathan: veri pleasant hast
thou been unto me: thi love to me wa wonder pass the love of
women

1:27 how are the mighti fallen and the weapon of war perished! 2:1
and it came to pass after thi that david enquir of the lord
say shall i go up into ani of the citi of judah? and the lord
said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up? and he
said unto hebron

2:2 so david went up thither and hi two wive also ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail nabal wife the carmelit

2:3 and hi men that were with him did david bring up everi man with
hi household: and they dwelt in the citi of hebron

2:4 and the men of judah came and there they anoint david king over
the hous of judah and they told david say that the men of
jabeshgilead were they that buri saul

2:5 and david sent messeng unto the men of jabeshgilead and said
unto them bless be ye of the lord that ye have shew thi
kind unto your lord even unto saul and have buri him

2:6 and now the lord shew kind and truth unto you: and i also will
requit you thi kind becaus ye have done thi thing

2:7 therefor now let your hand be strengthen and be ye valiant:
for your master saul is dead and also the hous of judah have
anoint me king over them

2:8 but abner the son of ner captain of saul host took ishbosheth
the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim; 2:9 and made him
king over gilead and over the ashurit and over jezreel and over
ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel

2:10 ishbosheth saul son wa forti year old when he began to reign
over israel and reign two year but the hous of judah follow
david

2:11 and the time that david wa king in hebron over the hous of
judah wa seven year and six month

2:12 and abner the son of ner and the servant of ishbosheth the son
of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon

2:13 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servant of david went out
and met togeth by the pool of gibeon: and they sat down the one on
the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool

2:14 and abner said to joab let the young men now aris and play
befor us and joab said let them aris

2:15 then there aros and went over by number twelv of benjamin
which pertain to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelv of the
servant of david

2:16 and they caught everi one hi fellow by the head and thrust hi
sword in hi fellow side; so they fell down together: wherefor that
place wa call helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon

2:17 and there wa a veri sore battl that day; and abner wa beaten
and the men of israel befor the servant of david

2:18 and there were three son of zeruiah there joab and abishai
and asahel: and asahel wa as light of foot as a wild roe

2:19 and asahel pursu after abner; and in go he turn not to the
right hand nor to the left from follow abner

2:20 then abner look behind him and said art thou asahel? and he
answer i am

2:21 and abner said to him turn thee asid to thi right hand or to
thi left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee hi
armour

but asahel would not turn asid from follow of him

2:22 and abner said again to asahel turn thee asid from follow
me: wherefor should i smite thee to the ground? how then should i
hold up my face to joab thi brother? 2:23 howbeit he refus to turn
aside: wherefor abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him
under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him; and he fell
down there and die in the same place: and it came to pass that as
mani as came to the place where asahel fell down and die stood still

2:24 joab also and abishai pursu after abner: and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth befor giah by
the way of the wilder of gibeon

2:25 and the children of benjamin gather themselv togeth after
abner and becam one troop and stood on the top of an hill

2:26 then abner call to joab and said shall the sword devour for
ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitter in the latter end?
how long shall it be then ere thou bid the peopl return from
follow their brethren? 2:27 and joab said as god liveth unless
thou hadst spoken sure then in the morn the peopl had gone up
everi one from follow hi brother

2:28 so joab blew a trumpet and all the peopl stood still and
pursu after israel no more neither fought they ani more

2:29 and abner and hi men walk all that night through the plain
and pass over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to
mahanaim

2:30 and joab return from follow abner: and when he had gather
all the peopl togeth there lack of david servant nineteen men
and asahel

2:31 but the servant of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner
men so that three hundr and threescor men die

2:32 and they took up asahel and buri him in the sepulchr of hi
father which wa in bethlehem and joab and hi men went all night
and they came to hebron at break of day

3:1 now there wa long war between the hous of saul and the hous of
david: but david wax stronger and stronger and the hous of saul
wax weaker and weaker

3:2 and unto david were son born in hebron: and hi firstborn wa
amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess; 3:3 and hi second chileab of
abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite; and the third absalom the
son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur; 3:4 and the
fourth adonijah the son of haggith; and the fifth shephatiah the son
of abital; 3:5 and the sixth ithream by eglah david wife these
were born to david in hebron

3:6 and it came to pass while there wa war between the hous of saul
and the hous of david that abner made himself strong for the hous
of saul

3:7 and saul had a concubin whose name wa rizpah the daughter of
aiah: and ishbosheth said to abner wherefor hast thou gone in unto
my father concubine? 3:8 then wa abner veri wroth for the word of
ishbosheth and said am i a dog head which against judah do shew
kind thi day unto the hous of saul thi father to hi brethren
and to hi friend and have not deliv thee into the hand of
david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concern thi
woman? 3:9 so do god to abner and more also except as the lord
hath sworn to david even so i do to him; 3:10 to translat the
kingdom from the hous of saul and to set up the throne of david over
israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba

3:11 and he could not answer abner a word again becaus he fear
him

3:12 and abner sent messeng to david on hi behalf say whose
is the land? say also make thi leagu with me and behold my
hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee

3:13 and he said well; i will make a leagu with thee: but one thing
i requir of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou
first bring michal saul daughter when thou comest to see my face

3:14 and david sent messeng to ishbosheth saul son say
deliv me my wife michal which i espous to me for an hundr
foreskin of the philistin

3:15 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from
phaltiel the son of laish

3:16 and her husband went with her along weep behind her to
bahurim

then said abner unto him go return and he return

3:17 and abner had commun with the elder of israel say ye
sought for david in time past to be king over you: 3:18 now then do
it: for the lord hath spoken of david say by the hand of my
servant david i will save my peopl israel out of the hand of the
philistin and out of the hand of all their enemi

3:19 and abner also spake in the ear of benjamin: and abner went also
to speak in the ear of david in hebron all that seem good to
israel and that seem good to the whole hous of benjamin

3:20 so abner came to david to hebron and twenti men with him and
david made abner and the men that were with him a feast

3:21 and abner said unto david i will aris and go and will gather
all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a leagu with
thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth
and david sent abner away; and he went in peac

3:22 and behold the servant of david and joab came from pursu a
troop and brought in a great spoil with them: but abner wa not with
david in hebron; for he had sent him away and he wa gone in peac

3:23 when joab and all the host that wa with him were come they told
joab say abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent
him away and he is gone in peac

3:24 then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done?
behold abner came unto thee; whi is it that thou hast sent him away
and he is quit gone? 3:25 thou knowest abner the son of ner that he
came to deceiv thee and to know thi go out and thi come in and
to know all that thou doest

3:26 and when joab wa come out from david he sent messeng after
abner which brought him again from the well of sirah: but david knew
it not

3:27 and when abner wa return to hebron joab took him asid in the
gate to speak with him quietli and smote him there under the fifth
rib that he die for the blood of asahel hi brother

3:28 and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are
guiltless befor the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of
ner: 3:29 let it rest on the head of joab and on all hi father
house; and let there not fail from the hous of joab one that hath an
issu or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth
on the sword or that lacketh bread

3:30 so joab and abishai hi brother slew abner becaus he had slain
their brother asahel at gibeon in the battl

3:31 and david said to joab and to all the peopl that were with him
rend your cloth and gird you with sackcloth and mourn befor
abner and king david himself follow the bier

3:32 and they buri abner in hebron: and the king lift up hi
voic and wept at the grave of abner; and all the peopl wept

3:33 and the king lament over abner and said die abner as a fool
dieth? 3:34 thi hand were not bound nor thi feet put into fetters:
as a man falleth befor wick men so fellest thou and all the
peopl wept again over him

3:35 and when all the peopl came to caus david to eat meat while it
wa yet day david sware say so do god to me and more also if i
tast bread or ought els till the sun be down

3:36 and all the peopl took notic of it and it pleas them: as
whatsoev the king did pleas all the peopl

3:37 for all the peopl and all israel understood that day that it wa
not of the king to slay abner the son of ner

3:38 and the king said unto hi servant know ye not that there is a
princ and a great man fallen thi day in israel? 3:39 and i am thi
day weak though anoint king; and these men the son of zeruiah be
too hard for me: the lord shall reward the doer of evil accord to
hi wicked

4:1 and when saul son heard that abner wa dead in hebron hi hand
were feebl and all the israelit were troubl

4:2 and saul son had two men that were captain of bands: the name
of the one wa baanah and the name of the other rechab the son of
rimmon a beerothit of the children of benjamin: (for beeroth also
wa reckon to benjamin

4:3 and the beerothit fled to gittaim and were sojourn there
until thi day) 4:4 and jonathan saul son had a son that wa
lame of hi feet he wa five year old when the tide came of saul
and jonathan out of jezreel and hi nurs took him up and fled: and
it came to pass as she made hast to flee that he fell and becam
lame and hi name wa mephibosheth

4:5 and the son of rimmon the beerothit rechab and baanah went
and came about the heat of the day to the hous of ishbosheth who lay
on a bed at noon

4:6 and they came thither into the midst of the hous as though they
would have fetch wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and
rechab and baanah hi brother escap

4:7 for when they came into the hous he lay on hi bed in hi
bedchamb and they smote him and slew him and behead him and
took hi head and gat them away through the plain all night

4:8 and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and
said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine
enemi which sought thi life; and the lord hath aveng my lord the
king thi day of saul and of hi seed

4:9 and david answer rechab and baanah hi brother the son of
rimmon the beerothit and said unto them as the lord liveth who
hath redeem my soul out of all advers 4:10 when one told me
say behold saul is dead think to have brought good tide i
took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would
have given him a reward for hi tidings: 4:11 how much more when
wick men have slain a righteou person in hi own hous upon hi
bed? shall i not therefor now requir hi blood of your hand and
take you away from the earth? 4:12 and david command hi young men
and they slew them and cut off their hand and their feet and hang
them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth
and buri it in the sepulchr of abner in hebron

5:1 then came all the tribe of israel to david unto hebron and
spake say behold we are thi bone and thi flesh

5:2 also in time past when saul wa king over us thou wast he that
leddest out and broughtest in israel: and the lord said to thee thou
shalt feed my peopl israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel

5:3 so all the elder of israel came to the king to hebron; and king
david made a leagu with them in hebron befor the lord: and they
anoint david king over israel

5:4 david wa thirti year old when he began to reign and he reign
forti year

5:5 in hebron he reign over judah seven year and six months: and in
jerusalem he reign thirti and three year over all israel and judah

5:6 and the king and hi men went to jerusalem unto the jebusit the
inhabit of the land: which spake unto david say except thou
take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither:
think david cannot come in hither

5:7 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion: the same is the
citi of david

5:8 and david said on that day whosoev getteth up to the gutter
and smiteth the jebusit and the lame and the blind that are hate
of david soul he shall be chief and captain wherefor they said
the blind and the lame shall not come into the hous

5:9 so david dwelt in the fort and call it the citi of david and
david built round about from millo and inward

5:10 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of host wa
with him

5:11 and hiram king of tyre sent messeng to david and cedar tree
and carpent and masons: and they built david an hous

5:12 and david perceiv that the lord had establish him king over
israel and that he had exalt hi kingdom for hi peopl israel

god of israel i anoint thee king over israel and i deliv thee
out of the hand of saul; 12:8 and i gave thee thi master hous and
thi master wive into thi bosom and gave thee the hous of israel
and of judah; and if that had been too littl i would moreov have

12:9 wherefor hast thou despis the command of the lord to do
evil in hi sight? thou hast kill uriah the hittit with the sword
and hast taken hi wife to be thi wife and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of ammon

12:10 now therefor the sword shall never depart from thine house;
becaus thou hast despis me and hast taken the wife of uriah the

12:13 and david said unto nathan i have sin against the lord and
nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thi sin; thou

them

12:18 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child die and
the servant of david fear to tell him that the child wa dead: for
they said behold while the child wa yet aliv we spake unto him
and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself
if we tell him that the child is dead? 12:19 but when david saw that
hi servant whisper david perceiv that the child wa dead:

but when the child wa dead thou didst rise and eat bread

12:22 and he said while the child wa yet aliv i fast and wept:
for i said who can tell whether god will be graciou to me that the
child may live? 12:23 but now he is dead wherefor should i fast?
can i bring him back again? i shall go to him but he shall not return
to me

12:24 and david comfort bathsheba hi wife and went in unto her
and lay with her: and she bare a son and he call hi name solomon:
and the lord love him

12:25 and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet; and he call hi

12:26 and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and
took the royal citi

12:27 and joab sent messeng to david and said i have fought

pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the
meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand

13:6 so amnon lay down and made himself sick: and when the king wa
come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my
sister come and make me a coupl of cake in my sight that i may eat
at her hand

13:7 then david sent home to tamar say go now to thi brother

went out everi man from him

13:10 and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that
i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cake which she had made
and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother

13:11 and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of
her and said unto her come lie with me my sister

13:12 and she answer him nay my brother do not forc me; for no
such thing ought to be done in israel: do not thou thi folli

13:13 and i whither shall i caus my shame to go? and as for thee
thou shalt be as one of the fool in israel now therefor i pray
thee speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee

13:14 howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but be stronger
than she forc her and lay with her

13:15 then amnon hate her exceedingly; so that the hatr wherewith
he hate her wa greater than the love wherewith he had love her and
amnon said unto her aris be gone

13:16 and she said unto him there is no cause: thi evil in send
me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he
would not hearken unto her

13:17 then he call hi servant that minist unto him and said
put now thi woman out from me and bolt the door after her

13:18 and she had a garment of diver colour upon her: for with such
robe were the king daughter that were virgin apparel then hi
servant brought her out and bolt the door after her

13:19 and tamar put ash on her head and rent her garment of diver
colour that wa on her and laid her hand on her head and went on
cri

13:20 and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thi brother
been with thee? but hold now thi peac my sister: he is thi brother;
regard not thi thing so tamar remain desol in her brother
absalom hous

13:21 but when king david heard of all these thing he wa veri
wroth

13:22 and absalom spake unto hi brother amnon neither good nor bad:
for absalom hate amnon becaus he had forc hi sister tamar

13:23 and it came to pass after two full year that absalom had
sheepshear in baalhazor which is besid ephraim: and absalom
invit all the king son

13:24 and absalom came to the king and said behold now thi servant
hath sheepshearers; let the king i beseech thee and hi servant go
with thi servant

13:25 and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now
go lest we be chargeabl unto thee and he press him: howbeit he
would not go but bless him

13:26 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go
with us and the king said unto him whi should he go with thee?
13:27 but absalom press him that he let amnon and all the king
son go with him

13:28 now absalom had command hi servant say mark ye now when
amnon heart is merri with wine and when i say unto you smite
amnon; then kill him fear not: have not i command you? be
courag and be valiant

13:29 and the servant of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had
command

then all the king son aros and everi man gat him up upon hi
mule and fled

13:30 and it came to pass while they were in the way that tide
came to david say absalom hath slain all the king son and
there is not one of them left

13:31 then the king aros and tare hi garment and lay on the
earth; and all hi servant stood by with their cloth rent

13:32 and jonadab the son of shimeah david brother answer and
said let not my lord suppos that they have slain all the young men
the king sons; for amnon onli is dead: for by the appoint of
absalom thi hath been determin from the day that he forc hi
sister tamar

13:33 now therefor let not my lord the king take the thing to hi
heart to think that all the king son are dead: for amnon onli is
dead

13:34 but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lift
up hi eye and look and behold there came much peopl by the
way of the hill side behind him

13:35 and jonadab said unto the king behold the king son come: as
thi servant said so it is

13:36 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speak
that behold the king son came and lift up their voic and
wept: and the king also and all hi servant wept veri sore

13:37 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king
of geshur and david mourn for hi son everi day

13:38 so absalom fled and went to geshur and wa there three year

13:39 and the soul of king david long to go forth unto absalom: for
he wa comfort concern amnon see he wa dead

14:1 now joab the son of zeruiah perceiv that the king heart wa
toward absalom

14:2 and joab sent to tekoah and fetch thenc a wise woman and
said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on
now mourn apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a
woman that had a long time mourn for the dead: 14:3 and come to the
king and speak on thi manner unto him so joab put the word in her
mouth

14:4 and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her
face to the ground and did obeis and said help o king

14:5 and the king said unto her what aileth thee? and she answer i
am inde a widow woman and mine husband is dead

14:6 and thi handmaid had two son and they two strove togeth in
the field and there wa none to part them but the one smote the
other and slew him

14:7 and behold the whole famili is risen against thine handmaid
and they said deliv him that smote hi brother that we may kill
him for the life of hi brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the
heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall
not leav to my husband neither name nor remaind upon the earth

14:8 and the king said unto the woman go to thine hous and i will
give charg concern thee

14:9 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the
iniqu be on me and on my father house: and the king and hi
throne be guiltless

14:10 and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to
me and he shall not touch thee ani more

14:11 then said she i pray thee let the king rememb the lord thi
god that thou wouldest not suffer the reveng of blood to destroy
ani more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth
there shall not one hair of thi son fall to the earth

14:12 then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one
word unto my lord the king and he said say on

14:13 and the woman said wherefor then hast thou thought such a
thing against the peopl of god? for the king doth speak thi thing as
one which is faulti in that the king doth not fetch home again hi
banish

14:14 for we must need die and are as water spilt on the ground
which cannot be gather up again; neither doth god respect ani
person: yet doth he devis mean that hi banish be not expel
from him

14:15 now therefor that i am come to speak of thi thing unto my lord
the king it is becaus the peopl have made me afraid: and thi
handmaid said i will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king
will perform the request of hi handmaid

14:16 for the king will hear to deliv hi handmaid out of the hand
of the man that would destroy me and my son togeth out of the
inherit of god

14:17 then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now
be comfortable: for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to
discern good and bad: therefor the lord thi god will be with thee

14:18 then the king answer and said unto the woman hide not from
me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said
let my lord the king now speak

14:19 and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all
this? and the woman answer and said as thi soul liveth my lord
the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought
that my lord the king hath spoken: for thi servant joab he bade me
and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid: 14:20 to
fetch about thi form of speech hath thi servant joab done thi thing:
and my lord is wise accord to the wisdom of an angel of god to
know all thing that are in the earth

14:21 and the king said unto joab behold now i have done thi thing:
go therefor bring the young man absalom again

14:22 and joab fell to the ground on hi face and bow himself and
thank the king: and joab said to day thi servant knoweth that i
have found grace in thi sight my lord o king in that the king hath
fulfil the request of hi servant

14:23 so joab aros and went to geshur and brought absalom to
jerusalem

14:24 and the king said let him turn to hi own hous and let him
not see my face so absalom return to hi own hous and saw not the
king face

14:25 but in all israel there wa none to be so much prais as
absalom for hi beauty: from the sole of hi foot even to the crown of
hi head there wa no blemish in him

14:26 and when he poll hi head (for it wa at everi year end
that he poll it: becaus the hair wa heavi on him therefor he
poll it:) he weigh the hair of hi head at two hundr shekel
after the king weight

14:27 and unto absalom there were born three son and one daughter
whose name wa tamar: she wa a woman of a fair counten

14:28 so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem and saw not the
king face

14:29 therefor absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time
he would not come

14:30 therefor he said unto hi servant see joab field is near
mine and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire and absalom
servant set the field on fire

14:31 then joab aros and came to absalom unto hi hous and said
unto him wherefor have thi servant set my field on fire? 14:32 and
absalom answer joab behold i sent unto thee say come hither
that i may send thee to the king to say wherefor am i come from
geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now
therefor let me see the king face; and if there be ani iniqu in
me let him kill me

14:33 so joab came to the king and told him: and when he had call
for absalom he came to the king and bow himself on hi face to the
ground befor the king: and the king kiss absalom

15:1 and it came to pass after thi that absalom prepar him
chariot and hors and fifti men to run befor him

15:2 and absalom rose up earli and stood besid the way of the gate:
and it wa so that when ani man that had a controversi came to the
king for judgment then absalom call unto him and said of what
citi art thou? and he said thi servant is of one of the tribe of
israel

15:3 and absalom said unto him see thi matter are good and right;
but there is no man deput of the king to hear thee

15:4 absalom said moreov oh that i were made judg in the land
that everi man which hath ani suit or caus might come unto me and i
would do him justice! 15:5 and it wa so that when ani man came nigh
to him to do him obeis he put forth hi hand and took him and
kiss him

15:6 and on thi manner did absalom to all israel that came to the
king for judgment: so absalom stole the heart of the men of israel

15:7 and it came to pass after forti year that absalom said unto the
king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vow unto
the lord in hebron

15:8 for thi servant vow a vow while i abod at geshur in syria
say if the lord shall bring me again inde to jerusalem then i
will serv the lord

15:9 and the king said unto him go in peac so he aros and went to
hebron

15:10 but absalom sent spi throughout all the tribe of israel
say as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall
say absalom reigneth in hebron

15:11 and with absalom went two hundr men out of jerusalem that
were called; and they went in their simplic and they knew not ani
thing

15:12 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonit david
counsellor from hi citi even from giloh while he offer
sacrific and the conspiraci wa strong; for the peopl increas
continu with absalom

15:13 and there came a messeng to david say the heart of the
men of israel are after absalom

15:14 and david said unto all hi servant that were with him at
jerusalem aris and let us flee; for we shall not els escap from
absalom: make speed to depart lest he overtak us suddenli and bring
evil upon us and smite the citi with the edg of the sword

15:15 and the king servant said unto the king behold thi servant
are readi to do whatsoev my lord the king shall appoint

15:16 and the king went forth and all hi household after him and
the king left ten women which were concubin to keep the hous

15:17 and the king went forth and all the peopl after him and
tarri in a place that wa far off

15:18 and all hi servant pass on besid him; and all the
cherethit and all the pelethit and all the gittit six hundr
men which came after him from gath pass on befor the king

15:19 then said the king to ittai the gittit wherefor goest thou
also with us? return to thi place and abid with the king: for thou
art a stranger and also an exil

15:20 wherea thou camest but yesterday should i thi day make thee
go up and down with us? see i go whither i may return thou and
take back thi brethren: merci and truth be with thee

15:21 and ittai answer the king and said as the lord liveth and
as my lord the king liveth sure in what place my lord the king
shall be whether in death or life even there also will thi servant
be

15:22 and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittit
pass over and all hi men and all the littl one that were with
him

15:23 and all the countri wept with a loud voic and all the peopl
pass over: the king also himself pass over the brook kidron and
all the peopl pass over toward the way of the wilder

15:24 and lo zadok also and all the levit were with him bear
the ark of the coven of god: and they set down the ark of god; and
abiathar went up until all the peopl had done pass out of the
citi

15:25 and the king said unto zadok carri back the ark of god into the
city: if i shall find favour in the eye of the lord he will bring me
again and shew me both it and hi habitation: 15:26 but if he thu
say i have no delight in thee; behold here am i let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him

15:27 the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer?
return into the citi in peac and your two son with you ahimaaz thi
son and jonathan the son of abiathar

15:28 see i will tarri in the plain of the wilder until there
come word from you to certifi me

15:29 zadok therefor and abiathar carri the ark of god again to
jerusalem: and they tarri there

15:30 and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he
went up and had hi head cover and he went barefoot: and all the
peopl that wa with him cover everi man hi head and they went up
weep as they went up

15:31 and one told david say ahithophel is among the conspir
with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of
ahithophel into foolish

15:32 and it came to pass that when david wa come to the top of the
mount where he worship god behold hushai the archit came to
meet him with hi coat rent and earth upon hi head: 15:33 unto whom
david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden
unto me: 15:34 but if thou return to the citi and say unto absalom i
will be thi servant o king; as i have been thi father servant
hitherto so will i now also be thi servant: then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of ahithophel

15:35 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the
priests? therefor it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt
hear out of the king hous thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar
the priest

15:36 behold they have there with them their two son ahimaaz
zadok son and jonathan abiathar son; and by them ye shall send
unto me everi thing that ye can hear

15:37 so hushai david friend came into the citi and absalom came
into jerusalem

16:1 and when david wa a littl past the top of the hill behold
ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a coupl of ass
saddl and upon them two hundr loav of bread and an hundr
bunch of raisin and an hundr of summer fruit and a bottl of
wine

16:2 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these? and ziba
said the ass be for the king household to ride on; and the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine that such as
be faint in the wilder may drink

16:3 and the king said and where is thi master son? and ziba said
unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem: for he said to day
shall the hous of israel restor me the kingdom of my father

16:4 then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertain
unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbl beseech thee that i may
find grace in thi sight my lord o king

16:5 and when king david came to bahurim behold thenc came out a
man of the famili of the hous of saul whose name wa shimei the son
of gera: he came forth and curs still as he came

16:6 and he cast stone at david and at all the servant of king
david: and all the peopl and all the mighti men were on hi right
hand and on hi left

16:7 and thu said shimei when he curs come out come out thou
bloodi man and thou man of belial: 16:8 the lord hath return upon
thee all the blood of the hous of saul in whose stead thou hast
reigned; and the lord hath deliv the kingdom into the hand of
absalom thi son: and behold thou art taken in thi mischief becaus
thou art a bloodi man

16:9 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king whi should
thi dead dog curs my lord the king? let me go over i pray thee and
take off hi head

16:10 and the king said what have i to do with you ye son of
zeruiah? so let him curs becaus the lord hath said unto him curs
david who shall then say wherefor hast thou done so? 16:11 and
david said to abishai and to all hi servant behold my son which
came forth of my bowel seeketh my life: how much more now may thi
benjamit do it? let him alon and let him curse; for the lord hath
bidden him

16:12 it may be that the lord will look on mine afflict and that
the lord will requit me good for hi curs thi day

16:13 and as david and hi men went by the way shimei went along on
the hill side over against him and curs as he went and threw
stone at him and cast dust

16:14 and the king and all the peopl that were with him came weari
and refresh themselv there

16:15 and absalom and all the peopl the men of israel came to
jerusalem and ahithophel with him

16:16 and it came to pass when hushai the archit david friend
wa come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the
king god save the king

16:17 and absalom said to hushai is thi thi kind to thi friend?
whi wentest thou not with thi friend? 16:18 and hushai said unto
absalom nay; but whom the lord and thi peopl and all the men of
israel choos hi will i be and with him will i abid

16:19 and again whom should i serve? should i not serv in the
presenc of hi son? as i have serv in thi father presenc so
will i be in thi presenc

16:20 then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we
shall do

16:21 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thi father
concubin which he hath left to keep the house; and all israel shall
hear that thou art abhor of thi father: then shall the hand of all
that are with thee be strong

16:22 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
absalom went in unto hi father concubin in the sight of all
israel

16:23 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counsel in those
day wa as if a man had enquir at the oracl of god: so wa all
the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom

17:1 moreov ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choos out
twelv thousand men and i will aris and pursu after david thi
night: 17:2 and i will come upon him while he is weari and weak
hand and will make him afraid: and all the peopl that are with him
shall flee; and i will smite the king only: 17:3 and i will bring back
all the peopl unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned: so all the peopl shall be in peac

17:4 and the say pleas absalom well and all the elder of
israel

17:5 then said absalom call now hushai the archit also and let us
hear likewis what he saith

17:6 and when hushai wa come to absalom absalom spake unto him
say ahithophel hath spoken after thi manner: shall we do after
hi saying? if not; speak thou

17:7 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath
given is not good at thi time

17:8 for said hushai thou knowest thi father and hi men that they
be mighti men and they be chafe in their mind as a bear rob of
her whelp in the field: and thi father is a man of war and will not
lodg with the peopl

17:9 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place: and it
will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that
whosoev heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the peopl
that follow absalom

17:10 and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a
lion shall utterli melt: for all israel knoweth that thi father is a
mighti man and they which be with him are valiant men

17:11 therefor i counsel that all israel be gener gather unto
thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude; and that thou go to battl in thine own person

17:12 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so
much as one

17:13 moreov if he be gotten into a citi then shall all israel
bring rope to that citi and we will draw it into the river until
there be not one small stone found there

17:14 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of
hushai the archit is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the
lord had appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the
intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom

17:15 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest thu
and thu did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel; and
thu and thu have i counsel

17:16 now therefor send quickli and tell david say lodg not
thi night in the plain of the wilder but speedili pass over;
lest the king be swallow up and all the peopl that are with him

17:17 now jonathan and ahimaaz stay by enrogel; for they might not
be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and
they went and told king david

17:18 nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom: but they went
both of them away quickli and came to a man hous in bahurim which
had a well in hi court; whither they went down

17:19 and the woman took and spread a cover over the well mouth
and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing wa not known

17:20 and when absalom servant came to the woman to the hous they
said where is ahimaaz and jonathan? and the woman said unto them
they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and
could not find them they return to jerusalem

17:21 and it came to pass after they were depart that they came up
out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david
aris and pass quickli over the water: for thu hath ahithophel
counsel against you

17:22 then david aros and all the peopl that were with him and
they pass over jordan: by the morn light there lack not one of
them that wa not gone over jordan

17:23 and when ahithophel saw that hi counsel wa not follow he
saddl hi ass and aros and gat him home to hi hous to hi
citi and put hi household in order and hang himself and die
and wa buri in the sepulchr of hi father

17:24 then david came to mahanaim and absalom pass over jordan he
and all the men of israel with him

17:25 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab:
which amasa wa a man son whose name wa ithra an israelit that
went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab
mother

17:26 so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead

17:27 and it came to pass when david wa come to mahanaim that shobi
the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the
son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadit of rogelim
17:28 brought bed and bason and earthen vessel and wheat and
barley and flour and parch corn and bean and lentil and
parch puls 17:29 and honey and butter and sheep and chees of
kine for david and for the peopl that were with him to eat: for
they said the peopl is hungri and weari and thirsti in the
wilder

18:1 and david number the peopl that were with him and set
captain of thousand and captain of hundr over them

18:2 and david sent forth a third part of the peopl under the hand of
joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah
joab brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittit
and the king said unto the peopl i will sure go forth with you
myself also

18:3 but the peopl answer thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
away they will not care for us; neither if half of us die will they
care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefor now
it is better that thou succour us out of the citi

18:4 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and
the king stood by the gate side and all the peopl came out by
hundr and by thousand

18:5 and the king command joab and abishai and ittai say deal
gentli for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the
peopl heard when the king gave all the captain charg concern
absalom

18:6 so the peopl went out into the field against israel: and the
battl wa in the wood of ephraim; 18:7 where the peopl of israel
were slain befor the servant of david and there wa there a great
slaughter that day of twenti thousand men

18:8 for the battl wa there scatter over the face of all the
country: and the wood devour more peopl that day than the sword
devour

18:9 and absalom met the servant of david and absalom rode upon a
mule and the mule went under the thick bough of a great oak and hi
head caught hold of the oak and he wa taken up between the heaven
and the earth; and the mule that wa under him went away

18:10 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw
absalom hang in an oak

18:11 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou
sawest him and whi didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and
i would have given thee ten shekel of silver and a girdl

18:12 and the man said unto joab though i should receiv a thousand
shekel of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand
against the king son: for in our hear the king charg thee and
abishai and ittai say bewar that none touch the young man
absalom

18:13 otherwis i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:
for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest
have set thyself against me

18:14 then said joab i may not tarri thu with thee and he took
three dart in hi hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom
while he wa yet aliv in the midst of the oak

18:15 and ten young men that bare joab armour compass about and
smote absalom and slew him

18:16 and joab blew the trumpet and the peopl return from pursu
after israel: for joab held back the peopl

18:17 and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the
wood and laid a veri great heap of stone upon him: and all israel
fled everi one to hi tent

18:18 now absalom in hi lifetim had taken and rear up for himself
a pillar which is in the king dale: for he said i have no son to
keep my name in remembrance: and he call the pillar after hi own
name: and it is call unto thi day absalom place

18:19 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the
king tide how that the lord hath aveng him of hi enemi

18:20 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tide thi day
but thou shalt bear tide anoth day: but thi day thou shalt bear

19:9 and all the peopl were at strife throughout all the tribe of

unto the king let not my lord imput iniqu unto me neither do
thou rememb that which thi servant did pervers the day that my
lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to

19:20 for thi servant doth know that i have sinned: therefor behold
i am come the first thi day of all the hous of joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king

19:21 but abishai the son of zeruiah answer and said shall not

of zeruiah that ye should thi day be adversari unto me? shall

ride thereon and go to the king; becaus thi servant is lame

19:27 and he hath slander thi servant unto my lord the king; but my
lord the king is as an angel of god: do therefor what is good in
thine eye

19:28 for all of my father hous were but dead men befor my lord
the king: yet didst thou set thi servant among them that did eat at
thine own tabl what right therefor have i yet to cri ani more unto
the king? 19:29 and the king said unto him whi speakest thou ani

19:30 and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all

19:32 now barzillai wa a veri age man even fourscor year old: and
he had provid the king of susten while he lay at mahanaim; for
he wa a veri great man

19:33 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i
will feed thee with me in jerusalem

19:34 and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that
i should go up with the king unto jerusalem? 19:35 i am thi day
fourscor year old: and can i discern between good and evil? can thi
servant tast what i eat or what i drink? can i hear ani more the
voic of sing men and sing women? wherefor then should thi
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 19:36 thi servant will
go a littl way over jordan with the king: and whi should the king
recompens it me with such a reward? 19:37 let thi servant i pray
thee turn back again that i may die in mine own citi and be buri

19:38 and the king answer chimham shall go over with me and i will
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoev thou
shalt requir of me that will i do for thee

19:39 and all the peopl went over jordan and when the king wa come
over the king kiss barzillai and bless him; and he return unto
hi own place

19:40 then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him:
and all the peopl of judah conduct the king and also half the
peopl of israel

19:41 and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said
unto the king whi have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee
away and have brought the king and hi household and all david
men with him over jordan? 19:42 and all the men of judah answer
the men of israel becaus the king is near of kin to us: wherefor
then be ye angri for thi matter? have we eaten at all of the king
cost? or hath he given us ani gift? 19:43 and the men of israel
answer the men of judah and said we have ten part in the king
and we have also more right in david than ye: whi then did ye despis
us that our advic should not be first had in bring back our king?
and the word of the men of judah were fiercer than the word of the
men of israel

20:1 and there happen to be there a man of belial whose name wa
sheba the son of bichri a benjamite: and he blew a trumpet and
said we have no part in david neither have we inherit in the son
of jesse: everi man to hi tent o israel

20:2 so everi man of israel went up from after david and follow
sheba the son of bichri: but the men of judah clave unto their king
from jordan even to jerusalem

20:3 and david came to hi hous at jerusalem; and the king took the
ten women hi concubin whom he had left to keep the hous and put
them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were
shut up unto the day of their death live in widowhood

20:4 then said the king to amasa assembl me the men of judah within
three day and be thou here present

20:5 so amasa went to assembl the men of judah: but he tarri longer
than the set time which he had appoint him

20:6 and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do
us more harm than did absalom: take thou thi lord servant and
pursu after him lest he get him fenc citi and escap us

20:7 and there went out after him joab men and the cherethit and
the pelethit and all the mighti men: and they went out of
jerusalem to pursu after sheba the son of bichri

20:8 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went
befor them and joab garment that he had put on wa gird unto
him and upon it a girdl with a sword fasten upon hi loin in the
sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out

20:9 and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother? and joab
took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him

20:10 but amasa took no heed to the sword that wa in joab hand: so
he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out hi bowel to
the ground and struck him not again; and he die so joab and abishai
hi brother pursu after sheba the son of bichri

20:11 and one of joab men stood by him and said he that favoureth
joab and he that is for david let him go after joab

20:12 and amasa wallow in blood in the midst of the highway and
when the man saw that all the peopl stood still he remov amasa out
of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw
that everi one that came by him stood still

20:13 when he wa remov out of the highway all the peopl went on
after joab to pursu after sheba the son of bichri

20:14 and he went through all the tribe of israel unto abel and to
bethmaachah and all the berites: and they were gather togeth and
went also after him

20:15 and they came and besieg him in abel of bethmaachah and they
cast up a bank against the citi and it stood in the trench: and all
the peopl that were with joab batter the wall to throw it down

20:16 then cri a wise woman out of the citi hear hear; say i pray
you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee

20:17 and when he wa come near unto her the woman said art thou
joab? and he answer i am he then she said unto him hear the
word of thine handmaid and he answer i do hear

20:18 then she spake say they were wont to speak in old time
say they shall sure ask counsel at abel: and so they end the
matter

20:19 i am one of them that are peaceabl and faith in israel: thou
seekest to destroy a citi and a mother in israel: whi wilt thou
swallow up the inherit of the lord? 20:20 and joab answer and
said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or
destroy

20:21 the matter is not so: but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son
of bichri by name hath lift up hi hand against the king even
against david: deliv him onli and i will depart from the citi and
the woman said unto joab behold hi head shall be thrown to thee
over the wall

20:22 then the woman went unto all the peopl in her wisdom and they
cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab
and he blew a trumpet and they retir from the citi everi man to
hi tent and joab return to jerusalem unto the king

20:23 now joab wa over all the host of israel: and benaiah the son of
jehoiada wa over the cherethit and over the pelethites: 20:24 and
adoram wa over the tribute: and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud wa
recorder: 20:25 and sheva wa scribe: and zadok and abiathar were the
priests: 20:26 and ira also the jairit wa a chief ruler about david

21:1 then there wa a famin in the day of david three year year
after year; and david enquir of the lord and the lord answer it
is for saul and for hi bloodi hous becaus he slew the gibeonit

21:2 and the king call the gibeonit and said unto them; (now the
gibeonit were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of
the amorites; and the children of israel had sworn unto them: and saul
sought to slay them in hi zeal to the children of israel and judah)
21:3 wherefor david said unto the gibeonit what shall i do for
you? and wherewith shall i make the aton that ye may bless the
inherit of the lord? 21:4 and the gibeonit said unto him we
will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of hi house; neither for us
shalt thou kill ani man in israel and he said what ye shall say
that will i do for you

21:5 and they answer the king the man that consum us and that
devis against us that we should be destroy from remain in ani
of the coast of israel 21:6 let seven men of hi son be deliv
unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul
whom the lord did choos and the king said i will give them

21:7 but the king spare mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of
saul becaus of the lord oath that wa between them between david
and jonathan the son of saul

21:8 but the king took the two son of rizpah the daughter of aiah
whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth; and the five son of
michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of
barzillai the meholathite: 21:9 and he deliv them into the hand
of the gibeonit and they hang them in the hill befor the lord:
and they fell all seven togeth and were put to death in the day of
harvest in the first day in the begin of barley harvest

21:10 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it
for her upon the rock from the begin of harvest until water
drop upon them out of heaven and suffer neither the bird of the
air to rest on them by day nor the beast of the field by night

21:11 and it wa told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the
concubin of saul had done

21:12 and david went and took the bone of saul and the bone of
jonathan hi son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them
from the street of bethshan where the philistin had hang them
when the philistin had slain saul in gilboa: 21:13 and he brought up
from thenc the bone of saul and the bone of jonathan hi son; and
they gather the bone of them that were hang

21:14 and the bone of saul and jonathan hi son buri they in the
countri of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchr of kish hi father: and
they perform all that the king command and after that god wa
intreat for the land

21:15 moreov the philistin had yet war again with israel; and
david went down and hi servant with him and fought against the
philistines: and david wax faint

21:16 and ishbibenob which wa of the son of the giant the weight
of whose spear weigh three hundr shekel of brass in weight he

21:17 but abishai the son of zeruiah succour him and smote the
philistin and kill him then the men of david sware unto him
say thou shalt go no more out with us to battl that thou quench
not the light of israel

21:18 and it came to pass after thi that there wa again a battl
with the philistin at gob: then sibbechai the hushathit slew saph
which wa of the son of the giant

21:19 and there wa again a battl in gob with the philistin where
elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemit slew the brother of
goliath the gittit the staff of whose spear wa like a weaver
beam

21:20 and there wa yet a battl in gath where wa a man of great
statur that had on everi hand six finger and on everi foot six
toe four and twenti in number; and he also wa born to the giant

21:21 and when he defi israel jonathan the son of shimeah the
brother of david slew him

21:22 these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand
of david and by the hand of hi servant

22:1 and david spake unto the lord the word of thi song in the day
that the lord had deliv him out of the hand of all hi enemi
and out of the hand of saul: 22:2 and he said the lord is my rock
and my fortress and my deliverer; 22:3 the god of my rock; in him
will i trust: he is my shield and the horn of my salvat my high
tower and my refug my saviour; thou savest me from violenc

22:4 i will call on the lord who is worthi to be praised: so shall i
be save from mine enemi

22:5 when the wave of death compass me the flood of ungodli men
made me afraid; 22:6 the sorrow of hell compass me about; the
snare of death prevent me; 22:7 in my distress i call upon the
lord and cri to my god: and he did hear my voic out of hi templ
and my cri did enter into hi ear

22:8 then the earth shook and trembled; the foundat of heaven
move and shook becaus he wa wroth

22:9 there went up a smoke out of hi nostril and fire out of hi
mouth devoured: coal were kindl by it

22:10 he bow the heaven also and came down; and dark wa under
hi feet

22:11 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly: and he wa seen upon the
wing of the wind

22:12 and he made dark pavilion round about him dark water and
thick cloud of the sky

22:13 through the bright befor him were coal of fire kindl

22:14 the lord thunder from heaven and the most high utter hi
voic

22:15 and he sent out arrow and scatter them; lightn and
discomfit them

22:16 and the channel of the sea appear the foundat of the
world were discov at the rebuk of the lord at the blast of
the breath of hi nostril

22:17 he sent from abov he took me; he drew me out of mani waters;
22:18 he deliv me from my strong enemi and from them that hate
me: for they were too strong for me

22:19 they prevent me in the day of my calamity: but the lord wa my
stay

22:20 he brought me forth also into a larg place: he deliv me
becaus he delight in me

22:21 the lord reward me accord to my righteousness: accord to
the clean of my hand hath he recompens me

22:22 for i have kept the way of the lord and have not wickedli
depart from my god

22:23 for all hi judgment were befor me: and as for hi statut i
did not depart from them

22:24 i wa also upright befor him and have kept myself from mine
iniqu

22:25 therefor the lord hath recompens me accord to my
righteousness; accord to my clean in hi eye sight

22:26 with the merci thou wilt shew thyself merci and with the
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright

22:27 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself unsavouri

22:28 and the afflict peopl thou wilt save: but thine eye are upon
the haughti that thou mayest bring them down

22:29 for thou art my lamp o lord: and the lord will lighten my
dark

22:30 for by thee i have run through a troop: by my god have i leap
over a wall

22:31 as for god hi way is perfect; the word of the lord is tried:
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him

22:32 for who is god save the lord? and who is a rock save our god?
22:33 god is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect

22:34 he maketh my feet like hind feet: and setteth me upon my high
place

22:35 he teacheth my hand to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arm

22:36 thou hast also given me the shield of thi salvation: and thi
gentl hath made me great

22:37 thou hast enlarg my step under me; so that my feet did not
slip

22:38 i have pursu mine enemi and destroy them; and turn not
again until i had consum them

22:39 and i have consum them and wound them that they could not
arise: yea they are fallen under my feet

22:40 for thou hast gird me with strength to battle: them that rose
up against me hast thou subdu under me

22:41 thou hast also given me the neck of mine enemi that i might
destroy them that hate me

22:42 they look but there wa none to save; even unto the lord but
he answer them not

22:43 then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did
stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad

22:44 thou also hast deliv me from the strive of my peopl
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a peopl which i knew not
shall serv me

22:45 stranger shall submit themselv unto me: as soon as they hear
they shall be obedi unto me

22:46 stranger shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their
close place

22:47 the lord liveth; and bless be my rock; and exalt be the god
of the rock of my salvat

22:48 it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the peopl
under me

22:49 and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
lift me up on high abov them that rose up against me: thou hast
deliv me from the violent man

22:50 therefor i will give thank unto thee o lord among the
heathen and i will sing prais unto thi name

22:51 he is the tower of salvat for hi king: and sheweth merci to
hi anoint unto david and to hi seed for evermor

23:1 now these be the last word of david david the son of jess
said and the man who wa rais up on high the anoint of the god
of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said 23:2 the spirit of
the lord spake by me and hi word wa in my tongu

23:3 the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that
ruleth over men must be just rule in the fear of god

23:4 and he shall be as the light of the morn when the sun riseth
even a morn without clouds; as the tender grass spring out of
the earth by clear shine after rain

23:5 although my hous be not so with god; yet he hath made with me an
everlast coven order in all thing and sure: for thi is all
my salvat and all my desir although he make it not to grow

23:6 but the son of belial shall be all of them as thorn thrust
away becaus they cannot be taken with hands: 23:7 but the man that
shall touch them must be fenc with iron and the staff of a spear;
and they shall be utterli burn with fire in the same place

23:8 these be the name of the mighti men whom david had: the
tachmonit that sat in the seat chief among the captains; the same
wa adino the eznite: he lift up hi spear against eight hundr whom
he slew at one time

23:9 and after him wa eleazar the son of dodo the ahohit one of the
three mighti men with david when they defi the philistin that
were there gather togeth to battl and the men of israel were
gone away: 23:10 he aros and smote the philistin until hi hand
wa weari and hi hand clave unto the sword: and the lord wrought a
great victori that day; and the peopl return after him onli to
spoil

23:11 and after him wa shammah the son of age the hararit and the
philistin were gather togeth into a troop where wa a piec of
ground full of lentiles: and the peopl fled from the philistin

23:12 but he stood in the midst of the ground and defend it and
slew the philistines: and the lord wrought a great victori

23:13 and three of the thirti chief went down and came to david in
the harvest time unto the cave of adullam: and the troop of the
philistin pitch in the valley of rephaim

23:14 and david wa then in an hold and the garrison of the
philistin wa then in bethlehem

23:15 and david long and said oh that one would give me drink of
the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate! 23:16 and
the three mighti men brake through the host of the philistin and
drew water out of the well of bethlehem that wa by the gate and
took it and brought it to david: nevertheless he would not drink
thereof but pour it out unto the lord

23:17 and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this:
is not thi the blood of the men that went in jeopardi of their lives?
therefor he would not drink it these thing did these three mighti
men

23:18 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah wa chief
among three and he lift up hi spear against three hundr and
slew them and had the name among three

23:19 wa he not most honour of three? therefor he wa their
captain: howbeit he attain not unto the first three

23:20 and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of
kabzeel who had done mani act he slew two lionlik men of moab: he
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
23:21 and he slew an egyptian a goodli man: and the egyptian had a
spear in hi hand; but he went down to him with a staff and pluck
the spear out of the egyptian hand and slew him with hi own spear

23:22 these thing did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name
among three mighti men

23:23 he wa more honour than the thirti but he attain not to
the first three and david set him over hi guard

23:24 asahel the brother of joab wa one of the thirty; elhanan the
son of dodo of bethlehem 23:25 shammah the harodit elika the

24:1 and again the anger of the lord wa kindl against israel and
he move david against them to say go number israel and judah

24:2 for the king said to joab the captain of the host which wa with
him go now through all the tribe of israel from dan even to
beersheba and number ye the peopl that i may know the number of the
peopl

24:3 and joab said unto the king now the lord thi god add unto the
peopl how mani soever they be an hundredfold and that the eye of
my lord the king may see it: but whi doth my lord the king delight in
thi thing? 24:4 notwithstand the king word prevail against
joab and against the captain of the host and joab and the captain
of the host went out from the presenc of the king to number the
peopl of israel

24:5 and they pass over jordan and pitch in aroer on the right
side of the citi that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and

tahtimhodshi; and they came to danjaan and about to zidon 24:7 and
came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the citi of the hivit
and of the canaanites: and they went out to the south of judah even
to beersheba

24:8 so when they had gone through all the land they came to
jerusalem at the end of nine month and twenti day

24:9 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the peopl unto the
king: and there were in israel eight hundr thousand valiant men that
drew the sword; and the men of judah were five hundr thousand men

24:10 and david heart smote him after that he had number the
peopl

and david said unto the lord i have sin greatli in that i have
done: and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniqu of thi
servant; for i have done veri foolishli

24:11 for when david wa up in the morn the word of the lord came
unto the prophet gad david seer say 24:12 go and say unto
david thu saith the lord i offer thee three things; choos thee one
of them that i may do it unto thee

24:13 so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall
seven year of famin come unto thee in thi land? or wilt thou flee
three month befor thine enemi while they pursu thee? or that
there be three day pestil in thi land? now advis and see what
answer i shall return to him that sent me

24:14 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait: let us fall now
into the hand of the lord; for hi merci are great: and let me not
fall into the hand of man

24:15 so the lord sent a pestil upon israel from the morn even
to the time appointed: and there die of the peopl from dan even to
beersheba seventi thousand men

24:16 and when the angel stretch out hi hand upon jerusalem to
destroy it the lord repent him of the evil and said to the angel
that destroy the peopl it is enough: stay now thine hand and the
angel of the lord wa by the threshingplac of araunah the jebusit

24:17 and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote
the peopl and said lo i have sin and i have done wickedly: but
these sheep what have they done? let thine hand i pray thee be
against me and against my father hous

24:18 and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear
an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusit

24:19 and david accord to the say of gad went up as the lord
command

24:20 and araunah look and saw the king and hi servant come on
toward him: and araunah went out and bow himself befor the king on
hi face upon the ground

24:21 and araunah said wherefor is my lord the king come to hi
servant? and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build
an altar unto the lord that the plagu may be stay from the peopl

24:22 and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer
up what seemeth good unto him: behold here be oxen for burnt
sacrific and thresh instrument and other instrument of the oxen
for wood

24:23 all these thing did araunah as a king give unto the king and
araunah said unto the king the lord thi god accept thee

24:24 and the king said unto araunah nay; but i will sure buy it of
thee at a price: neither will i offer burnt offer unto the lord my
god of that which doth cost me noth so david bought the
threshingfloor and the oxen for fifti shekel of silver

24:25 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offer burnt
offer and peac offer so the lord wa intreat for the land
and the plagu wa stay from israel

1:52 and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthi man there

1:53 so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar

2:1 now the day of david drew nigh that he should die; and he charg
solomon hi son say 2:2 i go the way of all the earth: be thou

hi word which he spake concern me say if thi children take
heed to their way to walk befor me in truth with all their heart and
with all their soul there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the

2:5 moreov thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me
and what he did to the two captain of the host of israel unto abner
the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and
shed the blood of war in peac and put the blood of war upon hi
girdl that wa about hi loin and in hi shoe that were on hi
feet

2:6 do therefor accord to thi wisdom and let not hi hoar head go
down to the grave in peac

2:7 but shew kind unto the son of barzillai the gileadit and
let them be of those that eat at thi table: for so they came to me
when i fled becaus of absalom thi brother

2:8 and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a
benjamit of bahurim which curs me with a grievou curs in the day
when i went to mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at jordan and i

the sword

2:9 now therefor hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but hi hoar head bring

2:10 so david slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi of

2:11 and the day that david reign over israel were forti years:
seven year reign he in hebron and thirti and three year reign
he in jerusalem

2:12 then sat solomon upon the throne of david hi father; and hi
kingdom wa establish greatli

2:13 and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of
solomon and she said comest thou peaceably? and he said peaceabl

2:14 he said moreov i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said

2:16 and now i ask one petit of thee deni me not and she said

2:17 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king (for he
will not say thee nay) that he give me abishag the shunammit to
wife

2:18 and bathsheba said well; i will speak for thee unto the king

2:19 bathsheba therefor went unto king solomon to speak unto him for
adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bow himself unto
her and sat down on hi throne and caus a seat to be set for the
king mother; and she sat on hi right hand

2:20 then she said i desir one small petit of thee; i pray thee

will not say thee nay

2:21 and she said let abishag the shunammit be given to adonijah thi
brother to wife

2:22 and king solomon answer and said unto hi mother and whi dost
thou ask abishag the shunammit for adonijah? ask for him the kingdom
also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him and for abiathar the
priest and for joab the son of zeruiah

2:23 then king solomon sware by the lord say god do so to me and
more also if adonijah have not spoken thi word against hi own life

2:24 now therefor as the lord liveth which hath establish me and
set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an
hous as he promis adonijah shall be put to death thi day

2:25 and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada;
and he fell upon him that he die

2:26 and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth
unto thine own fields; for thou art worthi of death: but i will not at
thi time put thee to death becaus thou barest the ark of the lord
god befor david my father and becaus thou hast been afflict in
all wherein my father wa afflict

2:27 so solomon thrust out abiathar from be priest unto the lord;
that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concern
the hous of eli in shiloh

2:28 then tide came to joab: for joab had turn after adonijah
though he turn not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacl
of the lord and caught hold on the horn of the altar

2:29 and it wa told king solomon that joab wa fled unto the
tabernacl of the lord; and behold he is by the altar then solomon
sent benaiah the son of jehoiada say go fall upon him

2:30 and benaiah came to the tabernacl of the lord and said unto
him thu saith the king come forth and he said nay; but i will die
here and benaiah brought the king word again say thu said joab
and thu he answer me

2:31 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon
him and buri him; that thou mayest take away the innoc blood
which joab shed from me and from the hous of my father

2:32 and the lord shall return hi blood upon hi own head who fell
upon two men more righteou and better than he and slew them with the
sword my father david not know thereof to wit abner the son of
ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether
captain of the host of judah

2:33 their blood shall therefor return upon the head of joab and
upon the head of hi seed for ever: but upon david and upon hi seed
and upon hi hous and upon hi throne shall there be peac for ever
from the lord

2:34 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and
slew him: and he wa buri in hi own hous in the wilder

2:35 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in hi room over the
host: and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar

2:36 and the king sent and call for shimei and said unto him build
thee an hous in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thenc
ani whither

2:37 for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over
the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt sure
die: thi blood shall be upon thine own head

2:38 and shimei said unto the king the say is good: as my lord the
king hath said so will thi servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem
mani day

2:39 and it came to pass at the end of three year that two of the
servant of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath
and they told shimei say behold thi servant be in gath

2:40 and shimei aros and saddl hi ass and went to gath to achish
to seek hi servants: and shimei went and brought hi servant from
gath

2:41 and it wa told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to
gath and wa come again

2:42 and the king sent and call for shimei and said unto him did i
not make thee to swear by the lord and protest unto thee say
know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad ani
whither that thou shalt sure die? and thou saidst unto me the word
that i have heard is good

2:43 whi then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the
command that i have charg thee with? 2:44 the king said
moreov to shimei thou knowest all the wicked which thine heart
is privi to that thou didst to david my father: therefor the lord
shall return thi wicked upon thine own head; 2:45 and king solomon
shall be bless and the throne of david shall be establish befor
the lord for ever

2:46 so the king command benaiah the son of jehoiada; which went
out and fell upon him that he die and the kingdom wa establish
in the hand of solomon

3:1 and solomon made affin with pharaoh king of egypt and took
pharaoh daughter and brought her into the citi of david until he
had made an end of build hi own hous and the hous of the lord
and the wall of jerusalem round about

3:2 onli the peopl sacrif in high place becaus there wa no
hous built unto the name of the lord until those day

3:3 and solomon love the lord walk in the statut of david hi
father: onli he sacrif and burnt incens in high place

3:4 and the king went to gibeon to sacrific there; for that wa the
great high place: a thousand burnt offer did solomon offer upon
that altar

3:5 in gibeon the lord appear to solomon in a dream by night: and
god said ask what i shall give thee

3:6 and solomon said thou hast shew unto thi servant david my
father great merci accord as he walk befor thee in truth and
in righteous and in upright of heart with thee; and thou hast
kept for him thi great kind that thou hast given him a son to
sit on hi throne as it is thi day

3:7 and now o lord my god thou hast made thi servant king instead of
david my father: and i am but a littl child: i know not how to go out
or come in

3:8 and thi servant is in the midst of thi peopl which thou hast
chosen a great peopl that cannot be number nor count for
multitud

3:9 give therefor thi servant an understand heart to judg thi
peopl that i may discern between good and bad: for who is abl to
judg thi thi so great a people? 3:10 and the speech pleas the
lord that solomon had ask thi thing

3:11 and god said unto him becaus thou hast ask thi thing and
hast not ask for thyself long life; neither hast ask rich for
thyself nor hast ask the life of thine enemies; but hast ask for
thyself understand to discern judgment; 3:12 behold i have done
accord to thi words: lo i have given thee a wise and an
understand heart; so that there wa none like thee befor thee
neither after thee shall ani aris like unto thee

3:13 and i have also given thee that which thou hast not ask both
rich and honour: so that there shall not be ani among the king
like unto thee all thi day

3:14 and if thou wilt walk in my way to keep my statut and my
command as thi father david did walk then i will lengthen thi
day

3:15 and solomon awoke; and behold it wa a dream and he came to
jerusalem and stood befor the ark of the coven of the lord and
offer up burnt offer and offer peac offer and made a
feast to all hi servant

3:16 then came there two women that were harlot unto the king and

not my son which i did bear

3:22 and the other woman said nay; but the live is my son and the
dead is thi son and thi said no; but the dead is thi son and the
live is my son thu they spake befor the king

3:23 then said the king the one saith thi is my son that liveth
and thi son is the dead: and the other saith nay; but thi son is the
dead and my son is the live

3:24 and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword
befor the king

my father could not build an hous unto the name of the lord hi god
for the war which were about him on everi side until the lord put

5:5 and behold i purpos to build an hous unto the name of the lord
my god as the lord spake unto david my father say thi son whom
i will set upon thi throne in thi room he shall build an hous unto

5:6 now therefor command thou that they hew me cedar tree out of
lebanon; and my servant shall be with thi servants: and unto thee
will i give hire for thi servant accord to all that thou shalt
appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us ani that can
skill to hew timber like unto the sidonian

5:7 and it came to pass when hiram heard the word of solomon that

8:18 and the lord said unto david my father wherea it wa in thine
heart to build an hous unto my name thou didst well that it wa in

8:21 and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the coven
of the lord which he made with our father when he brought them out

8:22 and solomon stood befor the altar of the lord in the presenc of
all the congreg of israel and spread forth hi hand toward
heaven: 8:23 and he said lord god of israel there is no god like
thee in heaven abov or on earth beneath who keepest coven and
merci with thi servant that walk befor thee with all their heart:
8:24 who hast kept with thi servant david my father that thou
promisedst him: thou spakest also with thi mouth and hast fulfil

8:25 therefor now lord god of israel keep with thi servant david my
father that thou promisedst him say there shall not fail thee a
man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel; so that thi children
take heed to their way that they walk befor me as thou hast walk

8:26 and now o god of israel let thi word i pray thee be verifi
which thou spakest unto thi servant david my father

8:27 but will god inde dwell on the earth? behold the heaven and
heaven of heaven cannot contain thee; how much less thi hous that i

servant and to hi supplic o lord my god to hearken unto the
cri and to the prayer which thi servant prayeth befor thee to day:
8:29 that thine eye may be open toward thi hous night and day even
toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there: that
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thi servant shall make
toward thi place

8:30 and hearken thou to the supplic of thi servant and of thi
peopl israel when they shall pray toward thi place: and hear thou

8:31 if ani man trespass against hi neighbour and an oath be laid

8:33 when thi peopl israel be smitten down befor the enemi becaus
they have sin against thee and shall turn again to thee and
confess thi name and pray and make supplic unto thee in thi
house: 8:34 then hear thou in heaven and forgiv the sin of thi
peopl israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
unto their father

8:35 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain becaus they have
sin against thee; if they pray toward thi place and confess thi
name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them: 8:36 then
hear thou in heaven and forgiv the sin of thi servant and of thi
peopl israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should
walk and give rain upon thi land which thou hast given to thi peopl
for an inherit

8:37 if there be in the land famin if there be pestil blast
mildew locust or if there be caterpiller; if their enemi besieg

sick there be; 8:38 what prayer and supplic soever be made by
ani man or by all thi peopl israel which shall know everi man the
plagu of hi own heart and spread forth hi hand toward thi house:
8:39 then hear thou in heaven thi dwell place and forgiv and do
and give to everi man accord to hi way whose heart thou knowest;
(for thou even thou onli knowest the heart of all the children of
men;) 8:40 that they may fear thee all the day that they live in the
land which thou gavest unto our father

8:41 moreov concern a stranger that is not of thi peopl israel
but cometh out of a far countri for thi name sake; 8:42 (for they

8:43 hear thou in heaven thi dwell place and do accord to all
that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all peopl of the earth
may know thi name to fear thee as do thi peopl israel; and that

8:44 if thi peopl go out to battl against their enemi whithersoev
thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the citi
which thou hast chosen and toward the hous that i have built for thi
name: 8:45 then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their
supplic and maintain their caus

8:46 if they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not)
and thou be angri with them and deliv them to the enemi so that
they carri them away captiv unto the land of the enemi far or near;
8:47 yet if they shall bethink themselv in the land whither they
were carri captiv and repent and make supplic unto thee in
the land of them that carri them captiv say we have sin
and have done pervers we have commit wickedness; 8:48 and so
return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the
land of their enemi which led them away captiv and pray unto thee
toward their land which thou gavest unto their father the citi
which thou hast chosen and the hous which i have built for thi name:
8:49 then hear thou their prayer and their supplic in heaven thi

that have sin against thee and all their transgress wherein
they have transgress against thee and give them compass befor
them who carri them captiv that they may have compass on them:
8:51 for they be thi peopl and thine inherit which thou
broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnac of iron:
8:52 that thine eye may be open unto the supplic of thi servant
and unto the supplic of thi peopl israel to hearken unto them
in all that they call for unto thee

8:53 for thou didst separ them from among all the peopl of the
earth to be thine inherit as thou spakest by the hand of mose
thi servant when thou broughtest our father out of egypt o lord
god

8:54 and it wa so that when solomon had made an end of pray all
thi prayer and supplic unto the lord he aros from befor the
altar of the lord from kneel on hi knee with hi hand spread up
to heaven

8:55 and he stood and bless all the congreg of israel with a

not leav us nor forsak us: 8:58 that he may inclin our heart unto
him to walk in all hi way and to keep hi command and hi
statut and hi judgment which he command our father

8:59 and let these my word wherewith i have made supplic befor
the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he
maintain the caus of hi servant and the caus of hi peopl israel
at all time as the matter shall require: 8:60 that all the peopl of
the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none els

8:61 let your heart therefor be perfect with the lord our god to
walk in hi statut and to keep hi command as at thi day

8:62 and the king and all israel with him offer sacrific befor
the lord

8:63 and solomon offer a sacrific of peac offer which he
offer unto the lord two and twenti thousand oxen and an hundr
and twenti thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel

8:64 the same day did the king hallow the middl of the court that wa

and meat offer and the fat of the peac offerings: becaus the
brasen altar that wa befor the lord wa too littl to receiv the
burnt offer and meat offer and the fat of the peac
offer

8:65 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a
great congreg from the enter in of hamath unto the river of
egypt befor the lord our god seven day and seven day even
fourteen day

8:66 on the eighth day he sent the peopl away: and they bless the
king and went unto their tent joy and glad of heart for all the
good that the lord had done for david hi servant and for israel

9:1 and it came to pass when solomon had finish the build of the
hous of the lord and the king hous and all solomon desir
which he wa pleas to do 9:2 that the lord appear to solomon the
second time as he had appear unto him at gibeon

9:3 and the lord said unto him i have heard thi prayer and thi

hous which thou hast built to put my name there for ever; and mine
eye and mine heart shall be there perpetu

9:4 and if thou wilt walk befor me as david thi father walk in
integr of heart and in upright to do accord to all that i
have command thee and wilt keep my statut and my judgments: 9:5
then i will establish the throne of thi kingdom upon israel for ever
as i promis to david thi father say there shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of israel

9:6 but if ye shall at all turn from follow me ye or your
children and will not keep my command and my statut which i
have set befor you but go and serv other god and worship them:
9:7 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given
them; and thi hous which i have hallow for my name will i cast
out of my sight; and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people: 9:8 and at thi hous which is high everi one that passeth
by it shall be astonish and shall hiss; and they shall say whi
hath the lord done thu unto thi land and to thi house? 9:9 and
they shall answer becaus they forsook the lord their god who
brought forth their father out of the land of egypt and have taken
hold upon other god and have worship them and serv them:
therefor hath the lord brought upon them all thi evil

9:10 and it came to pass at the end of twenti year when solomon had
built the two hous the hous of the lord and the king hous
9:11 (now hiram the king of tyre had furnish solomon with cedar
tree and fir tree and with gold accord to all hi desire) that
then king solomon gave hiram twenti citi in the land of galile

9:12 and hiram came out from tyre to see the citi which solomon had
given him; and they pleas him not

9:13 and he said what citi are these which thou hast given me my
brother? and he call them the land of cabul unto thi day

9:14 and hiram sent to the king sixscor talent of gold

9:15 and thi is the reason of the levi which king solomon raised; for
to build the hous of the lord and hi own hous and millo and the
wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer

9:16 for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt
it with fire and slain the canaanit that dwelt in the citi and
given it for a present unto hi daughter solomon wife

9:17 and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether 9:18 and
baalath and tadmor in the wilder in the land 9:19 and all the
citi of store that solomon had and citi for hi chariot and
citi for hi horsemen and that which solomon desir to build in
jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of hi dominion

9:20 and all the peopl that were left of the amorit hittit
perizzit hivit and jebusit which were not of the children of
israel 9:21 their children that were left after them in the land
whom the children of israel also were not abl utterli to destroy
upon those did solomon levi a tribut of bondservic unto thi day

9:22 but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen: but
they were men of war and hi servant and hi princ and hi
captain and ruler of hi chariot and hi horsemen

9:23 these were the chief of the offic that were over solomon
work five hundr and fifti which bare rule over the peopl that
wrought in the work

9:24 but pharaoh daughter came up out of the citi of david unto her
hous which solomon had built for her: then did he build millo

9:25 and three time in a year did solomon offer burnt offer and
peac offer upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he
burnt incens upon the altar that wa befor the lord so he finish
the hous

9:26 and king solomon made a navi of ship in eziongeb which is
besid eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom

9:27 and hiram sent in the navi hi servant shipmen that had
knowledg of the sea with the servant of solomon

9:28 and they came to ophir and fetch from thenc gold four
hundr and twenti talent and brought it to king solomon

10:1 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon
concern the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard
question

10:2 and she came to jerusalem with a veri great train with camel
that bare spice and veri much gold and preciou stones: and when
she wa come to solomon she commun with him of all that wa in her
heart

10:3 and solomon told her all her questions: there wa not ani thing
hid from the king which he told her not

10:4 and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon wisdom and
the hous that he had built 10:5 and the meat of hi tabl and the
sit of hi servant and the attend of hi minist and
their apparel and hi cupbear and hi ascent by which he went up
unto the hous of the lord; there wa no more spirit in her

10:6 and she said to the king it wa a true report that i heard in
mine own land of thi act and of thi wisdom

10:7 howbeit i believ not the word until i came and mine eye had
seen it: and behold the half wa not told me: thi wisdom and
prosper exceedeth the fame which i heard

10:8 happi are thi men happi are these thi servant which stand
continu befor thee and that hear thi wisdom

10:9 bless be the lord thi god which delight in thee to set thee
on the throne of israel: becaus the lord love israel for ever
therefor made he thee king to do judgment and justic

10:10 and she gave the king an hundr and twenti talent of gold and
of spice veri great store and preciou stones: there came no more
such abund of spice as these which the queen of sheba gave to
king solomon

10:11 and the navi also of hiram that brought gold from ophir
brought in from ophir great plenti of almug tree and preciou
stone

10:12 and the king made of the almug tree pillar for the hous of
the lord and for the king hous harp also and psalteri for
singers: there came no such almug tree nor were seen unto thi day

10:13 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desir
whatsoev she ask besid that which solomon gave her of hi royal
bounti

so she turn and went to her own countri she and her servant

10:14 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year wa six
hundr threescor and six talent of gold 10:15 besid that he had
of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchant and of
all the king of arabia and of the governor of the countri

10:16 and king solomon made two hundr target of beaten gold: six
hundr shekel of gold went to one target

10:17 and he made three hundr shield of beaten gold; three pound of
gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the hous of the
forest of lebanon

10:18 moreov the king made a great throne of ivori and overlaid it
with the best gold

10:19 the throne had six step and the top of the throne wa round
behind: and there were stay on either side on the place of the seat
and two lion stood besid the stay

10:20 and twelv lion stood there on the one side and on the other
upon the six steps: there wa not the like made in ani kingdom

10:21 and all king solomon drink vessel were of gold and all
the vessel of the hous of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold;
none were of silver: it wa noth account of in the day of
solomon

10:22 for the king had at sea a navi of tharshish with the navi of
hiram: onc in three year came the navi of tharshish bring gold
and silver ivori and ape and peacock

10:23 so king solomon exceed all the king of the earth for rich
and for wisdom

10:24 and all the earth sought to solomon to hear hi wisdom which
god had put in hi heart

10:25 and they brought everi man hi present vessel of silver and
vessel of gold and garment and armour and spice hors and
mule a rate year by year

10:26 and solomon gather togeth chariot and horsemen: and he had
a thousand and four hundr chariot and twelv thousand horsemen
whom he bestow in the citi for chariot and with the king at
jerusalem

10:27 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stone and
cedar made he to be as the sycomor tree that are in the vale for
abund

10:28 and solomon had hors brought out of egypt and linen yarn: the
king merchant receiv the linen yarn at a price

10:29 and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundr
shekel of silver and an hors for an hundr and fifty: and so for
all the king of the hittit and for the king of syria did they
bring them out by their mean

11:1 but king solomon love mani strang women togeth with the
daughter of pharaoh women of the moabit ammonit edomit
zidonian and hittites: 11:2 of the nation concern which the lord
said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither
shall they come in unto you: for sure they will turn away your heart
after their gods: solomon clave unto these in love

11:3 and he had seven hundr wive princess and three hundr
concubines: and hi wive turn away hi heart

11:4 for it came to pass when solomon wa old that hi wive turn
away hi heart after other gods: and hi heart wa not perfect with
the lord hi god as wa the heart of david hi father

11:5 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonian
and after milcom the abomin of the ammonit

11:6 and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fulli
after the lord as did david hi father

11:7 then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomin
of moab in the hill that is befor jerusalem and for molech the
abomin of the children of ammon

11:8 and likewis did he for all hi strang wive which burnt
incens and sacrif unto their god

11:9 and the lord wa angri with solomon becaus hi heart wa turn
from the lord god of israel which had appear unto him twice 11:10
and had command him concern thi thing that he should not go
after other gods: but he kept not that which the lord command

11:11 wherefor the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as thi is done
of thee and thou hast not kept my coven and my statut which i
have command thee i will sure rend the kingdom from thee and
will give it to thi servant

11:12 notwithstand in thi day i will not do it for david thi
father sake: but i will rend it out of the hand of thi son

11:13 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
tribe to thi son for david my servant sake and for jerusalem sake
which i have chosen

11:14 and the lord stir up an adversari unto solomon hadad the
edomite: he wa of the king seed in edom

11:15 for it came to pass when david wa in edom and joab the
captain of the host wa gone up to buri the slain after he had
smitten everi male in edom; 11:16 (for six month did joab remain
there with all israel until he had cut off everi male in edom:) 11:17
that hadad fled he and certain edomit of hi father servant with
him to go into egypt; hadad be yet a littl child

11:18 and they aros out of midian and came to paran: and they took
men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king
of egypt; which gave him an hous and appoint him victual and
gave him land

11:19 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he
gave him to wife the sister of hi own wife the sister of tahpen
the queen

11:20 and the sister of tahpen bare him genubath hi son whom
tahpen wean in pharaoh house: and genubath wa in pharaoh
household among the son of pharaoh

11:21 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with hi father
and that joab the captain of the host wa dead hadad said to pharaoh
let me depart that i may go to mine own countri

11:22 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lack with me
that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country? and he
answer nothing: howbeit let me go in ani wise

11:23 and god stir him up anoth adversari rezon the son of
eliadah which fled from hi lord hadadez king of zobah: 11:24 and
he gather men unto him and becam captain over a band when david
slew them of zobah: and they went to damascu and dwelt therein and
reign in damascu

11:25 and he wa an adversari to israel all the day of solomon
besid the mischief that hadad did: and he abhor israel and
reign over syria

11:26 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathit of zereda
solomon servant whose mother name wa zeruah a widow woman even
he lift up hi hand against the king

11:27 and thi wa the caus that he lift up hi hand against the
king: solomon built millo and repair the breach of the citi of
david hi father

11:28 and the man jeroboam wa a mighti man of valour: and solomon
see the young man that he wa industri he made him ruler over
all the charg of the hous of joseph

11:29 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of
jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonit found him in the way;
and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alon in
the field: 11:30 and ahijah caught the new garment that wa on him
and rent it in twelv pieces: 11:31 and he said to jeroboam take thee
ten pieces: for thu saith the lord the god of israel behold i will
rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribe
to thee: 11:32 (but he shall have one tribe for my servant david
sake and for jerusalem sake the citi which i have chosen out of
all the tribe of israel:) 11:33 becaus that they have forsaken me
and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonian chemosh
the god of the moabit and milcom the god of the children of ammon
and have not walk in my way to do that which is right in mine
eye and to keep my statut and my judgment as did david hi
father

11:34 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of hi hand: but i
will make him princ all the day of hi life for david my servant
sake whom i chose becaus he kept my command and my statutes:
11:35 but i will take the kingdom out of hi son hand and will give
it unto thee even ten tribe

11:36 and unto hi son will i give one tribe that david my servant
may have a light alway befor me in jerusalem the citi which i have
chosen me to put my name there

11:37 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign accord to all that
thi soul desireth and shalt be king over israel

11:38 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command
thee and wilt walk in my way and do that is right in my sight to
keep my statut and my command as david my servant did; that i
will be with thee and build thee a sure hous as i built for david
and will give israel unto thee

11:39 and i will for thi afflict the seed of david but not for ever

11:40 solomon sought therefor to kill jeroboam and jeroboam aros
and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and wa in egypt
until the death of solomon

11:41 and the rest of the act of solomon and all that he did and
hi wisdom are they not written in the book of the act of solomon?
11:42 and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel
wa forti year

11:43 and solomon slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi
of david hi father: and rehoboam hi son reign in hi stead

12:1 and rehoboam went to shechem: for all israel were come to shechem
to make him king

12:2 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who wa yet
in egypt heard of it (for he wa fled from the presenc of king
solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt;) 12:3 that they sent and call
him and jeroboam and all the congreg of israel came and spake
unto rehoboam say 12:4 thi father made our yoke grievous: now
therefor make thou the grievou servic of thi father and hi heavi
yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serv thee

12:5 and he said unto them depart yet for three day then come again
to me and the peopl depart

12:6 and king rehoboam consult with the old men that stood befor
solomon hi father while he yet live and said how do ye advis that
i may answer thi people? 12:7 and they spake unto him say if
thou wilt be a servant unto thi peopl thi day and wilt serv them
and answer them and speak good word to them then they will be thi
servant for ever

12:8 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given
him and consult with the young men that were grown up with him and
which stood befor him: 12:9 and he said unto them what counsel give
ye that we may answer thi peopl who have spoken to me say make
the yoke which thi father did put upon us lighter? 12:10 and the
young men that were grown up with him spake unto him say thu
shalt thou speak unto thi peopl that spake unto thee say thi
father made our yoke heavi but make thou it lighter unto us; thu
shalt thou say unto them my littl finger shall be thicker than my
father loin

12:11 and now wherea my father did lade you with a heavi yoke i will
add to your yoke: my father hath chastis you with whip but i will
chastis you with scorpion

12:12 so jeroboam and all the peopl came to rehoboam the third day
as the king had appoint say come to me again the third day

12:13 and the king answer the peopl roughli and forsook the old
men counsel that they gave him; 12:14 and spake to them after the
counsel of the young men say my father made your yoke heavi and
i will add to your yoke: my father also chastis you with whip but
i will chastis you with scorpion

12:15 wherefor the king hearken not unto the people; for the caus
wa from the lord that he might perform hi say which the lord
spake by ahijah the shilonit unto jeroboam the son of nebat

12:16 so when all israel saw that the king hearken not unto them
the peopl answer the king say what portion have we in david?
neither have we inherit in the son of jesse: to your tent o
israel: now see to thine own hous david so israel depart unto
their tent

12:17 but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the citi of
judah rehoboam reign over them

12:18 then king rehoboam sent adoram who wa over the tribute; and
all israel stone him with stone that he die therefor king
rehoboam made speed to get him up to hi chariot to flee to
jerusalem

12:19 so israel rebel against the hous of david unto thi day

12:20 and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam wa
come again that they sent and call him unto the congreg and
made him king over all israel: there wa none that follow the hous
of david but the tribe of judah onli

12:21 and when rehoboam wa come to jerusalem he assembl all the
hous of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundr and fourscor
thousand chosen men which were warrior to fight against the hous
of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon

12:22 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god say
12:23 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto
all the hous of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the peopl
say 12:24 thu saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight
against your brethren the children of israel: return everi man to hi
house; for thi thing is from me they hearken therefor to the word
of the lord and return to depart accord to the word of the
lord

12:25 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein;
and went out from thenc and built penuel

12:26 and jeroboam said in hi heart now shall the kingdom return to
the hous of david: 12:27 if thi peopl go up to do sacrific in the
hous of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of thi peopl
turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they
shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah

12:28 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calv of gold
and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem:
behold thi god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of
egypt

12:29 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan

12:30 and thi thing becam a sin: for the peopl went to worship
befor the one even unto dan

12:31 and he made an hous of high place and made priest of the
lowest of the peopl which were not of the son of levi

12:32 and jeroboam ordain a feast in the eighth month on the
fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and
he offer upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrif unto the
calv that he had made: and he place in bethel the priest of the
high place which he had made

12:33 so he offer upon the altar which he had made in bethel the
fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had
devis of hi own heart; and ordain a feast unto the children of
israel: and he offer upon the altar and burnt incens

13:1 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of
the lord unto bethel: and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incens

13:2 and he cri against the altar in the word of the lord and said
o altar altar thu saith the lord; behold a child shall be born
unto the hous of david josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer
the priest of the high place that burn incens upon thee and men
bone shall be burnt upon thee

13:3 and he gave a sign the same day say thi is the sign which
the lord hath spoken; behold the altar shall be rent and the ash
that are upon it shall be pour out

13:4 and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the say of the
man of god which had cri against the altar in bethel that he put
forth hi hand from the altar say lay hold on him and hi hand
which he put forth against him dri up so that he could not pull it
in again to him

13:5 the altar also wa rent and the ash pour out from the altar
accord to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of
the lord

13:6 and the king answer and said unto the man of god intreat now
the face of the lord thi god and pray for me that my hand may be
restor me again and the man of god besought the lord and the
king hand wa restor him again and becam as it wa befor

13:7 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and
refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward

13:8 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half
thine hous i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor
drink water in thi place: 13:9 for so wa it charg me by the word
of the lord say eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by
the same way that thou camest

13:10 so he went anoth way and return not by the way that he came
to bethel

13:11 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel; and hi son came and
told him all the work that the man of god had done that day in
bethel: the word which he had spoken unto the king them they told
also to their father

13:12 and their father said unto them what way went he? for hi son
had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah

13:13 and he said unto hi son saddl me the ass so they saddl
him the ass: and he rode thereon 13:14 and went after the man of god
and found him sit under an oak: and he said unto him art thou the
man of god that camest from judah? and he said i am

13:15 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread

13:16 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee:
neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in thi place:
13:17 for it wa said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no
bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou
camest

13:18 he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
spake unto me by the word of the lord say bring him back with
thee into thine hous that he may eat bread and drink water but he
lie unto him

13:19 so he went back with him and did eat bread in hi hous and
drank water

13:20 and it came to pass as they sat at the tabl that the word of
the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back: 13:21 and he
cri unto the man of god that came from judah say thu saith the
lord forasmuch as thou hast disobey the mouth of the lord and hast
not kept the command which the lord thi god command thee 13:22
but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of
the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water;
thi carcas shall not come unto the sepulchr of thi father

13:23 and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had
drunk that he saddl for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom
he had brought back

13:24 and when he wa gone a lion met him by the way and slew him:
and hi carcas wa cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion
also stood by the carcas

13:25 and behold men pass by and saw the carcas cast in the way
and the lion stand by the carcase: and they came and told it in the
citi where the old prophet dwelt

13:26 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
thereof he said it is the man of god who wa disobedi unto the
word of the lord: therefor the lord hath deliv him unto the lion
which hath torn him and slain him accord to the word of the lord
which he spake unto him

13:27 and he spake to hi son say saddl me the ass and they
saddl him

13:28 and he went and found hi carcas cast in the way and the ass
and the lion stand by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the
carcas nor torn the ass

13:29 and the prophet took up the carcas of the man of god and laid
it upon the ass and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the
citi to mourn and to buri him

13:30 and he laid hi carcas in hi own grave; and they mourn over
him say ala my brother! 13:31 and it came to pass after he
had buri him that he spake to hi son say when i am dead
then buri me in the sepulchr wherein the man of god is buried; lay my
bone besid hi bones: 13:32 for the say which he cri by the
word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the
hous of the high place which are in the citi of samaria shall
sure come to pass

13:33 after thi thing jeroboam return not from hi evil way but
made again of the lowest of the peopl priest of the high places:
whosoev would he consecr him and he becam one of the priest
of the high place

13:34 and thi thing becam sin unto the hous of jeroboam even to
cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth

14:1 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick

14:2 and jeroboam said to hi wife aris i pray thee and disguis
thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam; and get
thee to shiloh: behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me
that i should be king over thi peopl

14:3 and take with thee ten loav and cracknel and a cruse of
honey and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall becom of the
child

14:4 and jeroboam wife did so and aros and went to shiloh and
came to the hous of ahijah but ahijah could not see; for hi eye
were set by reason of hi age

14:5 and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thu and
thu shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be when she cometh in
that she shall feign herself to be anoth woman

14:6 and it wa so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she
came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam; whi
feignest thou thyself to be another? for i am sent to thee with heavi
tide

14:7 go tell jeroboam thu saith the lord god of israel forasmuch
as i exalt thee from among the peopl and made thee princ over my
peopl israel 14:8 and rent the kingdom away from the hous of david
and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who
kept my command and who follow me with all hi heart to do
that onli which wa right in mine eyes; 14:9 but hast done evil abov
all that were befor thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other
god and molten imag to provok me to anger and hast cast me
behind thi back: 14:10 therefor behold i will bring evil upon the
hous of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth
against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will
take away the remnant of the hous of jeroboam as a man taketh away
dung till it be all gone

14:11 him that dieth of jeroboam in the citi shall the dog eat; and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat: for the
lord hath spoken it

14:12 aris thou therefor get thee to thine own house: and when thi
feet enter into the citi the child shall die

14:13 and all israel shall mourn for him and buri him: for he onli of
jeroboam shall come to the grave becaus in him there is found some
good thing toward the lord god of israel in the hous of jeroboam

14:14 moreov the lord shall rais him up a king over israel who
shall cut off the hous of jeroboam that day: but what? even now

behold i am gather two stick that i may go in and dress it for
me and my son that we may eat it and die

17:13 and elijah said unto her fear not; go and do as thou hast said:
but make me thereof a littl cake first and bring it unto me and
after make for thee and for thi son

17:14 for thu saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall
not wast neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the
lord sendeth rain upon the earth

17:15 and she went and did accord to the say of elijah: and she
and he and her hous did eat mani day

17:16 and the barrel of meal wast not neither did the cruse of oil
fail accord to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah

17:17 and it came to pass after these thing that the son of the
woman the mistress of the hous fell sick; and hi sick wa so
sore that there wa no breath left in him

17:18 and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou
man of god? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembr and
to slay my son? 17:19 and he said unto her give me thi son and he
took him out of her bosom and carri him up into a loft where he

son? 17:21 and he stretch himself upon the child three time and
cri unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let thi
child soul come into him again

17:22 and the lord heard the voic of elijah; and the soul of the
child came into him again and he reviv

17:23 and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the
chamber into the hous and deliv him unto hi mother: and elijah
said see thi son liveth

17:24 and the woman said to elijah now by thi i know that thou art a
man of god and that the word of the lord in thi mouth is truth

18:1 and it came to pass after mani day that the word of the lord
came to elijah in the third year say go shew thyself unto ahab;
and i will send rain upon the earth

18:2 and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there wa a sore
famin in samaria

18:3 and ahab call obadiah which wa the governor of hi hous
(now obadiah fear the lord greatly: 18:4 for it wa so when jezebel
cut off the prophet of the lord that obadiah took an hundr
prophet and hid them by fifti in a cave and fed them with bread and
water) 18:5 and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all
fountain of water and unto all brooks: peradventur we may find
grass to save the hors and mule aliv that we lose not all the
beast

18:6 so they divid the land between them to pass throughout it: ahab
went one way by himself and obadiah went anoth way by himself

18:7 and as obadiah wa in the way behold elijah met him: and he
knew him and fell on hi face and said art thou that my lord
elijah? 18:8 and he answer him i am: go tell thi lord behold
elijah is here

18:9 and he said what have i sin that thou wouldest deliv thi
servant into the hand of ahab to slay me? 18:10 as the lord thi god
liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent
to seek thee: and when they said he is not there; he took an oath of
the kingdom and nation that they found thee not

18:11 and now thou sayest go tell thi lord behold elijah is here

18:12 and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that
the spirit of the lord shall carri thee whither i know not; and so
when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me:
but i thi servant fear the lord from my youth

18:13 wa it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the
prophet of the lord how i hid an hundr men of the lord prophet
by fifti in a cave and fed them with bread and water? 18:14 and now
thou sayest go tell thi lord behold elijah is here: and he shall
slay me

18:15 and elijah said as the lord of host liveth befor whom i
stand i will sure shew myself unto him to day

18:16 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him: and ahab went to
meet elijah

18:17 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto
him art thou he that troubleth israel? 18:18 and he answer i have
not troubl israel; but thou and thi father hous in that ye have
forsaken the command of the lord and thou hast follow baalim

18:19 now therefor send and gather to me all israel unto mount
carmel and the prophet of baal four hundr and fifti and the
prophet of the grove four hundr which eat at jezebel tabl

18:20 so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gather the
prophet togeth unto mount carmel

18:21 and elijah came unto all the peopl and said how long halt ye
between two opinions? if the lord be god follow him: but if baal
then follow him and the peopl answer him not a word

18:22 then said elijah unto the peopl i even i onli remain a
prophet of the lord; but baal prophet are four hundr and fifti
men

18:23 let them therefor give us two bullocks; and let them choos one
bullock for themselv and cut it in piec and lay it on wood and
put no fire under: and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on
wood and put no fire under: 18:24 and call ye on the name of your
god and i will call on the name of the lord: and the god that
answereth by fire let him be god and all the peopl answer and
said it is well spoken

18:25 and elijah said unto the prophet of baal choos you one
bullock for yourselv and dress it first; for ye are many; and call
on the name of your god but put no fire under

18:26 and they took the bullock which wa given them and they dress
it and call on the name of baal from morn even until noon
say o baal hear us but there wa no voic nor ani that
answer and they leap upon the altar which wa made

18:27 and it came to pass at noon that elijah mock them and said
cri aloud: for he is a god; either he is talk or he is pursu
or he is in a journey or peradventur he sleepeth and must be
awak

18:28 and they cri aloud and cut themselv after their manner with
knive and lancet till the blood gush out upon them

18:29 and it came to pass when midday wa past and they prophesi
until the time of the offer of the even sacrific that there
wa neither voic nor ani to answer nor ani that regard

18:30 and elijah said unto all the peopl come near unto me and all
the peopl came near unto him and he repair the altar of the lord
that wa broken down

18:31 and elijah took twelv stone accord to the number of the
tribe of the son of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came
say israel shall be thi name: 18:32 and with the stone he built
an altar in the name of the lord: and he made a trench about the
altar as great as would contain two measur of seed

18:33 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in piec and
laid him on the wood and said fill four barrel with water and pour
it on the burnt sacrific and on the wood

18:34 and he said do it the second time and they did it the second
time

and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time

18:35 and the water ran round about the altar; and he fill the
trench also with water

18:36 and it came to pass at the time of the offer of the even
sacrific that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of
abraham isaac and of israel let it be known thi day that thou art
god in israel and that i am thi servant and that i have done all
these thing at thi word

18:37 hear me o lord hear me that thi peopl may know that thou
art the lord god and that thou hast turn their heart back again

18:38 then the fire of the lord fell and consum the burnt
sacrific and the wood and the stone and the dust and lick up
the water that wa in the trench

18:39 and when all the peopl saw it they fell on their faces: and
they said the lord he is the god; the lord he is the god

18:40 and elijah said unto them take the prophet of baal; let not
one of them escap and they took them: and elijah brought them down
to the brook kishon and slew them there

18:41 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink; for there
is a sound of abund of rain

18:42 so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the
top of carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth and put hi
face between hi knee 18:43 and said to hi servant go up now look
toward the sea and he went up and look and said there is
noth and he said go again seven time

18:44 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold
there ariseth a littl cloud out of the sea like a man hand and he
said go up say unto ahab prepar thi chariot and get thee down
that the rain stop thee not

18:45 and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven wa black
with cloud and wind and there wa a great rain and ahab rode and
went to jezreel

18:46 and the hand of the lord wa on elijah; and he gird up hi
loin and ran befor ahab to the entranc of jezreel

19:1 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he
had slain all the prophet with the sword

19:2 then jezebel sent a messeng unto elijah say so let the
god do to me and more also if i make not thi life as the life of
one of them by to morrow about thi time

19:3 and when he saw that he aros and went for hi life and came
to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left hi servant there

19:4 but he himself went a day journey into the wilder and came
and sat down under a junip tree: and he request for himself that
he might die; and said it is enough; now o lord take away my life;
for i am not better than my father

19:5 and as he lay and slept under a junip tree behold then an
angel touch him and said unto him aris and eat

19:6 and he look and behold there wa a cake baken on the coal
and a cruse of water at hi head and he did eat and drink and laid

19:7 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touch
him and said aris and eat; becaus the journey is too great for
thee

19:8 and he aros and did eat and drink and went in the strength of
that meat forti day and forti night unto horeb the mount of god

19:9 and he came thither unto a cave and lodg there; and behold
the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest
thou here elijah? 19:10 and he said i have been veri jealou for
the lord god of hosts: for the children of israel have forsaken thi
coven thrown down thine altar and slain thi prophet with the
sword; and i even i onli am left; and they seek my life to take it
away

19:11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount befor the lord

and behold the lord pass by and a great and strong wind rent the
mountain and brake in piec the rock befor the lord; but the lord
wa not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the lord
wa not in the earthquake: 19:12 and after the earthquak a fire; but
the lord wa not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voic

19:13 and it wa so when elijah heard it that he wrap hi face in
hi mantl and went out and stood in the enter in of the cave
and behold there came a voic unto him and said what doest thou
here elijah? 19:14 and he said i have been veri jealou for the
lord god of hosts: becaus the children of israel have forsaken thi
coven thrown down thine altar and slain thi prophet with the
sword; and i even i onli am left; and they seek my life to take it
away

19:15 and the lord said unto him go return on thi way to the
wilder of damascus: and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king
over syria: 19:16 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
king over israel: and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt

19:17 and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of
hazael shall jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu
shall elisha slay

19:18 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knee which

19:20 and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i
pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee
and he said unto him go back again: for what have i done to thee?
19:21 and he return back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew
them and boil their flesh with the instrument of the oxen and
gave unto the peopl and they did eat then he aros and went after

will send my servant unto thee to morrow about thi time and they
shall search thine hous and the hous of thi servants; and it shall
be that whatsoev is pleasant in thine eye they shall put it in
their hand and take it away

20:7 then the king of israel call all the elder of the land and
said mark i pray you and see how thi man seeketh mischief: for he
sent unto me for my wive and for my children and for my silver and
for my gold; and i deni him not

20:8 and all the elder and all the peopl said unto him hearken not
unto him nor consent

20:9 wherefor he said unto the messeng of benhadad tell my lord
the king all that thou didst send for to thi servant at the first i
will do: but thi thing i may not do and the messeng depart and
brought him word again

20:10 and benhadad sent unto him and said the god do so unto me
and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffic for hand for
all the peopl that follow me

20:11 and the king of israel answer and said tell him let not him
that girdeth on hi har boast himself as he that putteth it off

20:12 and it came to pass when ben-hadad heard thi messag as he
wa drink he and the king in the pavilion that he said unto hi
servant set yourselv in array and they set themselv in array
against the citi

20:13 and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel
say thu saith the lord hast thou seen all thi great multitude?
behold i will deliv it into thine hand thi day; and thou shalt
know that i am the lord

20:14 and ahab said by whom? and he said thu saith the lord even
by the young men of the princ of the provinc then he said who
shall order the battle? and he answer thou

20:15 then he number the young men of the princ of the provinc
and they were two hundr and thirti two: and after them he number
all the peopl even all the children of israel be seven thousand

20:16 and they went out at noon but benhadad wa drink himself
drunk in the pavilion he and the king the thirti and two king
that help him

20:17 and the young men of the princ of the provinc went out
first; and benhadad sent out and they told him say there are men
come out of samaria

20:18 and he said whether they be come out for peac take them
alive; or whether they be come out for war take them aliv

20:19 so these young men of the princ of the provinc came out of
the citi and the armi which follow them

20:20 and they slew everi one hi man: and the syrian fled; and
israel pursu them: and benhadad the king of syria escap on an
hors with the horsemen

20:21 and the king of israel went out and smote the hors and
chariot and slew the syrian with a great slaughter

20:22 and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him
go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest: for at the
return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee

20:23 and the servant of the king of syria said unto him their god
are god of the hills; therefor they were stronger than we; but let
us fight against them in the plain and sure we shall be stronger
than they

20:24 and do thi thing take the king away everi man out of hi
place and put captain in their rooms: 20:25 and number thee an armi
like the armi that thou hast lost hors for hors and chariot for
chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain and sure we
shall be stronger than they and he hearken unto their voic and
did so

20:26 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad
number the syrian and went up to aphek to fight against israel

20:27 and the children of israel were number and were all present
and went against them: and the children of israel pitch befor them
like two littl flock of kids; but the syrian fill the countri

20:28 and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel
and said thu saith the lord becaus the syrian have said the lord
is god of the hill but he is not god of the valley therefor will
i deliv all thi great multitud into thine hand and ye shall know
that i am the lord

20:29 and they pitch one over against the other seven day and so
it wa that in the seventh day the battl wa joined: and the
children of israel slew of the syrian an hundr thousand footmen in
one day

20:30 but the rest fled to aphek into the city; and there a wall fell
upon twenti and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad
fled and came into the citi into an inner chamber

20:31 and hi servant said unto him behold now we have heard that
the king of the hous of israel are merci kings: let us i pray
thee put sackcloth on our loin and rope upon our head and go out
to the king of israel: peradventur he will save thi life

20:32 so they gird sackcloth on their loin and put rope on their
head and came to the king of israel and said thi servant benhadad
saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive? he is
my brother

20:33 now the men did dilig observ whether ani thing would come
from him and did hastili catch it: and they said thi brother
benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to
him; and he caus him to come up into the chariot

20:34 and ben-hadad said unto him the citi which my father took
from thi father i will restore; and thou shalt make street for thee
in damascu as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send
thee away with thi coven so he made a coven with him and sent
him away

20:35 and a certain man of the son of the prophet said unto hi
neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man
refus to smite him

20:36 then said he unto him becaus thou hast not obey the voic of
the lord behold as soon as thou art depart from me a lion shall
slay thee

and as soon as he wa depart from him a lion found him and slew
him

20:37 then he found anoth man and said smite me i pray thee and
the man smote him so that in smite he wound him

20:38 so the prophet depart and wait for the king by the way and
disguis himself with ash upon hi face

20:39 and as the king pass by he cri unto the king: and he said
thi servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold a man
turn asid and brought a man unto me and said keep thi man: if
by ani mean he be miss then shall thi life be for hi life or
els thou shalt pay a talent of silver

20:40 and as thi servant wa busi here and there he wa gone and the
king of israel said unto him so shall thi judgment be; thyself hast
decid it

20:41 and he hast and took the ash away from hi face; and the
king of israel discern him that he wa of the prophet

20:42 and he said unto him thu saith the lord becaus thou hast let
go out of thi hand a man whom i appoint to utter destruct
therefor thi life shall go for hi life and thi peopl for hi
peopl

20:43 and the king of israel went to hi hous heavi and displeas
and came to samaria

21:1 and it came to pass after these thing that naboth the
jezreelit had a vineyard which wa in jezreel hard by the palac of
ahab king of samaria

21:2 and ahab spake unto naboth say give me thi vineyard that i
may have it for a garden of herb becaus it is near unto my house:
and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or if it seem
good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money

21:3 and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should
give the inherit of my father unto thee

21:4 and ahab came into hi hous heavi and displeas becaus of the
word which naboth the jezreelit had spoken to him: for he had said i
will not give thee the inherit of my father and he laid him down
upon hi bed and turn away hi face and would eat no bread

21:5 but jezebel hi wife came to him and said unto him whi is thi
spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread? 21:6 and he said unto her
becaus i spake unto naboth the jezreelit and said unto him give me
thi vineyard for money; or els if it pleas thee i will give thee
anoth vineyard for it: and he answer i will not give thee my
vineyard

21:7 and jezebel hi wife said unto him dost thou now govern the
kingdom of israel? aris and eat bread and let thine heart be merry:
i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelit

21:8 so she wrote letter in ahab name and seal them with hi
seal and sent the letter unto the elder and to the nobl that were
in hi citi dwell with naboth

21:9 and she wrote in the letter say proclaim a fast and set
naboth on high among the people: 21:10 and set two men son of
belial befor him to bear wit against him say thou didst
blasphem god and the king and then carri him out and stone him
that he may die

21:11 and the men of hi citi even the elder and the nobl who were
the inhabit in hi citi did as jezebel had sent unto them and as
it wa written in the letter which she had sent unto them

21:12 they proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the peopl

21:13 and there came in two men children of belial and sat befor
him: and the men of belial wit against him even against naboth
in the presenc of the peopl say naboth did blasphem god and
the king then they carri him forth out of the citi and stone him
with stone that he die

21:14 then they sent to jezebel say naboth is stone and is
dead

21:15 and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth wa stone
and wa dead that jezebel said to ahab aris take possess of the
vineyard of naboth the jezreelit which he refus to give thee for
money: for naboth is not aliv but dead

21:16 and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth wa dead that
ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelit to
take possess of it

21:17 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbit say
21:18 aris go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria:
behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to
possess it

21:19 and thou shalt speak unto him say thu saith the lord hast
thou kill and also taken possession? and thou shalt speak unto him
say thu saith the lord in the place where dog lick the blood
of naboth shall dog lick thi blood even thine

21:20 and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy? and
he answer i have found thee: becaus thou hast sold thyself to work
evil in the sight of the lord

21:21 behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thi
poster and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the
wall and him that is shut up and left in israel 21:22 and will make
thine hous like the hous of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the
hous of baasha the son of ahijah for the provoc wherewith thou
hast provok me to anger and made israel to sin

21:23 and of jezebel also spake the lord say the dog shall eat
jezebel by the wall of jezreel

21:24 him that dieth of ahab in the citi the dog shall eat; and him
that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat

21:25 but there wa none like unto ahab which did sell himself to
work wicked in the sight of the lord whom jezebel hi wife
stir up

21:26 and he did veri abomin in follow idol accord to all
thing as did the amorit whom the lord cast out befor the children
of israel

21:27 and it came to pass when ahab heard those word that he rent
hi cloth and put sackcloth upon hi flesh and fast and lay in
sackcloth and went softli

21:28 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbit say
21:29 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself befor me? becaus he
humbleth himself befor me i will not bring the evil in hi days: but
in hi son day will i bring the evil upon hi hous

22:1 and they continu three year without war between syria and
israel

22:2 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king
of judah came down to the king of israel

22:3 and the king of israel said unto hi servant know ye that
ramoth in gilead is our and we be still and take it not out of the
hand of the king of syria? 22:4 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt
thou go with me to battl to ramothgilead? and jehoshaphat said to the
king of israel i am as thou art my peopl as thi peopl my hors
as thi hors

22:5 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquir i pray
thee at the word of the lord to day

22:6 then the king of israel gather the prophet togeth about
four hundr men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead
to battl or shall i forbear? and they said go up; for the lord
shall deliv it into the hand of the king

22:7 and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
besid that we might enquir of him? 22:8 and the king of israel
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah
by whom we may enquir of the lord: but i hate him; for he doth not
prophesi good concern me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not
the king say so

22:9 then the king of israel call an offic and said hasten
hither micaiah the son of imlah

22:10 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat
each on hi throne have put on their robe in a void place in the
entranc of the gate of samaria; and all the prophet prophesi
befor them

22:11 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horn of iron: and he
said thu saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrian
until thou have consum them

22:12 and all the prophet prophesi so say go up to
ramothgilead and prosper: for the lord shall deliv it into the
king hand

22:13 and the messeng that wa gone to call micaiah spake unto him
say behold now the word of the prophet declar good unto the
king with one mouth: let thi word i pray thee be like the word of
one of them and speak that which is good

22:14 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto
me that will i speak

22:15 so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah
shall we go against ramothgilead to battl or shall we forbear? and
he answer him go and prosper: for the lord shall deliv it into
the hand of the king

22:16 and the king said unto him how mani time shall i adjur thee
that thou tell me noth but that which is true in the name of the
lord? 22:17 and he said i saw all israel scatter upon the hill
as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the lord said these have no
master: let them return everi man to hi hous in peac

22:18 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell
thee that he would prophesi no good concern me but evil? 22:19
and he said hear thou therefor the word of the lord: i saw the lord
sit on hi throne and all the host of heaven stand by him on
hi right hand and on hi left

22:20 and the lord said who shall persuad ahab that he may go up
and fall at ramothgilead? and one said on thi manner and anoth
said on that manner

22:21 and there came forth a spirit and stood befor the lord and
said i will persuad him

22:22 and the lord said unto him wherewith? and he said i will go
forth and i will be a lie spirit in the mouth of all hi prophet
and he said thou shalt persud him and prevail also: go forth and
do so

22:23 now therefor behold the lord hath put a lie spirit in the
mouth of all these thi prophet and the lord hath spoken evil
concern thee

22:24 but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah
on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me
to speak unto thee? 22:25 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in
that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself

22:26 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carri him back
unto amon the governor of the citi and to joash the king son; 22:27
and say thu saith the king put thi fellow in the prison and feed
him with bread of afflict and with water of afflict until i
come in peac

22:28 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peac the lord hath
not spoken by me and he said hearken o peopl everi one of you

22:29 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up
to ramothgilead

22:30 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguis
myself and enter into the battle; but put thou on thi robe and the
king of israel disguis himself and went into the battl

22:31 but the king of syria command hi thirti and two captain that

22:32 and it came to pass when the captain of the chariot saw
jehoshaphat that they said sure it is the king of israel and they
turn asid to fight against him: and jehoshaphat cri out

22:33 and it came to pass when the captain of the chariot perceiv
that it wa not the king of israel that they turn back from
pursu him

22:34 and a certain man drew a bow at a ventur and smote the king of
israel between the joint of the harness: wherefor he said unto the
driver of hi chariot turn thine hand and carri me out of the host;
for i am wound

22:35 and the battl increas that day: and the king wa stay up in
hi chariot against the syrian and die at even: and the blood ran
out of the wound into the midst of the chariot

22:36 and there went a proclam throughout the host about the
go down of the sun say everi man to hi citi and everi man to
hi own countri

22:37 so the king die and wa brought to samaria; and they buri
the king in samaria

22:38 and one wash the chariot in the pool of samaria; and the dog
lick up hi blood; and they wash hi armour; accord unto the
word of the lord which he spake

22:39 now the rest of the act of ahab and all that he did and the
ivori hous which he made and all the citi that he built are they
not written in the book of the chronicl of the king of israel?
22:40 so ahab slept with hi fathers; and ahaziah hi son reign in
hi stead

22:41 and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the
fourth year of ahab king of israel

22:42 jehoshaphat wa thirti and five year old when he began to

22:47 there wa then no king in edom: a deputi wa king

22:48 jehoshaphat made ship of tharshish to go to ophir for gold: but
they went not; for the ship were broken at eziongeb

22:49 then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my
servant go with thi servant in the ship but jehoshaphat would not

22:50 and jehoshaphat slept with hi father and wa buri with hi

1:3 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbit aris go
up to meet the messeng of the king of samaria and say unto them
is it not becaus there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquir
of baalzebub the god of ekron? 1:4 now therefor thu saith the lord
thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but
shalt sure die and elijah depart

1:5 and when the messeng turn back unto him he said unto them
whi are ye now turn back? 1:6 and they said unto him there came a
man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that
sent you and say unto him thu saith the lord is it not becaus
there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquir of
baalzebub the god of ekron? therefor thou shalt not come down from

1:7 and he said unto them what manner of man wa he which came up to
meet you and told you these words? 1:8 and they answer him he wa
an hairi man and girt with a girdl of leather about hi loin and
he said it is elijah the tishbit

1:9 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifti with hi fifti and
he went up to him: and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he
spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down

1:10 and elijah answer and said to the captain of fifti if i be a

1:13 and he sent again a captain of the third fifti with hi fifti
and the third captain of fifti went up and came and fell on hi knee

1:14 behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two
captain of the former fifti with their fifties: therefor let my
life now be preciou in thi sight

1:15 and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him: be
not afraid of him and he aros and went down with him unto the king

1:16 and he said unto him thu saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast
sent messeng to enquir of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not
becaus there is no god in israel to enquir of hi word? therefor

1:17 so he die accord to the word of the lord which elijah had

and jehoram reign in hi stead in the second year of jehoram the son
of jehoshaphat king of judah; becaus he had no son

1:18 now the rest of the act of ahaziah which he did are they not

it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a
whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal

2:2 and elijah said unto elisha tarri here i pray thee; for the lord
hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth
and as thi soul liveth i will not leav thee so they went down to
bethel

2:3 and the son of the prophet that were at bethel came forth to
elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away
thi master from thi head to day? and he said yea i know it; hold ye
your peac

2:4 and elijah said unto him elisha tarri here i pray thee; for the
lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as
thi soul liveth i will not leav thee so they came to jericho

2:5 and the son of the prophet that were at jericho came to elisha
and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thi

soul liveth i will not leav thee and they two went on

2:7 and fifti men of the son of the prophet went and stood to view
afar off: and they two stood by jordan

2:8 and elijah took hi mantl and wrap it togeth and smote the
water and they were divid hither and thither so that they two
went over on dri ground

2:9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said
unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee befor i be taken away from
thee and elisha said i pray thee let a doubl portion of thi spirit
be upon me

2:10 and he said thou hast ask a hard thing: nevertheless if thou
see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee; but if
not it shall not be so

2:11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talk that
behold there appear a chariot of fire and hors of fire and
part them both asunder; and elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven

2:12 and elisha saw it and he cri my father my father the
chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more:
and he took hold of hi own cloth and rent them in two piec

2:13 he took up also the mantl of elijah that fell from him and went
back and stood by the bank of jordan; 2:14 and he took the mantl of
elijah that fell from him and smote the water and said where is
the lord god of elijah? and when he also had smitten the water they
part hither and thither: and elisha went over

2:15 and when the son of the prophet which were to view at jericho
saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they
came to meet him and bow themselv to the ground befor him

2:16 and they said unto him behold now there be with thi servant
fifti strong men; let them go we pray thee and seek thi master: lest
peradventur the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him
upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not
send

2:17 and when they urg him till he wa asham he said send they
sent therefor fifti men; and they sought three day but found him
not

2:18 and when they came again to him (for he tarri at jericho) he
said unto them did i not say unto you go not? 2:19 and the men of
the citi said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situat of thi
citi is pleasant as my lord seeth: but the water is naught and the
ground barren

2:20 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they
brought it to him

2:21 and he went forth unto the spring of the water and cast the
salt in there and said thu saith the lord i have heal these
waters; there shall not be from thenc ani more death or barren land

2:22 so the water were heal unto thi day accord to the say
of elisha which he spake

2:23 and he went up from thenc unto bethel: and as he wa go up by
the way there came forth littl children out of the citi and mock
him and said unto him go up thou bald head; go up thou bald head

2:24 and he turn back and look on them and curs them in the
name of the lord and there came forth two she bear out of the wood
and tare forti and two children of them

2:25 and he went from thenc to mount carmel and from thenc he

3:2 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord; but not like hi
father and like hi mother: for he put away the imag of baal that
hi father had made

3:3 nevertheless he cleav unto the sin of jeroboam the son of
nebat which made israel to sin; he depart not therefrom

3:4 and mesha king of moab wa a sheepmast and render unto the

3:7 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah say the
king of moab hath rebel against me: wilt thou go with me against
moab to battle? and he said i will go up: i am as thou art my peopl
as thi peopl and my hors as thi hors

3:8 and he said which way shall we go up? and he answer the way
through the wilder of edom

3:9 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of
edom: and they fetch a compass of seven day journey: and there wa
no water for the host and for the cattl that follow them

3:10 and the king of israel said alas! that the lord hath call
these three king togeth to deliv them into the hand of moab!
3:11 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
that we may enquir of the lord by him? and one of the king of
israel servant answer and said here is elisha the son of
shaphat which pour water on the hand of elijah

3:12 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the
king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him

3:13 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with
thee? get thee to the prophet of thi father and to the prophet of
thi mother

and the king of israel said unto him nay: for the lord hath call
these three king togeth to deliv them into the hand of moab

3:14 and elisha said as the lord of host liveth befor whom i
stand sure were it not that i regard the presenc of jehoshaphat
the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee

3:15 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the
minstrel play that the hand of the lord came upon him

3:16 and he said thu saith the lord make thi valley full of
ditch

3:17 for thu saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye
see rain; yet that valley shall be fill with water that ye may
drink both ye and your cattl and your beast

3:18 and thi is but a light thing in the sight of the lord: he will
deliv the moabit also into your hand

3:19 and ye shall smite everi fenc citi and everi choic citi and
shall fell everi good tree and stop all well of water and mar everi
good piec of land with stone

3:20 and it came to pass in the morn when the meat offer wa
offer that behold there came water by the way of edom and the
countri wa fill with water

3:21 and when all the moabit heard that the king were come up to
fight against them they gather all that were abl to put on armour
and upward and stood in the border

3:22 and they rose up earli in the morn and the sun shone upon the
water and the moabit saw the water on the other side as red as
blood: 3:23 and they said thi is blood: the king are sure slain
and they have smitten one another: now therefor moab to the spoil

3:24 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelit rose up
and smote the moabit so that they fled befor them: but they went
forward smite the moabit even in their countri

3:25 and they beat down the citi and on everi good piec of land
cast everi man hi stone and fill it; and they stop all the
well of water and fell all the good trees: onli in kirharaseth
left they the stone thereof; howbeit the slinger went about it and
smote it

3:26 and when the king of moab saw that the battl wa too sore for
him he took with him seven hundr men that drew sword to break
through even unto the king of edom: but they could not

3:27 then he took hi eldest son that should have reign in hi
stead and offer him for a burnt offer upon the wall and there
wa great indign against israel: and they depart from him and
return to their own land

4:1 now there cri a certain woman of the wive of the son of the
prophet unto elisha say thi servant my husband is dead; and thou
knowest that thi servant did fear the lord: and the creditor is come
to take unto him my two son to be bondmen

4:2 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee? tell me what
hast thou in the house? and she said thine handmaid hath not ani

4:3 then he said go borrow thee vessel abroad of all thi
neighbour even empti vessels; borrow not a few

4:4 and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
upon thi son and shalt pour out into all those vessel and thou
shalt set asid that which is full

son who brought the vessel to her; and she pour out

4:6 and it came to pass when the vessel were full that she said
unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is
not a vessel more and the oil stay

4:7 then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the

4:8 and it fell on a day that elisha pass to shunem where wa a
great woman; and she constrain him to eat bread and so it wa that

4:9 and she said unto her husband behold now i perceiv that thi is

4:11 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turn into

4:12 and he said to gehazi hi servant call thi shunammit and when
he had call her she stood befor him

4:13 and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been

4:17 and the woman conceiv and bare a son at that season that

4:18 and when the child wa grown it fell on a day that he went out
to hi father to the reaper

4:19 and he said unto hi father my head my head and he said to a
lad carri him to hi mother

4:20 and when he had taken him and brought him to hi mother he sat

4:23 and he said wherefor wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither
new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well

4:24 then she saddl an ass and said to her servant drive and go
forward; slack not thi ride for me except i bid thee

4:25 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it
came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to
gehazi hi servant behold yonder is that shunammite: 4:26 run now i
pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee? is it

caught him by the feet: but gehazi came near to thrust her away and
the man of god said let her alone; for her soul is vex within her:
and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me

4:28 then she said did i desir a son of my lord? did i not say do

take my staff in thine hand and go thi way: if thou meet ani man

4:30 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thi

4:31 and gehazi pass on befor them and laid the staff upon the
face of the child; but there wa neither voic nor hear wherefor

4:32 and when elisha wa come into the hous behold the child wa

4:33 he went in therefor and shut the door upon them twain and

4:34 and he went up and lay upon the child and put hi mouth upon

and stretch himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child wax

and the child open hi eye

4:36 and he call gehazi and said call thi shunammit so he

4:43 and hi servitor said what should i set thi befor an hundr
men? he said again give the peopl that they may eat: for thu
saith the lord they shall eat and shall leav thereof

4:44 so he set it befor them and they did eat and left thereof
accord to the word of the lord

5:1 now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria wa a great
man with hi master and honour becaus by him the lord had given
deliver unto syria: he wa also a mighti man in valour but he wa
a leper

5:2 and the syrian had gone out by compani and had brought away
captiv out of the land of israel a littl maid; and she wait on

5:3 and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the
prophet that is in samaria! for he would recov him of hi leprosi

5:4 and one went in and told hi lord say thu and thu said the

raiment

5:6 and he brought the letter to the king of israel say now when

5:7 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter
that he rent hi cloth and said am i god to kill and to make
aliv that thi man doth send unto me to recov a man of hi
leprosy? wherefor consid i pray you and see how he seeketh a

5:8 and it wa so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king
of israel had rent hi cloth that he sent to the king say
wherefor hast thou rent thi clothes? let him come now to me and he
shall know that there is a prophet in israel

5:9 so naaman came with hi hors and with hi chariot and stood at
the door of the hous of elisha

5:10 and elisha sent a messeng unto him say go and wash in
jordan seven time and thi flesh shall come again to thee and thou
shalt be clean

5:11 but naaman wa wroth and went away and said behold i thought
he will sure come out to me and stand and call on the name of the
lord hi god and strike hi hand over the place and recov the
leper

5:12 are not abana and pharpar river of damascu better than all

turn and went away in a rage

5:13 and hi servant came near and spake unto him and said my
father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou
not have done it? how much rather then when he saith to thee wash
and be clean? 5:14 then went he down and dip himself seven time

henceforth offer neither burnt offer nor sacrific unto other god
but unto the lord

5:18 in thi thing the lord pardon thi servant that when my master
goeth into the hous of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my
hand and i bow myself in the hous of rimmon: when i bow down myself
in the hous of rimmon the lord pardon thi servant in thi thing

5:19 and he said unto him go in peac so he depart from him a

5:20 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold
my master hath spare naaman thi syrian in not receiv at hi
hand that which he brought: but as the lord liveth i will run after
him and take somewhat of him

5:21 so gehazi follow after naaman and when naaman saw him run
after him he light down from the chariot to meet him and said is

5:24 and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and
bestow them in the house: and he let the men go and they depart

5:25 but he went in and stood befor hi master and elisha said unto
him whenc comest thou gehazi? and he said thi servant went no

5:26 and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man

money and to receiv garment and oliveyard and vineyard and
sheep and oxen and menserv and maidservants? 5:27 the leprosi
therefor of naaman shall cleav unto thee and unto thi seed for
ever and he went out from hi presenc a leper as white as snow

6:1 and the son of the prophet said unto elisha behold now the
place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us

6:2 let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thenc everi man a
beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he

and he cri and said ala master! for it wa borrow

6:6 and the man of god said where fell it? and he shew him the
place

and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither; and the iron did
swim

6:7 therefor said he take it up to thee and he put out hi hand
and took it

6:8 then the king of syria war against israel and took counsel
with hi servant say in such and such a place shall be my camp

6:9 and the man of god sent unto the king of israel say bewar
that thou pass not such a place; for thither the syrian are come

6:10 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god
told him and warn him of and save himself there not onc nor

6:11 therefor the heart of the king of syria wa sore troubl for
thi thing; and he call hi servant and said unto them will ye
not shew me which of us is for the king of israel? 6:12 and one of
hi servant said none my lord o king: but elisha the prophet that

6:13 and he said go and spi where he is that i may send and fetch

6:17 and elisha pray and said lord i pray thee open hi eye
that he may see and the lord open the eye of the young man; and he
saw: and behold the mountain wa full of hors and chariot of fire
round about elisha

6:18 and when they came down to him elisha pray unto the lord and
said smite thi peopl i pray thee with blind and he smote
them with blind accord to the word of elisha

6:19 and elisha said unto them thi is not the way neither is thi

he led them to samaria

6:20 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that
elisha said lord open the eye of these men that they may see and
the lord open their eye and they saw; and behold they were in
the midst of samaria

6:21 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my
father shall i smite them? shall i smite them? 6:22 and he answer
thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast
taken captiv with thi sword and with thi bow? set bread and water
befor them that they may eat and drink and go to their master

6:23 and he prepar great provis for them: and when they had eaten
and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the
band of syria came no more into the land of israel

6:24 and it came to pass after thi that benhadad king of syria

6:27 and he said if the lord do not help thee whenc shall i help
thee? out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress? 6:28 and the
king said unto her what aileth thee? and she answer thi woman

eat my son to morrow

6:29 so we boil my son and did eat him: and i said unto her on the

6:30 and it came to pass when the king heard the word of the woman
that he rent hi clothes; and he pass by upon the wall and the
peopl look and behold he had sackcloth within upon hi flesh

6:31 then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of
elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him thi day

6:32 but elisha sat in hi hous and the elder sat with him; and the
king sent a man from befor him: but ere the messeng came to him he
said to the elder see ye how thi son of a murder hath sent to
take away mine head? look when the messeng cometh shut the door
and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of hi master feet
behind him? 6:33 and while he yet talk with them behold the
messeng came down unto him: and he said behold thi evil is of the
lord; what should i wait for the lord ani longer? 7:1 then elisha
said hear ye the word of the lord; thu saith the lord to morrow

7:2 then a lord on whose hand the king lean answer the man of god

thing be? and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eye but
shalt not eat thereof

7:3 and there were four leprou men at the enter in of the gate:
and they said one to anoth whi sit we here until we die? 7:4 if we
say we will enter into the citi then the famin is in the citi and
we shall die there: and if we sit still here we die also now
therefor come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians: if they
save us aliv we shall live; and if they kill us we shall but die

7:5 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the
syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of
syria behold there wa no man there

7:6 for the lord had made the host of the syrian to hear a nois of
chariot and a nois of hors even the nois of a great host: and
they said one to anoth lo the king of israel hath hire against us
the king of the hittit and the king of the egyptian to come

7:7 wherefor they aros and fled in the twilight and left their

the sight of the lord as did the hous of ahab: for he wa the son in
law of the hous of ahab

8:28 and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael
king of syria in ramothgilead; and the syrian wound joram

8:29 and king joram went back to be heal in jezreel of the wound
which the syrian had given him at ramah when he fought against
hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah
went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel becaus he wa
sick

9:1 and elisha the prophet call one of the children of the prophet
and said unto him gird up thi loin and take thi box of oil in
thine hand and go to ramothgilead: 9:2 and when thou comest thither
look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go
in and make him aris up from among hi brethren and carri him to an
inner chamber; 9:3 then take the box of oil and pour it on hi head
and say thu saith the lord i have anoint thee king over israel
then open the door and flee and tarri not

9:4 so the young man even the young man the prophet went to
ramothgilead

9:5 and when he came behold the captain of the host were sitting;
and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto
which of all us? and he said to thee o captain

9:6 and he aros and went into the house; and he pour the oil on

anoint thee king over the peopl of the lord even over israel

9:7 and thou shalt smite the hous of ahab thi master that i may
aveng the blood of my servant the prophet and the blood of all the
servant of the lord at the hand of jezebel

9:8 for the whole hous of ahab shall perish: and i will cut off from
ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and
left in israel: 9:9 and i will make the hous of ahab like the hous
of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the hous of baasha the son of
ahijah: 9:10 and the dog shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel
and there shall be none to buri her and he open the door and fled

9:11 then jehu came forth to the servant of hi lord: and one said
unto him is all well? wherefor came thi mad fellow to thee? and he
said unto them ye know the man and hi commun

9:12 and they said it is false; tell us now and he said thu and
thu spake he to me say thu saith the lord i have anoint thee
king over israel

9:13 then they hast and took everi man hi garment and put it
under him on the top of the stair and blew with trumpet say
jehu is king

9:14 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspir
against joram (now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel
becaus of hazael king of syria

9:15 but king joram wa return to be heal in jezreel of the wound
which the syrian had given him when he fought with hazael king of
syria) and jehu said if it be your mind then let none go forth
nor escap out of the citi to go to tell it in jezreel

9:16 so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel; for joram lay
there

and ahaziah king of judah wa come down to see joram

9:17 and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spi
the compani of jehu as he came and said i see a compani and joram
said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it

thu saith the king is it peace? and jehu said what hast thou to do
with peace? turn thee behind me and the watchman told say the
messeng came to them but he cometh not again

9:19 then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and
said thu saith the king is it peace? and jehu answer what hast
thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me

9:20 and the watchman told say he came even unto them and cometh
not again: and the drive is like the drive of jehu the son of
nimshi; for he driveth furious

9:21 and joram said make readi and hi chariot wa made readi and
joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in hi
chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of
naboth the jezreelit

9:22 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it
peac jehu? and he answer what peac so long as the whoredom of
thi mother jezebel and her witchcraft are so many? 9:23 and joram
turn hi hand and fled and said to ahaziah there is treacheri o
ahaziah

9:24 and jehu drew a bow with hi full strength and smote jehoram
between hi arm and the arrow went out at hi heart and he sunk
down in hi chariot

9:25 then said jehu to bidkar hi captain take up and cast him in
the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite: for rememb how
that when i and thou rode togeth after ahab hi father the lord
laid thi burden upon him; 9:26 sure i have seen yesterday the blood
of naboth and the blood of hi son saith the lord; and i will
requit thee in thi plat saith the lord now therefor take and cast

9:27 but when ahaziah the king of judah saw thi he fled by the way
of the garden hous and jehu follow after him and said smite him

by ibleam

and he fled to megiddo and die there

9:28 and hi servant carri him in a chariot to jerusalem and
buri him in hi sepulchr with hi father in the citi of david

9:29 and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah

9:30 and when jehu wa come to jezreel jezebel heard of it; and she
paint her face and tire her head and look out at a window

9:31 and as jehu enter in at the gate she said had zimri peac
who slew hi master? 9:32 and he lift up hi face to the window

her blood wa sprinkl on the wall and on the horses: and he trode
her under foot

9:34 and when he wa come in he did eat and drink and said go see
now thi curs woman and buri her: for she is a king daughter

9:35 and they went to buri her: but they found no more of her than the
skull and the feet and the palm of her hand

9:36 wherefor they came again and told him and he said thi is the
word of the lord which he spake by hi servant elijah the tishbit
say in the portion of jezreel shall dog eat the flesh of jezebel:
9:37 and the carcas of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of jezreel; so that they shall not say thi is

10:1 and ahab had seventi son in samaria and jehu wrote letter and
sent to samaria unto the ruler of jezreel to the elder and to
them that brought up ahab children say 10:2 now as soon as thi
letter cometh to you see your master son are with you and

10:4 but they were exceedingli afraid and said behold two king

over the hous and he that wa over the citi the elder also and
the bringer up of the children sent to jehu say we are thi
servant and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make ani
king: do thou that which is good in thine eye

10:6 then he wrote a letter the second time to them say if ye be

men your master son and come to me to jezreel by to morrow thi
time now the king son be seventi person were with the great

now that there shall fall unto the earth noth of the word of the
lord which the lord spake concern the hous of ahab: for the lord
hath done that which he spake by hi servant elijah

10:11 so jehu slew all that remain of the hous of ahab in jezreel
and all hi great men and hi kinsfolk and hi priest until he

10:12 and he aros and depart and came to samaria and as he wa at

10:20 and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembl for baal and they

execut that which is right in mine eye and hast done unto the
hous of ahab accord to all that wa in mine heart thi children of
the fourth gener shall sit on the throne of israel

10:31 but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of
israel with all hi heart: for he depart not from the sin of
jeroboam which made israel to sin

10:32 in those day the lord began to cut israel short: and hazael
smote them in all the coast of israel; 10:33 from jordan eastward

11:8 and ye shall compass the king round about everi man with hi
weapon in hi hand: and he that cometh within the rang let him be
slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in

11:9 and the captain over the hundr did accord to all thing

that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on
the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest

11:10 and to the captain over hundr did the priest give king

jeroboam who made israel sin but walk therein: and there remain

13:14 now elisha wa fallen sick of hi sick whereof he die and
joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over hi face
and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the

13:15 and elisha said unto him take bow and arrow and he took unto

13:16 and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow
and he put hi hand upon it: and elisha put hi hand upon the king
hand

13:17 and he said open the window eastward and he open it then
elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lord

13:19 and the man of god wa wroth with him and said thou shouldest

14:11 but amaziah would not hear therefor jehoash king of israel

15:37 in those day the lord began to send against judah rezin the

16:6 at that time rezin king of syria recov elath to syria and

16:7 so ahaz sent messeng to tiglathpiles king of assyria
say i am thi servant and thi son: come up and save me out of the
hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel
which rise up against me

16:8 and ahaz took the silver and gold that wa found in the hous of

the brasen altar shall be for me to enquir by

16:16 thu did urijah the priest accord to all that king ahaz

16:17 and king ahaz cut off the border of the base and remov the
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stone

16:18 and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the hous
and the king entri without turn he from the hous of the lord for
the king of assyria

16:19 now the rest of the act of ahaz which he did are they not
written in the book of the chronicl of the king of judah? 16:20
and ahaz slept with hi father and wa buri with hi father in
the citi of david: and hezekiah hi son reign in hi stead

17:1 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of
elah to reign in samaria over israel nine year

17:2 and he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord but not
as the king of israel that were befor him

17:3 against him came up shalmanes king of assyria; and hoshea
becam hi servant and gave him present

17:4 and the king of assyria found conspiraci in hoshea: for he had
sent messeng to so king of egypt and brought no present to the
king of assyria as he had done year by year: therefor the king of
assyria shut him up and bound him in prison

17:5 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and
went up to samaria and besieg it three year

17:6 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and
carri israel away into assyria and place them in halah and in
habor by the river of gozan and in the citi of the mede

17:7 for so it wa that the children of israel had sin against the
lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt
from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had fear other
god 17:8 and walk in the statut of the heathen whom the lord
cast out from befor the children of israel and of the king of
israel which they had made

17:9 and the children of israel did secretli those thing that were
not right against the lord their god and they built them high place
in all their citi from the tower of the watchmen to the fenc
citi

17:10 and they set them up imag and grove in everi high hill and
under everi green tree: 17:11 and there they burnt incens in all the
high place as did the heathen whom the lord carri away befor
them; and wrought wick thing to provok the lord to anger: 17:12
for they serv idol whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall
not do thi thing

17:13 yet the lord testifi against israel and against judah by all
the prophet and by all the seer say turn ye from your evil
way and keep my command and my statut accord to all the
law which i command your father and which i sent to you by my
servant the prophet

17:14 notwithstand they would not hear but harden their neck
like to the neck of their father that did not believ in the lord
their god

17:15 and they reject hi statut and hi coven that he made
with their father and hi testimoni which he testifi against
them; and they follow vaniti and becam vain and went after the
heathen that were round about them concern whom the lord had
charg them that they should not do like them

17:16 and they left all the command of the lord their god and
made them molten imag even two calv and made a grove and
worship all the host of heaven and serv baal

17:17 and they caus their son and their daughter to pass through
the fire and use divin and enchant and sold themselv to
do evil in the sight of the lord to provok him to anger

17:18 therefor the lord wa veri angri with israel and remov them
out of hi sight: there wa none left but the tribe of judah onli

17:19 also judah kept not the command of the lord their god but
walk in the statut of israel which they made

17:20 and the lord reject all the seed of israel and afflict
them and deliv them into the hand of spoiler until he had cast
them out of hi sight

17:21 for he rent israel from the hous of david; and they made
jeroboam the son of nebat king: and jeroboam drave israel from
follow the lord and made them sin a great sin

17:22 for the children of israel walk in all the sin of jeroboam
which he did; they depart not from them; 17:23 until the lord
remov israel out of hi sight as he had said by all hi servant
the prophet so wa israel carri away out of their own land to
assyria unto thi day

17:24 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from
cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and place
them in the citi of samaria instead of the children of israel: and
they possess samaria and dwelt in the citi thereof

17:25 and so it wa at the begin of their dwell there that
they fear not the lord: therefor the lord sent lion among them
which slew some of them

17:26 wherefor they spake to the king of assyria say the nation
which thou hast remov and place in the citi of samaria know not
the manner of the god of the land: therefor he hath sent lion among
them and behold they slay them becaus they know not the manner of
the god of the land

17:27 then the king of assyria command say carri thither one of
the priest whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell
there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land

17:28 then one of the priest whom they had carri away from samaria
came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the
lord

17:29 howbeit everi nation made god of their own and put them in the
hous of the high place which the samaritan had made everi nation
in their citi wherein they dwelt

17:30 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth
made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima 17:31 and the avit
made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvit burnt their children in
fire to adrammelech and anammelech the god of sepharvaim

17:32 so they fear the lord and made unto themselv of the lowest
of them priest of the high place which sacrif for them in the
hous of the high place

17:33 they fear the lord and serv their own god after the
manner of the nation whom they carri away from thenc

17:34 unto thi day they do after the former manners: they fear not
the lord neither do they after their statut or after their
ordin or after the law and command which the lord command
the children of jacob whom he name israel; 17:35 with whom the lord
had made a coven and charg them say ye shall not fear other
god nor bow yourselv to them nor serv them nor sacrific to
them: 17:36 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt
with great power and a stretch out arm him shall ye fear and him
shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrific

17:37 and the statut and the ordin and the law and the
command which he wrote for you ye shall observ to do for
evermore; and ye shall not fear other god

17:38 and the coven that i have made with you ye shall not forget;
neither shall ye fear other god

17:39 but the lord your god ye shall fear; and he shall deliv you
out of the hand of all your enemi

17:40 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former
manner

17:41 so these nation fear the lord and serv their graven
imag both their children and their children children: as did
their father so do they unto thi day

18:1 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king
of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign

18:2 twenti and five year old wa he when he began to reign; and he
reign twenti and nine year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa
abi the daughter of zachariah

18:3 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord
accord to all that david hi father did

18:4 he remov the high place and brake the imag and cut down
the grove and brake in piec the brasen serpent that mose had
made: for unto those day the children of israel did burn incens to
it: and he call it nehushtan

18:5 he trust in the lord god of israel; so that after him wa none
like him among all the king of judah nor ani that were befor him

18:6 for he clave to the lord and depart not from follow him
but kept hi command which the lord command mose

18:7 and the lord wa with him; and he prosper whithersoev he went
forth: and he rebel against the king of assyria and serv him
not

18:8 he smote the philistin even unto gaza and the border
thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenc citi

18:9 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which
wa the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that
shalmanes king of assyria came up against samaria and besieg it

18:10 and at the end of three year they took it: even in the sixth
year of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel
samaria wa taken

18:11 and the king of assyria did carri away israel unto assyria and
put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the
citi of the medes: 18:12 becaus they obey not the voic of the
lord their god but transgress hi coven and all that mose the
servant of the lord command and would not hear them nor do them

18:13 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king
of assyria come up against all the fenc citi of judah and took
them

18:14 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to
lachish say i have offended; return from me: that which thou
puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appoint unto
hezekiah king of judah three hundr talent of silver and thirti
talent of gold

18:15 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that wa found in the hous
of the lord and in the treasur of the king hous

18:16 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the door of the
templ of the lord and from the pillar which hezekiah king of judah
had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria

18:17 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsari and rabshakeh
from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and
they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the
highway of the fuller field

18:18 and when they had call to the king there came out to them
eliakim the son of hilkiah which wa over the household and shebna
the scribe and joah the son of asaph the record

18:19 and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thu
saith the great king the king of assyria what confid is thi
wherein thou trustest? 18:20 thou sayest (but they are but vain
words) i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou
trust that thou rebellest against me? 18:21 now behold thou
trustest upon the staff of thi bruis reed even upon egypt on
which if a man lean it will go into hi hand and pierc it: so is
pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him

18:22 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god: is not that
he whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away and
hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship befor thi altar
in jerusalem? 18:23 now therefor i pray thee give pledg to my
lord the king of assyria and i will deliv thee two thousand hors
if thou be abl on thi part to set rider upon them

18:24 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my master servant and put thi trust on egypt for chariot
and for horsemen? 18:25 am i now come up without the lord against
thi place to destroy it? the lord said to me go up against thi
land and destroy it

18:26 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto
rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thi servant in the syrian language;
for we understand it: and talk not with us in the jew languag in
the ear of the peopl that are on the wall

18:27 but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thi
master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the
men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink
their own piss with you? 18:28 then rabshakeh stood and cri with a
loud voic in the jew languag and spake say hear the word of
the great king the king of assyria: 18:29 thu saith the king let
not hezekiah deceiv you: for he shall not be abl to deliv you out
of hi hand: 18:30 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord
say the lord will sure deliv us and thi citi shall not be
deliv into the hand of the king of assyria

18:31 hearken not to hezekiah: for thu saith the king of assyria
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then
eat ye everi man of hi own vine and everi one of hi fig tree and
drink ye everi one the water of hi cistern: 18:32 until i come and
take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a
land of bread and vineyard a land of oil oliv and of honey that ye
may live and not die: and hearken not unto hezekiah when he
persuadeth you say the lord will deliv us

18:33 hath ani of the god of the nation deliv at all hi land
out of the hand of the king of assyria? 18:34 where are the god of
hamath and of arpad? where are the god of sepharvaim hena and
ivah? have they deliv samaria out of mine hand? 18:35 who are
they among all the god of the countri that have deliv their
countri out of mine hand that the lord should deliv jerusalem out
of mine hand? 18:36 but the peopl held their peac and answer him
not a word: for the king command wa say answer him not

18:37 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which wa over the
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the
record to hezekiah with their cloth rent and told him the word
of rabshakeh

19:1 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent
hi cloth and cover himself with sackcloth and went into the
hous of the lord

19:2 and he sent eliakim which wa over the household and shebna the
scribe and the elder of the priest cover with sackcloth to
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz

19:3 and they said unto him thu saith hezekiah thi day is a day of
troubl and of rebuk and blasphemy; for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth

19:4 it may be the lord thi god will hear all the word of rabshakeh
whom the king of assyria hi master hath sent to reproach the live
god; and will reprov the word which the lord thi god hath heard:
wherefor lift up thi prayer for the remnant that are left

19:5 so the servant of king hezekiah came to isaiah

19:6 and isaiah said unto them thu shall ye say to your master thu
saith the lord be not afraid of the word which thou hast heard with
which the servant of the king of assyria have blasphem me

19:7 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and shall return to hi own land; and i will caus him to fall by the
sword in hi own land

19:8 so rabshakeh return and found the king of assyria war
against libnah: for he had heard that he wa depart from lachish

19:9 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is
come out to fight against thee: he sent messeng again unto
hezekiah say 19:10 thu shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah
say let not thi god in whom thou trustest deceiv thee say
jerusalem shall not be deliv into the hand of the king of assyria

19:11 behold thou hast heard what the king of assyria have done to
all land by destroy them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
19:12 have the god of the nation deliv them which my father
have destroyed; as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of
eden which were in thelasar? 19:13 where is the king of hamath and
the king of arpad and the king of the citi of sepharvaim of hena
and ivah? 19:14 and hezekiah receiv the letter of the hand of the
messeng and read it: and hezekiah went up into the hous of the
lord and spread it befor the lord

19:15 and hezekiah pray befor the lord and said o lord god of
israel which dwellest between the cherubim thou art the god even
thou alon of all the kingdom of the earth; thou hast made heaven
and earth

19:16 lord bow down thine ear and hear: open lord thine eye and
see: and hear the word of sennacherib which hath sent him to
reproach the live god

19:17 of a truth lord the king of assyria have destroy the
nation and their land 19:18 and have cast their god into the fire:
for they were no god but the work of men hand wood and stone:
therefor they have destroy them

19:19 now therefor o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out
of hi hand that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art
the lord god even thou onli

19:20 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah say thu saith
the lord god of israel that which thou hast pray to me against
sennacherib king of assyria i have heard

19:21 thi is the word that the lord hath spoken concern him; the
virgin the daughter of zion hath despis thee and laugh thee to
scorn; the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee

19:22 whom hast thou reproach and blasphemed? and against whom hast
thou exalt thi voic and lift up thine eye on high? even against
the holi one of israel

19:23 by thi messeng thou hast reproach the lord and hast said
with the multitud of my chariot i am come up to the height of the
mountain to the side of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar
tree thereof and the choic fir tree thereof: and i will enter into
the lodg of hi border and into the forest of hi carmel

19:24 i have dig and drunk strang water and with the sole of my
feet have i dri up all the river of besieg place

19:25 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient
time that i have form it? now have i brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay wast fenc citi into ruinou heap

19:26 therefor their inhabit were of small power they were
dismay and confounded; they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the hous top and as corn blast
befor it be grown up

19:27 but i know thi abod and thi go out and thi come in and
thi rage against me

19:28 becaus thi rage against me and thi tumult is come up into mine
ear therefor i will put my hook in thi nose and my bridl in thi
lip and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest

19:29 and thi shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat thi year such
thing as grow of themselv and in the second year that which
springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye and reap and
plant vineyard and eat the fruit thereof

19:30 and the remnant that is escap of the hous of judah shall yet
again take root downward and bear fruit upward

19:31 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that

19:34 for i will defend thi citi to save it for mine own sake and

19:36 so sennacherib king of assyria depart and went and return

20:1 in those day wa hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet

20:2 then he turn hi face to the wall and pray unto the lord

and tell hezekiah the captain of my peopl thu saith the lord the
god of david thi father i have heard thi prayer i have seen thi

20:6 and i will add unto thi day fifteen years; and i will deliv
thee and thi citi out of the hand of the king of assyria; and i will

20:7 and isaiah said take a lump of fig and they took and laid it

20:8 and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the
lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the hous of the lord

lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
shadow go forward ten degre or go back ten degrees? 20:10 and
hezekiah answer it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten
degrees: nay but let the shadow return backward ten degre

20:11 and isaiah the prophet cri unto the lord: and he brought the
shadow ten degre backward by which it had gone down in the dial of
ahaz

20:12 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of

20:13 and hezekiah hearken unto them and shew them all the hous
of hi preciou thing the silver and the gold and the spice and

20:15 and he said what have they seen in thine house? and hezekiah
answer all the thing that are in mine hous have they seen: there
is noth among my treasur that i have not shew them

20:16 and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord

carri into babylon: noth shall be left saith the lord

20:18 and of thi son that shall issu from thee which thou shalt
beget shall they take away; and they shall be eunuch in the palac
of the king of babylon

20:19 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord
which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peac and
truth be in my days? 20:20 and the rest of the act of hezekiah and
all hi might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought
water into the citi are they not written in the book of the
chronicl of the king of judah? 20:21 and hezekiah slept with hi

21:4 and he built altar in the hous of the lord of which the lord

21:7 and he set a graven imag of the grove that he had made in the
hous of which the lord said to david and to solomon hi son in
thi hous and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribe of
israel will i put my name for ever: 21:8 neither will i make the feet
of israel move ani more out of the land which i gave their fathers;
onli if they will observ to do accord to all that i have command
them and accord to all the law that my servant mose command
them

21:9 but they hearken not: and manasseh seduc them to do more evil
than did the nation whom the lord destroy befor the children of
israel

21:10 and the lord spake by hi servant the prophet say 21:11
becaus manasseh king of judah hath done these abomin and hath
done wickedli abov all that the amorit did which were befor him
and hath made judah also to sin with hi idols: 21:12 therefor thu
saith the lord god of israel behold i am bring such evil upon
jerusalem and judah that whosoev heareth of it both hi ear shall
tingl

21:13 and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the
plummet of the hous of ahab: and i will wipe jerusalem as a man
wipeth a dish wipe it and turn it upsid down

21:14 and i will forsak the remnant of mine inherit and deliv
them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall becom a prey and
a spoil to all their enemies; 21:15 becaus they have done that which

21:16 moreov manasseh shed innoc blood veri much till he had

21:23 and the servant of amon conspir against him and slew the
king in hi own hous

21:24 and the peopl of the land slew all them that had conspir

22:14 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and

of tikvah the son of harha keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt
in jerusalem in the college;) and they commun with her

22:18 but to the king of judah which sent you to enquir of the lord

land of egypt i chose no citi among all the tribe of israel to build
an hous in that my name might be there; neither chose i ani man to
be a ruler over my peopl israel: 6:6 but i have chosen jerusalem
that my name might be there; and have chosen david to be over my
peopl israel

6:7 now it wa in the heart of david my father to build an hous for
the name of the lord god of israel

6:8 but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it wa in thine
heart to build an hous for my name thou didst well in that it wa in
thine heart: 6:9 notwithstand thou shalt not build the house; but
thi son which shall come forth out of thi loin he shall build the
hous for my name

6:10 the lord therefor hath perform hi word that he hath spoken:
for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the
throne of israel as the lord promis and have built the hous for
the name of the lord god of israel

6:11 and in it have i put the ark wherein is the coven of the
lord that he made with the children of israel

6:12 and he stood befor the altar of the lord in the presenc of all
the congreg of israel and spread forth hi hands: 6:13 for
solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubit long and five
cubit broad and three cubit high and had set it in the midst of
the court: and upon it he stood and kneel down upon hi knee
befor all the congreg of israel and spread forth hi hand
toward heaven

6:14 and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the
heaven nor in the earth; which keepest coven and shewest merci
unto thi servant that walk befor thee with all their hearts: 6:15
thou which hast kept with thi servant david my father that which thou
hast promis him; and spakest with thi mouth and hast fulfil it
with thine hand as it is thi day

6:16 now therefor o lord god of israel keep with thi servant david
my father that which thou hast promis him say there shall not
fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel; yet so
that thi children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou
hast walk befor me

6:17 now then o lord god of israel let thi word be verifi which
thou hast spoken unto thi servant david

6:18 but will god in veri deed dwell with men on the earth? behold
heaven and the heaven of heaven cannot contain thee; how much less
thi hous which i have built! 6:19 have respect therefor to the
prayer of thi servant and to hi supplic o lord my god to
hearken unto the cri and the prayer which thi servant prayeth befor
thee: 6:20 that thine eye may be open upon thi hous day and night
upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thi name
there; to hearken unto the prayer which thi servant prayeth toward
thi place

6:21 hearken therefor unto the supplic of thi servant and of
thi peopl israel which they shall make toward thi place: hear thou
from thi dwell place even from heaven; and when thou hearest
forgiv

6:22 if a man sin against hi neighbour and an oath be laid upon him
to make him swear and the oath come befor thine altar in thi house;
6:23 then hear thou from heaven and do and judg thi servant by
requit the wick by recompens hi way upon hi own head; and
by justifi the righteou by give him accord to hi

6:24 and if thi peopl israel be put to the wors befor the enemi
becaus they have sin against thee; and shall return and confess
thi name and pray and make supplic befor thee in thi house;
6:25 then hear thou from the heaven and forgiv the sin of thi
peopl israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to
them and to their father

6:26 when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain becaus they
have sin against thee; yet if they pray toward thi place and
confess thi name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict
them; 6:27 then hear thou from heaven and forgiv the sin of thi
servant and of thi peopl israel when thou hast taught them the
good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thi land which
thou hast given unto thi peopl for an inherit

6:28 if there be dearth in the land if there be pestil if there
be blast or mildew locust or caterpillers; if their enemi
besieg them in the citi of their land; whatsoev sore or
whatsoev sick there be: 6:29 then what prayer or what
supplic soever shall be made of ani man or of all thi peopl
israel when everi one shall know hi own sore and hi own grief and
shall spread forth hi hand in thi house: 6:30 then hear thou from
heaven thi dwell place and forgiv and render unto everi man
accord unto all hi way whose heart thou knowest; (for thou onli
knowest the heart of the children of men:) 6:31 that they may fear
thee to walk in thi way so long as they live in the land which thou
gavest unto our father

6:32 moreov concern the stranger which is not of thi peopl
israel but is come from a far countri for thi great name sake and
thi mighti hand and thi stretch out arm; if they come and pray in
thi house; 6:33 then hear thou from the heaven even from thi
dwell place and do accord to all that the stranger calleth to
thee for; that all peopl of the earth may know thi name and fear
thee as doth thi peopl israel and may know that thi hous which i
have built is call by thi name

6:34 if thi peopl go out to war against their enemi by the way that
thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward thi citi which
thou hast chosen and the hous which i have built for thi name; 6:35
then hear thou from the heaven their prayer and their supplic
and maintain their caus

6:36 if they sin against thee (for there is no man which sinneth
not) and thou be angri with them and deliv them over befor their
enemi and they carri them away captiv unto a land far off or
near; 6:37 yet if they bethink themselv in the land whither they are
carri captiv and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their
captiv say we have sin we have done amiss and have dealt
wickedly; 6:38 if they return to thee with all their heart and with
all their soul in the land of their captiv whither they have
carri them captiv and pray toward their land which thou gavest
unto their father and toward the citi which thou hast chosen and
toward the hous which i have built for thi name: 6:39 then hear thou
from the heaven even from thi dwell place their prayer and their
supplic and maintain their caus and forgiv thi peopl which
have sin against thee

6:40 now my god let i beseech thee thine eye be open and let
thine ear be attent unto the prayer that is made in thi place

6:41 now therefor aris o lord god into thi rest place thou
and the ark of thi strength: let thi priest o lord god be cloth
with salvat and let thi saint rejoic in good

6:42 o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed: rememb
the merci of david thi servant

7:1 now when solomon had made an end of pray the fire came down
from heaven and consum the burnt offer and the sacrifices; and
the glori of the lord fill the hous

7:2 and the priest could not enter into the hous of the lord
becaus the glori of the lord had fill the lord hous

7:3 and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down
and the glori of the lord upon the hous they bow themselv with
their face to the ground upon the pavement and worship and
prais the lord say for he is good; for hi merci endureth for
ever

7:4 then the king and all the peopl offer sacrific befor the
lord

7:5 and king solomon offer a sacrific of twenti and two thousand
oxen and an hundr and twenti thousand sheep: so the king and all
the peopl dedic the hous of god

7:6 and the priest wait on their offices: the levit also with
instrument of musick of the lord which david the king had made to
prais the lord becaus hi merci endureth for ever when david
prais by their ministry; and the priest sound trumpet befor
them and all israel stood

7:7 moreov solomon hallow the middl of the court that wa befor
the hous of the lord: for there he offer burnt offer and the
fat of the peac offer becaus the brasen altar which solomon had
made wa not abl to receiv the burnt offer and the meat
offer and the fat

7:8 also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven day and all
israel with him a veri great congreg from the enter in of
hamath unto the river of egypt

7:9 and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
the dedic of the altar seven day and the feast seven day

7:10 and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
the peopl away into their tent glad and merri in heart for the
good that the lord had shew unto david and to solomon and to
israel hi peopl

7:11 thu solomon finish the hous of the lord and the king
house: and all that came into solomon heart to make in the hous of
the lord and in hi own hous he prosper effect

7:12 and the lord appear to solomon by night and said unto him i
have heard thi prayer and have chosen thi place to myself for an
hous of sacrific

7:13 if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the
locust to devour the land or if i send pestil among my people;
7:14 if my peopl which are call by my name shall humbl
themselv and pray and seek my face and turn from their wick
ways; then will i hear from heaven and will forgiv their sin and
will heal their land

7:15 now mine eye shall be open and mine ear attent unto the prayer
that is made in thi place

7:16 for now have i chosen and sanctifi thi hous that my name may
be there for ever: and mine eye and mine heart shall be there
perpetu

7:17 and as for thee if thou wilt walk befor me as david thi father
walk and do accord to all that i have command thee and shalt
observ my statut and my judgments; 7:18 then will i stablish the
throne of thi kingdom accord as i have coven with david thi
father say there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel

7:19 but if ye turn away and forsak my statut and my command
which i have set befor you and shall go and serv other god and
worship them; 7:20 then will i pluck them up by the root out of my
land which i have given them; and thi hous which i have sanctifi
for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a
proverb and a byword among all nation

7:21 and thi hous which is high shall be an astonish to everi
one that passeth by it; so that he shall say whi hath the lord done
thu unto thi land and unto thi house? 7:22 and it shall be
answer becaus they forsook the lord god of their father which
brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other
god and worship them and serv them: therefor hath he brought
all thi evil upon them

8:1 and it came to pass at the end of twenti year wherein solomon
had built the hous of the lord and hi own hous 8:2 that the
citi which huram had restor to solomon solomon built them and
caus the children of israel to dwell there

8:3 and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevail against it

8:4 and he built tadmor in the wilder and all the store citi
which he built in hamath

8:5 also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether
fenc citi with wall gate and bars; 8:6 and baalath and all
the store citi that solomon had and all the chariot citi and the
citi of the horsemen and all that solomon desir to build in
jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of hi
dominion

8:7 as for all the peopl that were left of the hittit and the
amorit and the perizzit and the hivit and the jebusit
which were not of israel 8:8 but of their children who were left
after them in the land whom the children of israel consum not them
did solomon make to pay tribut until thi day

8:9 but of the children of israel did solomon make no servant for hi
work; but they were men of war and chief of hi captain and
captain of hi chariot and horsemen

8:10 and these were the chief of king solomon offic even two
hundr and fifti that bare rule over the peopl

8:11 and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the citi of
david unto the hous that he had built for her: for he said my wife
shall not dwell in the hous of david king of israel becaus the
place are holi whereunto the ark of the lord hath come

8:12 then solomon offer burnt offer unto the lord on the altar
of the lord which he had built befor the porch 8:13 even after a
certain rate everi day offer accord to the command of
mose on the sabbath and on the new moon and on the solemn
feast three time in the year even in the feast of unleaven
bread and in the feast of week and in the feast of tabernacl

8:14 and he appoint accord to the order of david hi father the
cours of the priest to their servic and the levit to their
charg to prais and minist befor the priest as the duti of
everi day required: the porter also by their cours at everi gate:
for so had david the man of god command

8:15 and they depart not from the command of the king unto the
priest and levit concern ani matter or concern the
treasur

8:16 now all the work of solomon wa prepar unto the day of the
foundat of the hous of the lord and until it wa finish so the
hous of the lord wa perfect

8:17 then went solomon to eziongeb and to eloth at the sea side in
the land of edom

8:18 and huram sent him by the hand of hi servant ship and
servant that had knowledg of the sea; and they went with the
servant of solomon to ophir and took thenc four hundr and fifti
talent of gold and brought them to king solomon

9:1 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came
to prove solomon with hard question at jerusalem with a veri great
compani and camel that bare spice and gold in abund and
preciou stones: and when she wa come to solomon she commun with
him of all that wa in her heart

9:2 and solomon told her all her questions: and there wa noth hid
from solomon which he told her not

9:3 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and
the hous that he had built 9:4 and the meat of hi tabl and the
sit of hi servant and the attend of hi minist and
their apparel; hi cupbear also and their apparel; and hi ascent
by which he went up into the hous of the lord; there wa no more
spirit in her

9:5 and she said to the king it wa a true report which i heard in
mine own land of thine act and of thi wisdom: 9:6 howbeit i believ
not their word until i came and mine eye had seen it: and behold
the one half of the great of thi wisdom wa not told me: for thou
exceedest the fame that i heard

9:7 happi are thi men and happi are these thi servant which stand
continu befor thee and hear thi wisdom

9:8 bless be the lord thi god which delight in thee to set thee
on hi throne to be king for the lord thi god: becaus thi god love
israel to establish them for ever therefor made he thee king over
them to do judgment and justic

9:9 and she gave the king an hundr and twenti talent of gold and
of spice great abund and preciou stones: neither wa there ani
such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon

9:10 and the servant also of huram and the servant of solomon
which brought gold from ophir brought algum tree and preciou
stone

9:11 and the king made of the algum tree terrac to the hous of the
lord and to the king palac and harp and psalteri for singers:
and there were none such seen befor in the land of judah

9:12 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desir
whatsoev she ask besid that which she had brought unto the king
so she turn and went away to her own land she and her servant

9:13 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year wa six
hundr and threescor and six talent of gold; 9:14 besid that which
chapmen and merchant brought and all the king of arabia and
governor of the countri brought gold and silver to solomon

9:15 and king solomon made two hundr target of beaten gold: six
hundr shekel of beaten gold went to one target

9:16 and three hundr shield made he of beaten gold: three hundr
shekel of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the hous
of the forest of lebanon

9:17 moreov the king made a great throne of ivori and overlaid it
with pure gold

9:18 and there were six step to the throne with a footstool of gold
which were fasten to the throne and stay on each side of the
sit place and two lion stand by the stays: 9:19 and twelv
lion stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six step
there wa not the like made in ani kingdom

9:20 and all the drink vessel of king solomon were of gold and
all the vessel of the hous of the forest of lebanon were of pure
gold: none were of silver; it wa not ani thing account of in the
day of solomon

9:21 for the king ship went to tarshish with the servant of huram:
everi three year onc came the ship of tarshish bring gold and
silver ivori and ape and peacock

9:22 and king solomon pass all the king of the earth in rich and
wisdom

9:23 and all the king of the earth sought the presenc of solomon to
hear hi wisdom that god had put in hi heart

9:24 and they brought everi man hi present vessel of silver and
vessel of gold and raiment har and spice hors and mule
a rate year by year

9:25 and solomon had four thousand stall for hors and chariot and
twelv thousand horsemen; whom he bestow in the chariot citi and
with the king at jerusalem

9:26 and he reign over all the king from the river even unto the
land of the philistin and to the border of egypt

9:27 and the king made silver in jerusalem as stone and cedar tree
made he as the sycomor tree that are in the low plain in abund

9:28 and they brought unto solomon hors out of egypt and out of all
land

9:29 now the rest of the act of solomon first and last are they not
written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the propheci of
ahijah the shilonit and in the vision of iddo the seer against
jeroboam the son of nebat? 9:30 and solomon reign in jerusalem over
all israel forti year

9:31 and solomon slept with hi father and he wa buri in the citi
of david hi father: and rehoboam hi son reign in hi stead

10:1 and rehoboam went to shechem: for to shechem were all israel come
to make him king

10:2 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who wa in
egypt whither he fled from the presenc of solomon the king heard
it that jeroboam return out of egypt

10:3 and they sent and call him so jeroboam and all israel came and
spake to rehoboam say 10:4 thi father made our yoke grievous: now
therefor eas thou somewhat the grievou servitud of thi father and
hi heavi yoke that he put upon us and we will serv thee

10:5 and he said unto them come again unto me after three day and
the peopl depart

10:6 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
befor solomon hi father while he yet live say what counsel
give ye me to return answer to thi people? 10:7 and they spake unto
him say if thou be kind to thi peopl and pleas them and
speak good word to them they will be thi servant for ever

10:8 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took
counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood
befor him

10:9 and he said unto them what advic give ye that we may return
answer to thi peopl which have spoken to me say eas somewhat
the yoke that thi father did put upon us? 10:10 and the young men
that were brought up with him spake unto him say thu shalt thou
answer the peopl that spake unto thee say thi father made our
yoke heavi but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thu shalt thou
say unto them my littl finger shall be thicker than my father
loin

10:11 for wherea my father put a heavi yoke upon you i will put more
to your yoke: my father chastis you with whip but i will chastis
you with scorpion

10:12 so jeroboam and all the peopl came to rehoboam on the third
day as the king bade say come again to me on the third day

10:13 and the king answer them roughly; and king rehoboam forsook
the counsel of the old men 10:14 and answer them after the advic
of the young men say my father made your yoke heavi but i will
add thereto: my father chastis you with whip but i will chastis
you with scorpion

10:15 so the king hearken not unto the people: for the caus wa of
god that the lord might perform hi word which he spake by the hand
of ahijah the shilonit to jeroboam the son of nebat

10:16 and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
them the peopl answer the king say what portion have we in
david? and we have none inherit in the son of jesse: everi man to
your tent o israel: and now david see to thine own hous so all
israel went to their tent

10:17 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the citi of
judah rehoboam reign over them

10:18 then king rehoboam sent hadoram that wa over the tribute; and
the children of israel stone him with stone that he die but king
rehoboam made speed to get him up to hi chariot to flee to
jerusalem

10:19 and israel rebel against the hous of david unto thi day

11:1 and when rehoboam wa come to jerusalem he gather of the hous
of judah and benjamin an hundr and fourscor thousand chosen men
which were warrior to fight against israel that he might bring the
kingdom again to rehoboam

11:2 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god say
11:3 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all
israel in judah and benjamin say 11:4 thu saith the lord ye
shall not go up nor fight against your brethren: return everi man to
hi house: for thi thing is done of me and they obey the word of
the lord and return from go against jeroboam

11:5 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built citi for defenc in
judah

11:6 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa 11:7 and bethzur
and shoco and adullam 11:8 and gath and mareshah and ziph 11:9
and adoraim and lachish and azekah 11:10 and zorah and aijalon
and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenc citi

11:11 and he fortifi the strong hold and put captain in them and
store of victual and of oil and wine

11:12 and in everi sever citi he put shield and spear and made
them exceed strong have judah and benjamin on hi side

11:13 and the priest and the levit that were in all israel resort
to him out of all their coast

11:14 for the levit left their suburb and their possess and
came to judah and jerusalem: for jeroboam and hi son had cast them
off from execut the priest offic unto the lord: 11:15 and he
ordain him priest for the high place and for the devil and for
the calv which he had made

11:16 and after them out of all the tribe of israel such as set their
heart to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrific
unto the lord god of their father

11:17 so they strengthen the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the
son of solomon strong three years: for three year they walk in the
way of david and solomon

11:18 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son
of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse;
11:19 which bare him children; jeush and shamariah and zaham

11:20 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom; which
bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith

11:21 and rehoboam love maachah the daughter of absalom abov all hi
wive and hi concubines: (for he took eighteen wive and threescor
concubines; and begat twenti and eight son and threescor
daughters) 11:22 and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the
chief to be ruler among hi brethren: for he thought to make him
king

11:23 and he dealt wise and dispers of all hi children
throughout all the countri of judah and benjamin unto everi fenc
city: and he gave them victual in abund and he desir mani
wive

12:1 and it came to pass when rehoboam had establish the kingdom
and had strengthen himself he forsook the law of the lord and all
israel with him

12:2 and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem becaus they had
transgress against the lord 12:3 with twelv hundr chariot and
threescor thousand horsemen: and the peopl were without number that
came with him out of egypt; the lubim the sukkiim and the
ethiopian

12:4 and he took the fenc citi which pertain to judah and came
to jerusalem

12:5 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princ of
judah that were gather togeth to jerusalem becaus of shishak
and said unto them thu saith the lord ye have forsaken me and
therefor have i also left you in the hand of shishak

12:6 whereupon the princ of israel and the king humbl themselves;
and they said the lord is righteou

12:7 and when the lord saw that they humbl themselv the word of
the lord came to shemaiah say they have humbl themselves;
therefor i will not destroy them but i will grant them some
deliverance; and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by
the hand of shishak

12:8 nevertheless they shall be hi servants; that they may know my
servic and the servic of the kingdom of the countri

12:9 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away
the treasur of the hous of the lord and the treasur of the
king house; he took all: he carri away also the shield of gold
which solomon had made

12:10 instead of which king rehoboam made shield of brass and
commit them to the hand of the chief of the guard that kept the
entranc of the king hous

12:11 and when the king enter into the hous of the lord the guard
came and fetch them and brought them again into the guard chamber

12:12 and when he humbl himself the wrath of the lord turn from
him that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in judah
thing went well

12:13 so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem and reigned:
for rehoboam wa one and forti year old when he began to reign and
he reign seventeen year in jerusalem the citi which the lord had
chosen out of all the tribe of israel to put hi name there and hi
mother name wa naamah an ammonitess

12:14 and he did evil becaus he prepar not hi heart to seek the
lord

12:15 now the act of rehoboam first and last are they not written
in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concern
genealogies? and there were war between rehoboam and jeroboam
continu

12:16 and rehoboam slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi
of david: and abijah hi son reign in hi stead

13:1 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign
over judah

13:2 he reign three year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa
michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there wa war between
abijah and jeroboam

13:3 and abijah set the battl in array with an armi of valiant men of
war even four hundr thousand chosen men: jeroboam also set the
battl in array against him with eight hundr thousand chosen men
be mighti men of valour

13:4 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount
ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel; 13:5 ought
ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over
israel to david for ever even to him and to hi son by a coven of
salt? 13:6 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the
son of david is risen up and hath rebel against hi lord

13:7 and there are gather unto him vain men the children of belial
and have strengthen themselv against rehoboam the son of solomon
when rehoboam wa young and tenderheart and could not withstand
them

13:8 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand
of the son of david; and ye be a great multitud and there are with
your golden calv which jeroboam made you for god

13:9 have ye not cast out the priest of the lord the son of aaron
and the levit and have made you priest after the manner of the
nation of other lands? so that whosoev cometh to consecr himself
with a young bullock and seven ram the same may be a priest of them
that are no god

13:10 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken
him; and the priest which minist unto the lord are the son of
aaron and the levit wait upon their business: 13:11 and they burn
unto the lord everi morn and everi even burnt sacrific and
sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure
table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof to burn
everi evening: for we keep the charg of the lord our god; but ye have
forsaken him

13:12 and behold god himself is with us for our captain and hi
priest with sound trumpet to cri alarm against you o children of
israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers; for ye
shall not prosper

13:13 but jeroboam caus an ambush to come about behind them: so
they were befor judah and the ambush wa behind them

13:14 and when judah look back behold the battl wa befor and
behind: and they cri unto the lord and the priest sound with the
trumpet

13:15 then the men of judah gave a shout: and as the men of judah
shout it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel
befor abijah and judah

13:16 and the children of israel fled befor judah: and god deliv
them into their hand

13:17 and abijah and hi peopl slew them with a great slaughter: so
there fell down slain of israel five hundr thousand chosen men

13:18 thu the children of israel were brought under at that time and
the children of judah prevail becaus they reli upon the lord god
of their father

13:19 and abijah pursu after jeroboam and took citi from him
bethel with the town thereof and jeshanah with the town thereof
and ephraim with the town thereof

13:20 neither did jeroboam recov strength again in the day of
abijah: and the lord struck him and he die

13:21 but abijah wax mighti and marri fourteen wive and begat
twenti and two son and sixteen daughter

13:22 and the rest of the act of abijah and hi way and hi
say are written in the stori of the prophet iddo

14:1 so abijah slept with hi father and they buri him in the citi
of david: and asa hi son reign in hi stead in hi day the land
wa quiet ten year

14:2 and asa did that which wa good and right in the eye of the lord
hi god: 14:3 for he took away the altar of the strang god and the
high place and brake down the imag and cut down the groves: 14:4
and command judah to seek the lord god of their father and to do
the law and the command

14:5 also he took away out of all the citi of judah the high place
and the images: and the kingdom wa quiet befor him

14:6 and he built fenc citi in judah: for the land had rest and
he had no war in those years; becaus the lord had given him rest

14:7 therefor he said unto judah let us build these citi and make
about them wall and tower gate and bar while the land is yet
befor us; becaus we have sought the lord our god we have sought
him and he hath given us rest on everi side so they built and
prosper

14:8 and asa had an armi of men that bare target and spear out of
judah three hundr thousand; and out of benjamin that bare shield
and drew bow two hundr and fourscor thousand: all these were
mighti men of valour

14:9 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host
of a thousand thousand and three hundr chariots; and came unto
mareshah

14:10 then asa went out against him and they set the battl in array
in the valley of zephathah at mareshah

14:11 and asa cri unto the lord hi god and said lord it is
noth with thee to help whether with mani or with them that have
no power: help us o lord our god; for we rest on thee and in thi
name we go against thi multitud o lord thou art our god; let no
man prevail against thee

14:12 so the lord smote the ethiopian befor asa and befor judah;
and the ethiopian fled

14:13 and asa and the peopl that were with him pursu them unto
gerar: and the ethiopian were overthrown that they could not recov
themselves; for they were destroy befor the lord and befor hi
host; and they carri away veri much spoil

14:14 and they smote all the citi round about gerar; for the fear of
the lord came upon them: and they spoil all the cities; for there
wa exceed much spoil in them

14:15 they smote also the tent of cattl and carri away sheep and
camel in abund and return to jerusalem

15:1 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded: 15:2 and
he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all
judah and benjamin; the lord is with you while ye be with him; and if
ye seek him he will be found of you; but if ye forsak him he will
forsak you

15:3 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and
without a teach priest and without law

15:4 but when they in their troubl did turn unto the lord god of
israel and sought him he wa found of them

15:5 and in those time there wa no peac to him that went out nor
to him that came in but great vexat were upon all the inhabit
of the countri

15:6 and nation wa destroy of nation and citi of city: for god did
vex them with all advers

15:7 be ye strong therefor and let not your hand be weak: for your
work shall be reward

15:8 and when asa heard these word and the propheci of ode the
prophet he took courag and put away the abomin idol out of all
the land of judah and benjamin and out of the citi which he had
taken from mount ephraim and renew the altar of the lord that wa
befor the porch of the lord

15:9 and he gather all judah and benjamin and the stranger with
them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon: for they fell to
him out of israel in abund when they saw that the lord hi god
wa with him

15:10 so they gather themselv togeth at jerusalem in the third
month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa

15:11 and they offer unto the lord the same time of the spoil which
they had brought seven hundr oxen and seven thousand sheep

15:12 and they enter into a coven to seek the lord god of their
father with all their heart and with all their soul; 15:13 that
whosoev would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to
death whether small or great whether man or woman

15:14 and they sware unto the lord with a loud voic and with
shout and with trumpet and with cornet

15:15 and all judah rejoic at the oath: for they had sworn with all
their heart and sought him with their whole desire; and he wa found
of them: and the lord gave them rest round about

15:16 and also concern maachah the mother of asa the king he
remov her from be queen becaus she had made an idol in a grove:
and asa cut down her idol and stamp it and burnt it at the brook
kidron

15:17 but the high place were not taken away out of israel:
nevertheless the heart of asa wa perfect all hi day

15:18 and he brought into the hous of god the thing that hi father
had dedic and that he himself had dedic silver and gold
and vessel

15:19 and there wa no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
the reign of asa

16:1 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of
israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he
might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah

16:2 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasur of the
hous of the lord and of the king hous and sent to benhadad king
of syria that dwelt at damascu say 16:3 there is a leagu
between me and thee as there wa between my father and thi father:
behold i have sent thee silver and gold; go break thi leagu with
baasha king of israel that he may depart from me

16:4 and benhadad hearken unto king asa and sent the captain of
hi armi against the citi of israel; and they smote ijon and dan
and abelmaim and all the store citi of naphtali

16:5 and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off
build of ramah and let hi work ceas

16:6 then asa the king took all judah; and they carri away the
stone of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha wa
building; and he built therewith geba and mizpah

16:7 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and

he deliv them into thine hand

16:9 for the eye of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole
earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly: therefor from
henceforth thou shalt have war

16:10 then asa wa wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house;
for he wa in a rage with him becaus of thi thing and asa oppress
some of the peopl the same time

16:11 and behold the act of asa first and last lo they are

17:3 and the lord wa with jehoshaphat becaus he walk in the first
way of hi father david and sought not unto baalim; 17:4 but sought
to the lord god of hi father and walk in hi command and not

17:5 therefor the lord stablish the kingdom in hi hand; and all
judah brought to jehoshaphat presents; and he had rich and honour in
abund

17:6 and hi heart wa lift up in the way of the lord: moreov he
took away the high place and grove out of judah

17:7 also in the third year of hi reign he sent to hi princ even

jehoram priest

17:9 and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord
with them and went about throughout all the citi of judah and
taught the peopl

17:10 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdom of the land
that were round about judah so that they made no war against
jehoshaphat

17:11 also some of the philistin brought jehoshaphat present and
tribut silver; and the arabian brought him flock seven thousand

17:12 and jehoshaphat wax great exceedingly; and he built in judah

17:18 and next him wa jehozabad and with him an hundr and
fourscor thousand readi prepar for the war

17:19 these wait on the king besid those whom the king put in the
fenc citi throughout all judah

18:1 now jehoshaphat had rich and honour in abund and join
affin with ahab

18:2 and after certain year he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab
kill sheep and oxen for him in abund and for the peopl that he
had with him and persuad him to go up with him to ramothgilead

18:3 and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt
thou go with me to ramothgilead? and he answer him i am as thou
art and my peopl as thi people; and we will be with thee in the war

18:4 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquir i pray
thee at the word of the lord to day

18:5 therefor the king of israel gather togeth of prophet four
hundr men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to
battl or shall i forbear? and they said go up; for god will deliv
it into the king hand

18:6 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
besid that we might enquir of him? 18:7 and the king of israel
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquir of
the lord: but i hate him; for he never prophesi good unto me but
alway evil: the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat
said let not the king say so

18:8 and the king of israel call for one of hi offic and said
fetch quickli micaiah the son of imla

18:9 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either
of them on hi throne cloth in their robe and they sat in a void
place at the enter in of the gate of samaria; and all the prophet
prophesi befor them

18:10 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horn of iron
and said thu saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until
they be consum

18:11 and all the prophet prophesi so say go up to
ramothgilead and prosper: for the lord shall deliv it into the hand
of the king

18:12 and the messeng that went to call micaiah spake to him
say behold the word of the prophet declar good to the king
with one assent; let thi word therefor i pray thee be like one of
their and speak thou good

18:13 and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith
that will i speak

18:14 and when he wa come to the king the king said unto him
micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battl or shall i forbear?
and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be deliv into
your hand

18:15 and the king said to him how mani time shall i adjur thee
that thou say noth but the truth to me in the name of the lord?
18:16 then he said i did see all israel scatter upon the mountain
as sheep that have no shepherd: and the lord said these have no
master; let them return therefor everi man to hi hous in peac

18:17 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee
that he would not prophesi good unto me but evil? 18:18 again he
said therefor hear the word of the lord; i saw the lord sit upon
hi throne and all the host of heaven stand on hi right hand and
on hi left

18:19 and the lord said who shall entic ahab king of israel that he
may go up and fall at ramothgilead? and one spake say after thi
manner and anoth say after that manner

18:20 then there came out a spirit and stood befor the lord and
said i will entic him and the lord said unto him wherewith? 18:21
and he said i will go out and be a lie spirit in the mouth of all
hi prophet and the lord said thou shalt entic him and thou shalt
also prevail: go out and do even so

18:22 now therefor behold the lord hath put a lie spirit in the
mouth of these thi prophet and the lord hath spoken evil against
thee

18:23 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah
upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from
me to speak unto thee? 18:24 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself

18:25 then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carri him
back to amon the governor of the citi and to joash the king son;
18:26 and say thu saith the king put thi fellow in the prison and
feed him with bread of afflict and with water of afflict until
i return in peac

18:27 and micaiah said if thou certainli return in peac then hath
not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye peopl

18:28 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up
to ramothgilead

18:29 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguis
myself and i will go to the battle; but put thou on thi robe so the
king of israel disguis himself; and they went to the battl

18:30 now the king of syria had command the captain of the chariot
that were with him say fight ye not with small or great save
onli with the king of israel

18:31 and it came to pass when the captain of the chariot saw
jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefor they
compass about him to fight: but jehoshaphat cri out and the lord
help him; and god move them to depart from him

18:32 for it came to pass that when the captain of the chariot
perceiv that it wa not the king of israel they turn back again
from pursu him

18:33 and a certain man drew a bow at a ventur and smote the king of
israel between the joint of the harness: therefor he said to hi
chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carri me out of the
host; for i am wound

18:34 and the battl increas that day: howbeit the king of israel
stay himself up in hi chariot against the syrian until the even:
and about the time of the sun go down he die

19:1 and jehoshaphat the king of judah return to hi hous in peac
to jerusalem

19:2 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and
said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodli and love
them that hate the lord? therefor is wrath upon thee from befor the
lord

19:3 nevertheless there are good thing found in thee in that thou
hast taken away the grove out of the land and hast prepar thine
heart to seek god

19:4 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem: and he went out again through
the peopl from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto
the lord god of their father

19:5 and he set judg in the land throughout all the fenc citi of
judah citi by citi 19:6 and said to the judg take heed what ye
do: for ye judg not for man but for the lord who is with you in the
judgment

19:7 wherefor now let the fear of the lord be upon you; take heed and
do it: for there is no iniqu with the lord our god nor respect of
person nor take of gift

19:8 moreov in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levit and of
the priest and of the chief of the father of israel for the
judgment of the lord and for controversi when they return to
jerusalem

19:9 and he charg them say thu shall ye do in the fear of the
lord faith and with a perfect heart

19:10 and what caus soever shall come to you of your brethren that
dwell in your citi between blood and blood between law and
command statut and judgment ye shall even warn them that they
trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon
your brethren: thi do and ye shall not trespass

19:11 and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matter
of the lord; and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the hous
of judah for all the king matters: also the levit shall be
offic befor you deal courag and the lord shall be with the
good

20:1 it came to pass after thi also that the children of moab and
the children of ammon and with them other besid the ammonit came
against jehoshaphat to battl

20:2 then there came some that told jehoshaphat say there cometh
a great multitud against thee from beyond the sea on thi side syria;
and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi

20:3 and jehoshaphat fear and set himself to seek the lord and
proclaim a fast throughout all judah

20:4 and judah gather themselv togeth to ask help of the lord:
even out of all the citi of judah they came to seek the lord

20:5 and jehoshaphat stood in the congreg of judah and jerusalem
in the hous of the lord befor the new court 20:6 and said o lord
god of our father art not thou god in heaven? and rulest not thou
over all the kingdom of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not
power and might so that none is abl to withstand thee? 20:7 art not
thou our god who didst drive out the inhabit of thi land befor
thi peopl israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thi friend for
ever? 20:8 and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuari
therein for thi name say 20:9 if when evil cometh upon us as
the sword judgment or pestil or famin we stand befor thi
hous and in thi presenc (for thi name is in thi house) and cri
unto thee in our afflict then thou wilt hear and help

20:10 and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir
whom thou wouldest not let israel invad when they came out of the
land of egypt but they turn from them and destroy them not;
20:11 behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thi
possess which thou hast given us to inherit

20:12 o our god wilt thou not judg them? for we have no might
against thi great compani that cometh against us; neither know we
what to do: but our eye are upon thee

20:13 and all judah stood befor the lord with their littl one
their wive and their children

20:14 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the
son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levit of the son of asaph
came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation; 20:15
and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem
and thou king jehoshaphat thu saith the lord unto you be not afraid
nor dismay by reason of thi great multitude; for the battl is not
your but god

20:16 to morrow go ye down against them: behold they come up by the
cliff of ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook befor
the wilder of jeruel

20:17 ye shall not need to fight in thi battle: set yourselv stand
ye still and see the salvat of the lord with you o judah and
jerusalem: fear not nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:
for the lord will be with you

20:18 and jehoshaphat bow hi head with hi face to the ground: and
all judah and the inhabit of jerusalem fell befor the lord
worship the lord

20:19 and the levit of the children of the kohathit and of the
children of the korhit stood up to prais the lord god of israel
with a loud voic on high

20:20 and they rose earli in the morn and went forth into the
wilder of tekoa: and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and
said hear me o judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem; believ in
the lord your god so shall ye be established; believ hi prophet
so shall ye prosper

20:21 and when he had consult with the peopl he appoint singer
unto the lord and that should prais the beauti of holi as they
went out befor the armi and to say prais the lord; for hi merci
endureth for ever

20:22 and when they began to sing and to prais the lord set
ambush against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which
were come against judah; and they were smitten

20:23 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the
inhabit of mount seir utterli to slay and destroy them: and when
they had made an end of the inhabit of seir everi one help to
destroy anoth

20:24 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilder
they look unto the multitud and behold they were dead bodi
fallen to the earth and none escap

20:25 and when jehoshaphat and hi peopl came to take away the spoil
of them they found among them in abund both rich with the dead
bodi and preciou jewel which they strip off for themselv
more than they could carri away: and they were three day in gather
of the spoil it wa so much

20:26 and on the fourth day they assembl themselv in the valley of
berachah; for there they bless the lord: therefor the name of the
same place wa call the valley of berachah unto thi day

20:27 then they return everi man of judah and jerusalem and
jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with
joy; for the lord had made them to rejoic over their enemi

20:28 and they came to jerusalem with psalteri and harp and
trumpet unto the hous of the lord

20:29 and the fear of god wa on all the kingdom of those countri
when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemi of
israel

20:30 so the realm of jehoshaphat wa quiet: for hi god gave him rest
round about

20:31 and jehoshaphat reign over judah: he wa thirti and five year
old when he began to reign and he reign twenti and five year in
jerusalem

and hi mother name wa azubah the daughter of shilhi

20:32 and he walk in the way of asa hi father and depart not
from it do that which wa right in the sight of the lord

20:33 howbeit the high place were not taken away: for as yet the
peopl had not prepar their heart unto the god of their father

20:34 now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat first and last behold
they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is
mention in the book of the king of israel

20:35 and after thi did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with
ahaziah king of israel who did veri wickedly: 20:36 and he join
himself with him to make ship to go to tarshish: and they made the
ship in eziongab

20:37 then eliez the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesi against
jehoshaphat say becaus thou hast join thyself with ahaziah
the lord hath broken thi work and the ship were broken that they
were not abl to go to tarshish

21:1 now jehoshaphat slept with hi father and wa buri with hi
father in the citi of david and jehoram hi son reign in hi
stead

21:2 and he had brethren the son of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel
and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah: all these
were the son of jehoshaphat king of israel

21:3 and their father gave them great gift of silver and of gold
and of preciou thing with fenc citi in judah: but the kingdom
gave he to jehoram; becaus he wa the firstborn

21:4 now when jehoram wa risen up to the kingdom of hi father he
strengthen himself and slew all hi brethren with the sword and
diver also of the princ of israel

21:5 jehoram wa thirti and two year old when he began to reign and
he reign eight year in jerusalem

21:6 and he walk in the way of the king of israel like as did the
hous of ahab: for he had the daughter of ahab to wife: and he wrought
that which wa evil in the eye of the lord

21:7 howbeit the lord would not destroy the hous of david becaus of
the coven that he had made with david and as he promis to give a
light to him and to hi son for ever

21:8 in hi day the edomit revolt from under the dominion of
judah and made themselv a king

21:9 then jehoram went forth with hi princ and all hi chariot
with him: and he rose up by night and smote the edomit which
compass him in and the captain of the chariot

21:10 so the edomit revolt from under the hand of judah unto thi
day

the same time also did libnah revolt from under hi hand; becaus he
had forsaken the lord god of hi father

21:11 moreov he made high place in the mountain of judah and
caus the inhabit of jerusalem to commit fornic and
compel judah thereto

21:12 and there came a write to him from elijah the prophet say
thu saith the lord god of david thi father becaus thou hast not
walk in the way of jehoshaphat thi father nor in the way of asa
king of judah 21:13 but hast walk in the way of the king of
israel and hast made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to go a
whore like to the whoredom of the hous of ahab and also hast
slain thi brethren of thi father hous which were better than
thyself: 21:14 behold with a great plagu will the lord smite thi
peopl and thi children and thi wive and all thi goods: 21:15 and
thou shalt have great sick by diseas of thi bowel until thi
bowel fall out by reason of the sick day by day

21:16 moreov the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the
philistin and of the arabian that were near the ethiopians: 21:17
and they came up into judah and brake into it and carri away all
the substanc that wa found in the king hous and hi son also
and hi wives; so that there wa never a son left him save jehoahaz
the youngest of hi son

21:18 and after all thi the lord smote him in hi bowel with an
incur diseas

21:19 and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of
two year hi bowel fell out by reason of hi sickness: so he die
of sore diseas and hi peopl made no burn for him like the
burn of hi father

21:20 thirti and two year old wa he when he began to reign and he
reign in jerusalem eight year and depart without be desir
howbeit they buri him in the citi of david but not in the
sepulchr of the king

22:1 and the inhabit of jerusalem made ahaziah hi youngest son
king in hi stead: for the band of men that came with the arabian to
the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king
of judah reign

22:2 forti and two year old wa ahaziah when he began to reign and
he reign one year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa athaliah
the daughter of omri

22:3 he also walk in the way of the hous of ahab: for hi mother
wa hi counsellor to do wickedli

22:4 wherefor he did evil in the sight of the lord like the hous of
ahab: for they were hi counsellor after the death of hi father to
hi destruct

22:5 he walk also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son
of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at
ramothgilead: and the syrian smote joram

22:6 and he return to be heal in jezreel becaus of the wound
which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of
syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see
jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel becaus he wa sick

22:7 and the destruct of ahaziah wa of god by come to joram: for
when he wa come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of
nimshi whom the lord had anoint to cut off the hous of ahab

22:8 and it came to pass that when jehu wa execut judgment upon
the hous of ahab and found the princ of judah and the son of the
brethren of ahaziah that minist to ahaziah he slew them

22:9 and he sought ahaziah: and they caught him (for he wa hid in
samaria) and brought him to jehu: and when they had slain him they
buri him: becaus said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who
sought the lord with all hi heart so the hous of ahaziah had no
power to keep still the kingdom

22:10 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son wa
dead she aros and destroy all the seed royal of the hous of
judah

22:11 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son
of ahaziah and stole him from among the king son that were slain
and put him and hi nurs in a bedchamb so jehoshabeath the
daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest (for she
wa the sister of ahaziah) hid him from athaliah so that she slew
him not

22:12 and he wa with them hid in the hous of god six years: and
athaliah reign over the land

23:1 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself and took
the captain of hundr azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the
son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obe and maaseiah the son of
adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into coven with him

23:2 and they went about in judah and gather the levit out of all
the citi of judah and the chief of the father of israel and they
came to jerusalem

23:3 and all the congreg made a coven with the king in the
hous of god and he said unto them behold the king son shall
reign as the lord hath said of the son of david

23:4 thi is the thing that ye shall do; a third part of you enter
on the sabbath of the priest and of the levit shall be porter of
the doors; 23:5 and a third part shall be at the king house; and a
third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the peopl shall be
in the court of the hous of the lord

23:6 but let none come into the hous of the lord save the priest
and they that minist of the levites; they shall go in for they are
holy: but all the peopl shall keep the watch of the lord

23:7 and the levit shall compass the king round about everi man
with hi weapon in hi hand; and whosoev els cometh into the
hous he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he
cometh in and when he goeth out

23:8 so the levit and all judah did accord to all thing that
jehoiada the priest had command and took everi man hi men that
were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the
sabbath: for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the cours

23:9 moreov jehoiada the priest deliv to the captain of
hundr spear and buckler and shield that had been king
david which were in the hous of god

23:10 and he set all the peopl everi man have hi weapon in hi
hand from the right side of the templ to the left side of the
templ along by the altar and the templ by the king round about

23:11 then they brought out the king son and put upon him the
crown and gave him the testimoni and made him king and jehoiada and
hi son anoint him and said god save the king

23:12 now when athaliah heard the nois of the peopl run and
prais the king she came to the peopl into the hous of the lord:
23:13 and she look and behold the king stood at hi pillar at the
enter in and the princ and the trumpet by the king: and all the
peopl of the land rejoic and sound with trumpet also the
singer with instrument of musick and such as taught to sing prais
then athaliah rent her cloth and said treason treason

23:14 then jehoiada the priest brought out the captain of hundr
that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the
ranges: and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for
the priest said slay her not in the hous of the lord

23:15 so they laid hand on her; and when she wa come to the enter
of the hors gate by the king hous they slew her there

23:16 and jehoiada made a coven between him and between all the
peopl and between the king that they should be the lord peopl

23:17 then all the peopl went to the hous of baal and brake it
down and brake hi altar and hi imag in piec and slew mattan
the priest of baal befor the altar

23:18 also jehoiada appoint the offic of the hous of the lord by
the hand of the priest the levit whom david had distribut in the
hous of the lord to offer the burnt offer of the lord as it is
written in the law of mose with rejoic and with sing as it

23:19 and he set the porter at the gate of the hous of the lord
that none which wa unclean in ani thing should enter in

23:20 and he took the captain of hundr and the nobl and the
governor of the peopl and all the peopl of the land and brought
down the king from the hous of the lord: and they came through the
high gate into the king hous and set the king upon the throne of
the kingdom

23:21 and all the peopl of the land rejoiced: and the citi wa quiet
after that they had slain athaliah with the sword

24:1 joash wa seven year old when he began to reign and he reign
forti year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa zibiah of
beersheba

24:2 and joash did that which wa right in the sight of the lord all
the day of jehoiada the priest

24:3 and jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat son and
daughter

24:4 and it came to pass after thi that joash wa mind to repair
the hous of the lord

24:5 and he gather togeth the priest and the levit and said to

out of jerusalem the collect accord to the command of mose
the servant of the lord and of the congreg of israel for the
tabernacl of witness? 24:7 for the son of athaliah that wick
woman had broken up the hous of god; and also all the dedic
thing of the hous of the lord did they bestow upon baalim

24:8 and at the king command they made a chest and set it
without at the gate of the hous of the lord

24:9 and they made a proclam through judah and jerusalem to
bring in to the lord the collect that mose the servant of god laid
upon israel in the wilder

24:10 and all the princ and all the peopl rejoic and brought in
and cast into the chest until they had made an end

24:11 now it came to pass that at what time the chest wa brought
unto the king offic by the hand of the levit and when they saw
that there wa much money the king scribe and the high priest
offic came and empti the chest and took it and carri it to hi
place again thu they did day by day and gather money in
abund

24:12 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
servic of the hous of the lord and hire mason and carpent to
repair the hous of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass
to mend the hous of the lord

24:13 so the workmen wrought and the work wa perfect by them and
they set the hous of god in hi state and strengthen it

24:14 and when they had finish it they brought the rest of the
money befor the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessel for the
hous of the lord even vessel to minist and to offer withal and
spoon and vessel of gold and silver and they offer burnt
offer in the hous of the lord continu all the day of
jehoiada

24:15 but jehoiada wax old and wa full of day when he died; an
hundr and thirti year old wa he when he die

24:16 and they buri him in the citi of david among the king
becaus he had done good in israel both toward god and toward hi
hous

24:17 now after the death of jehoiada came the princ of judah and
made obeis to the king then the king hearken unto them

24:18 and they left the hous of the lord god of their father and
serv grove and idols: and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for
thi their trespass

24:19 yet he sent prophet to them to bring them again unto the lord;
and they testifi against them: but they would not give ear

24:20 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada
the priest which stood abov the peopl and said unto them thu
saith god whi transgress ye the command of the lord that ye
cannot prosper? becaus ye have forsaken the lord he hath also
forsaken you

24:21 and they conspir against him and stone him with stone at
the command of the king in the court of the hous of the lord

24:22 thu joash the king rememb not the kind which jehoiada
hi father had done to him but slew hi son and when he die he
said the lord look upon it and requir it

24:23 and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of
syria came up against him: and they came to judah and jerusalem and
destroy all the princ of the peopl from among the peopl and
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascu

24:24 for the armi of the syrian came with a small compani of men
and the lord deliv a veri great host into their hand becaus they
had forsaken the lord god of their father so they execut judgment
against joash

24:25 and when they were depart from him (for they left him in
great diseases) hi own servant conspir against him for the blood
of the son of jehoiada the priest and slew him on hi bed and he
died: and they buri him in the citi of david but they buri him
not in the sepulchr of the king

24:26 and these are they that conspir against him; zabad the son of
shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess

24:27 now concern hi son and the great of the burden laid
upon him and the repair of the hous of god behold they are
written in the stori of the book of the king and amaziah hi son
reign in hi stead

25:1 amaziah wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign and
he reign twenti and nine year in jerusalem and hi mother name
wa jehoaddan of jerusalem

25:2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord but not
with a perfect heart

25:3 now it came to pass when the kingdom wa establish to him
that he slew hi servant that had kill the king hi father

25:4 but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the
law in the book of mose where the lord command say the
father shall not die for the children neither shall the children die
for the father but everi man shall die for hi own sin

25:5 moreov amaziah gather judah togeth and made them captain
over thousand and captain over hundr accord to the hous of
their father throughout all judah and benjamin: and he number them
from twenti year old and abov and found them three hundr thousand
choic men abl to go forth to war that could handl spear and
shield

25:6 he hire also an hundr thousand mighti men of valour out of
israel for an hundr talent of silver

25:7 but there came a man of god to him say o king let not the
armi of israel go with thee; for the lord is not with israel to wit
with all the children of ephraim

25:8 but if thou wilt go do it; be strong for the battle: god shall
make thee fall befor the enemy: for god hath power to help and to
cast down

25:9 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the
hundr talent which i have given to the armi of israel? and the man
of god answer the lord is abl to give thee much more than thi

25:10 then amaziah separ them to wit the armi that wa come to
him out of ephraim to go home again: wherefor their anger wa
greatli kindl against judah and they return home in great anger

25:11 and amaziah strengthen himself and led forth hi peopl and
went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten
thousand

25:12 and other ten thousand left aliv did the children of judah
carri away captiv and brought them unto the top of the rock and
cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in
piec

25:13 but the soldier of the armi which amaziah sent back that they
should not go with him to battl fell upon the citi of judah from
samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and
took much spoil

25:14 now it came to pass after that amaziah wa come from the
slaughter of the edomit that he brought the god of the children of
seir and set them up to be hi god and bow down himself befor
them and burn incens unto them

25:15 wherefor the anger of the lord wa kindl against amaziah and
he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him whi hast thou sought
after the god of the peopl which could not deliv their own peopl
out of thine hand? 25:16 and it came to pass as he talk with him
that the king said unto him art thou made of the king counsel?
forbear; whi shouldest thou be smitten? then the prophet forbar and
said i know that god hath determin to destroy thee becaus thou
hast done thi and hast not hearken unto my counsel

25:17 then amaziah king of judah took advic and sent to joash the
son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel say come let us
see one anoth in the face

25:18 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah say
the thistl that wa in lebanon sent to the cedar that wa in lebanon
say give thi daughter to my son to wife: and there pass by a
wild beast that wa in lebanon and trode down the thistl

25:19 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites; and thine heart
lifteth thee up to boast: abid now at home; whi shouldest thou meddl
to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with
thee? 25:20 but amaziah would not hear; for it came of god that he
might deliv them into the hand of their enemi becaus they sought
after the god of edom

25:21 so joash the king of israel went up; and they saw one anoth in
the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which
belongeth to judah

25:22 and judah wa put to the wors befor israel and they fled
everi man to hi tent

25:23 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son
of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to
jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of
ephraim to the corner gate four hundr cubit

25:24 and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessel
that were found in the hous of god with obededom and the treasur
of the king hous the hostag also and return to samaria

25:25 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah live after the death
of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen year

25:26 now the rest of the act of amaziah first and last behold are
they not written in the book of the king of judah and israel? 25:27
now after the time that amaziah did turn away from follow the lord
they made a conspiraci against him in jerusalem; and he fled to
lachish: but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there

25:28 and they brought him upon hors and buri him with hi
father in the citi of judah

26:1 then all the peopl of judah took uzziah who wa sixteen year
old and made him king in the room of hi father amaziah

26:2 he built eloth and restor it to judah after that the king
slept with hi father

26:3 sixteen year old wa uzziah when he began to reign and he

and built citi about ashdod and among the philistin

26:7 and god help him against the philistin and against the
arabian that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunim

26:8 and the ammonit gave gift to uzziah: and hi name spread
abroad even to the enter in of egypt; for he strengthen himself
exceedingli

26:9 moreov uzziah built tower in jerusalem at the corner gate and
at the valley gate and at the turn of the wall and fortifi
them

26:10 also he built tower in the desert and dig mani wells: for
he had much cattl both in the low countri and in the plains:
husbandmen also and vine dresser in the mountain and in carmel:
for he love husbandri

26:11 moreov uzziah had an host of fight men that went out to
war by band accord to the number of their account by the hand of
jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah
one of the king captain

26:12 the whole number of the chief of the father of the mighti men
of valour were two thousand and six hundr

26:13 and under their hand wa an armi three hundr thousand and
seven thousand and five hundr that made war with mighti power to

26:14 and uzziah prepar for them throughout all the host shield

26:15 and he made in jerusalem engin invent by cun men to be
on the tower and upon the bulwark to shoot arrow and great stone

and hi name spread far abroad; for he wa marvel help till
he wa strong

26:16 but when he wa strong hi heart wa lift up to hi
destruction: for he transgress against the lord hi god and went
into the templ of the lord to burn incens upon the altar of incens

26:17 and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscor
priest of the lord that were valiant men: 26:18 and they withstood
uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee
uzziah to burn incens unto the lord but to the priest the son of
aaron that are consecr to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary;
for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from
the lord god

26:19 then uzziah wa wroth and had a censer in hi hand to burn
incense: and while he wa wroth with the priest the leprosi even
rose up in hi forehead befor the priest in the hous of the lord
from besid the incens altar

26:20 and azariah the chief priest and all the priest look upon
him and behold he wa leprou in hi forehead and they thrust him
out from thence; yea himself hast also to go out becaus the lord
had smitten him

26:21 and uzziah the king wa a leper unto the day of hi death and
dwelt in a sever hous be a leper; for he wa cut off from the
hous of the lord: and jotham hi son wa over the king hous
judg the peopl of the land

26:22 now the rest of the act of uzziah first and last did isaiah
the prophet the son of amoz write

26:23 so uzziah slept with hi father and they buri him with hi
father in the field of the burial which belong to the kings; for
they said he is a leper: and jotham hi son reign in hi stead

27:1 jotham wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign and
he reign sixteen year in jerusalem hi mother name also wa

27:2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord

27:3 he built the high gate of the hous of the lord and on the wall

hundr talent of silver and ten thousand measur of wheat and ten
thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him
both the second year and the third

27:6 so jotham becam mighti becaus he prepar hi way befor the
lord hi god

27:7 now the rest of the act of jotham and all hi war and hi
way lo they are written in the book of the king of israel and
judah

27:8 he wa five and twenti year old when he began to reign and
reign sixteen year in jerusalem

27:9 and jotham slept with hi father and they buri him in the
citi of david: and ahaz hi son reign in hi stead

28:1 ahaz wa twenti year old when he began to reign and he reign
sixteen year in jerusalem: but he did not that which wa right in the
sight of the lord like david hi father: 28:2 for he walk in the
way of the king of israel and made also molten imag for baalim

28:3 moreov he burnt incens in the valley of the son of hinnom and
burnt hi children in the fire after the abomin of the heathen
whom the lord had cast out befor the children of israel

28:4 he sacrif also and burnt incens in the high place and on
the hill and under everi green tree

28:5 wherefor the lord hi god deliv him into the hand of the
king of syria; and they smote him and carri away a great multitud
of them captiv and brought them to damascu and he wa also
deliv into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a
great slaughter

28:6 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundr and twenti
thousand in one day which were all valiant men; becaus they had
forsaken the lord god of their father

28:7 and zichri a mighti man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king
son and azrikam the governor of the hous and elkanah that wa next
to the king

28:8 and the children of israel carri away captiv of their brethren
two hundr thousand women son and daughter and took also away
much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria

28:9 but a prophet of the lord wa there whose name wa oded: and he
went out befor the host that came to samaria and said unto them
behold becaus the lord god of your father wa wroth with judah he
hath deliv them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage
that reacheth up unto heaven

28:10 and now ye purpos to keep under the children of judah and
jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with
you even with you sin against the lord your god? 28:11 now hear me
therefor and deliv the captiv again which ye have taken captiv
of your brethren: for the fierc wrath of the lord is upon you

28:12 then certain of the head of the children of ephraim azariah
the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah
the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them
that came from the war 28:13 and said unto them ye shall not bring
in the captiv hither: for wherea we have offend against the lord
alreadi ye intend to add more to our sin and to our trespass: for
our trespass is great and there is fierc wrath against israel

28:14 so the arm men left the captiv and the spoil befor the
princ and all the congreg

28:15 and the men which were express by name rose up and took the
captiv and with the spoil cloth all that were nake among them
and array them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink
and anoint them and carri all the feebl of them upon ass and
brought them to jericho the citi of palm tree to their brethren:
then they return to samaria

28:16 at that time did king ahaz send unto the king of assyria to
help him

28:17 for again the edomit had come and smitten judah and carri
away captiv

28:18 the philistin also had invad the citi of the low countri
and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and
gederoth and shocho with the villag thereof and timnah with the
villag thereof gimzo also and the villag thereof: and they dwelt
there

28:19 for the lord brought judah low becaus of ahaz king of israel;
for he made judah nake and transgress sore against the lord

28:20 and tilgathpilnes king of assyria came unto him and
distress him but strengthen him not

28:21 for ahaz took away a portion out of the hous of the lord and
out of the hous of the king and of the princ and gave it unto the
king of assyria: but he help him not

28:22 and in the time of hi distress did he trespass yet more against
the lord: thi is that king ahaz

28:23 for he sacrif unto the god of damascu which smote him:
and he said becaus the god of the king of syria help them
therefor will i sacrific to them that they may help me but they
were the ruin of him and of all israel

28:24 and ahaz gather togeth the vessel of the hous of god and
cut in piec the vessel of the hous of god and shut up the door
of the hous of the lord and he made him altar in everi corner of
jerusalem

28:25 and in everi sever citi of judah he made high place to burn
incens unto other god and provok to anger the lord god of hi
father

28:26 now the rest of hi act and of all hi way first and last
behold they are written in the book of the king of judah and israel

28:27 and ahaz slept with hi father and they buri him in the
citi even in jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchr
of the king of israel: and hezekiah hi son reign in hi stead

29:1 hezekiah began to reign when he wa five and twenti year old
and he reign nine and twenti year in jerusalem and hi mother
name wa abijah the daughter of zechariah

29:2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord
accord to all that david hi father had done

29:3 he in the first year of hi reign in the first month open the
door of the hous of the lord and repair them

29:4 and he brought in the priest and the levit and gather them
togeth into the east street 29:5 and said unto them hear me ye
levit sanctifi now yourselv and sanctifi the hous of the lord
god of your father and carri forth the filthi out of the holi
place

29:6 for our father have trespass and done that which wa evil in
the eye of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turn
away their face from the habit of the lord and turn their
back

29:7 also they have shut up the door of the porch and put out the
lamp and have not burn incens nor offer burnt offer in the
holi place unto the god of israel

29:8 wherefor the wrath of the lord wa upon judah and jerusalem and
he hath deliv them to troubl to astonish and to hiss as
ye see with your eye

29:9 for lo our father have fallen by the sword and our son and
our daughter and our wive are in captiv for thi

29:10 now it is in mine heart to make a coven with the lord god of
israel that hi fierc wrath may turn away from us

29:11 my son be not now negligent: for the lord hath chosen you to
stand befor him to serv him and that ye should minist unto him
and burn incens

29:12 then the levit aros mahath the son of amasai and joel the
son of azariah of the son of the kohathites: and of the son of
merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel: and of
the gershonites; joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah:
29:13 and of the son of elizaphan; shimri and jeiel: and of the son
of asaph; zechariah and mattaniah: 29:14 and of the son of heman;
jehiel and shimei: and of the son of jeduthun; shemaiah and uzziel

29:15 and they gather their brethren and sanctifi themselv and
came accord to the command of the king by the word of the
lord to cleans the hous of the lord

29:16 and the priest went into the inner part of the hous of the
lord to cleans it and brought out all the unclean that they
found in the templ of the lord into the court of the hous of the
lord and the levit took it to carri it out abroad into the brook
kidron

29:17 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctifi
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord:
so they sanctifi the hous of the lord in eight days; and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end

29:18 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have
cleans all the hous of the lord and the altar of burnt offer
with all the vessel thereof and the shewbread tabl with all the
vessel thereof

29:19 moreov all the vessel which king ahaz in hi reign did cast
away in hi transgress have we prepar and sanctifi and
behold they are befor the altar of the lord

29:20 then hezekiah the king rose earli and gather the ruler of
the citi and went up to the hous of the lord

29:21 and they brought seven bullock and seven ram and seven
lamb and seven he goat for a sin offer for the kingdom and for
the sanctuari and for judah and he command the priest the son of
aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord

29:22 so they kill the bullock and the priest receiv the blood
and sprinkl it on the altar: likewis when they had kill the
ram they sprinkl the blood upon the altar: they kill also the
lamb and they sprinkl the blood upon the altar

29:23 and they brought forth the he goat for the sin offer befor
the king and the congregation; and they laid their hand upon them:
29:24 and the priest kill them and they made reconcili with
their blood upon the altar to make an aton for all israel: for
the king command that the burnt offer and the sin offer should
be made for all israel

29:25 and he set the levit in the hous of the lord with cymbal
with psalteri and with harp accord to the command of
david and of gad the king seer and nathan the prophet: for so wa
the command of the lord by hi prophet

29:26 and the levit stood with the instrument of david and the
priest with the trumpet

29:27 and hezekiah command to offer the burnt offer upon the
altar

and when the burnt offer began the song of the lord began also
with the trumpet and with the instrument ordain by david king of
israel

29:28 and all the congreg worship and the singer sang and
the trumpet sounded: and all thi continu until the burnt
offer wa finish

29:29 and when they had made an end of offer the king and all that
were present with him bow themselv and worship

29:30 moreov hezekiah the king and the princ command the levit
to sing prais unto the lord with the word of david and of asaph the
seer and they sang prais with glad and they bow their head
and worship

29:31 then hezekiah answer and said now ye have consecr
yourselv unto the lord come near and bring sacrific and thank
offer into the hous of the lord and the congreg brought in
sacrific and thank offerings; and as mani as were of a free heart
burnt offer

29:32 and the number of the burnt offer which the congreg
brought wa threescor and ten bullock an hundr ram and two
hundr lambs: all these were for a burnt offer to the lord

29:33 and the consecr thing were six hundr oxen and three
thousand sheep

29:34 but the priest were too few so that they could not flay all
the burnt offerings: wherefor their brethren the levit did help
them till the work wa end and until the other priest had
sanctifi themselves: for the levit were more upright in heart to
sanctifi themselv than the priest

29:35 and also the burnt offer were in abund with the fat of
the peac offer and the drink offer for everi burnt offer
so the servic of the hous of the lord wa set in order

29:36 and hezekiah rejoic and all the peopl that god had prepar
the people: for the thing wa done suddenli

30:1 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letter also
to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the hous of the
lord at jerusalem to keep the passov unto the lord god of israel

30:2 for the king had taken counsel and hi princ and all the
congreg in jerusalem to keep the passov in the second month

30:3 for they could not keep it at that time becaus the priest had
not sanctifi themselv suffici neither had the peopl
gather themselv togeth to jerusalem

30:4 and the thing pleas the king and all the congreg

30:5 so they establish a decre to make proclam throughout all
israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the
passov unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem: for they had not
done it of a long time in such sort as it wa written

30:6 so the post went with the letter from the king and hi princ
throughout all israel and judah and accord to the command of
the king say ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god
of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of
you that are escap out of the hand of the king of assyria

30:7 and be not ye like your father and like your brethren which
trespass against the lord god of their father who therefor gave
them up to desol as ye see

30:8 now be ye not stiffneck as your father were but yield
yourselv unto the lord and enter into hi sanctuari which he hath
sanctifi for ever: and serv the lord your god that the fierc
of hi wrath may turn away from you

30:9 for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your
children shall find compass befor them that lead them captiv so
that they shall come again into thi land: for the lord your god is
graciou and merci and will not turn away hi face from you if ye
return unto him

30:10 so the post pass from citi to citi through the countri of
ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun: but they laugh them to
scorn and mock them

30:11 nevertheless diver of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbl
themselv and came to jerusalem

30:12 also in judah the hand of god wa to give them one heart to do
the command of the king and of the princ by the word of the
lord

30:13 and there assembl at jerusalem much peopl to keep the feast
of unleaven bread in the second month a veri great congreg

30:14 and they aros and took away the altar that were in jerusalem
and all the altar for incens took they away and cast them into the
brook kidron

30:15 then they kill the passov on the fourteenth day of the
second month: and the priest and the levit were asham and
sanctifi themselv and brought in the burnt offer into the
hous of the lord

30:16 and they stood in their place after their manner accord to
the law of mose the man of god: the priest sprinkl the blood
which they receiv of the hand of the levit

30:17 for there were mani in the congreg that were not
sanctified: therefor the levit had the charg of the kill of the
passov for everi one that wa not clean to sanctifi them unto the
lord

30:18 for a multitud of the peopl even mani of ephraim and
manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleans themselv yet did
they eat the passov otherwis than it wa written but hezekiah
pray for them say the good lord pardon everi one 30:19 that
prepareth hi heart to seek god the lord god of hi father though

31:1 now when all thi wa finish all israel that were present went

31:20 and thu did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that
which wa good and right and truth befor the lord hi god

31:21 and in everi work that he began in the servic of the hous of
god and in the law and in the command to seek hi god he did
it with all hi heart and prosper

32:1 after these thing and the establish thereof sennacherib
king of assyria came and enter into judah and encamp against the
fenc citi and thought to win them for himself

32:2 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib wa come and that he wa
purpos to fight against jerusalem 32:3 he took counsel with hi
princ and hi mighti men to stop the water of the fountain which
were without the city: and they did help him

32:4 so there wa gather much peopl togeth who stop all the
fountain and the brook that ran through the midst of the land
say whi should the king of assyria come and find much water?
32:5 also he strengthen himself and built up all the wall that wa
broken and rais it up to the tower and anoth wall without and
repair millo in the citi of david and made dart and shield in
abund

32:6 and he set captain of war over the peopl and gather them
togeth to him in the street of the gate of the citi and spake
comfort to them say 32:7 be strong and courag be not
afraid nor dismay for the king of assyria nor for all the multitud
that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: 32:8 with
him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the lord our god to help us
and to fight our battl and the peopl rest themselv upon the
word of hezekiah king of judah

32:9 after thi did sennacherib king of assyria send hi servant to
jerusalem (but he himself laid sieg against lachish and all hi
power with him) unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that
were at jerusalem say 32:10 thu saith sennacherib king of
assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abid in the sieg in jerusalem?
32:11 doth not hezekiah persuad you to give over yourselv to die by
famin and by thirst say the lord our god shall deliv us out of
the hand of the king of assyria? 32:12 hath not the same hezekiah
taken away hi high place and hi altar and command judah and
jerusalem say ye shall worship befor one altar and burn incens
upon it? 32:13 know ye not what i and my father have done unto all
the peopl of other lands? were the god of the nation of those land
ani way abl to deliv their land out of mine hand? 32:14 who wa
there among all the god of those nation that my father utterli
destroy that could deliv hi peopl out of mine hand that your
god should be abl to deliv you out of mine hand? 32:15 now
therefor let not hezekiah deceiv you nor persuad you on thi
manner neither yet believ him: for no god of ani nation or kingdom
wa abl to deliv hi peopl out of mine hand and out of the hand
of my fathers: how much less shall your god deliv you out of mine
hand? 32:16 and hi servant spake yet more against the lord god and
against hi servant hezekiah

32:17 he wrote also letter to rail on the lord god of israel and to
speak against him say as the god of the nation of other land
have not deliv their peopl out of mine hand so shall not the god
of hezekiah deliv hi peopl out of mine hand

32:18 then they cri with a loud voic in the jew speech unto the
peopl of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to
troubl them; that they might take the citi

32:19 and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the god
of the peopl of the earth which were the work of the hand of man

32:20 and for thi caus hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the
son of amoz pray and cri to heaven

32:21 and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighti men of
valour and the leader and captain in the camp of the king of
assyria so he return with shame of face to hi own land and when
he wa come into the hous of hi god they that came forth of hi own
bowel slew him there with the sword

32:22 thu the lord save hezekiah and the inhabit of jerusalem
from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of
all other and guid them on everi side

32:23 and mani brought gift unto the lord to jerusalem and present
to hezekiah king of judah: so that he wa magnifi in the sight of
all nation from thenceforth

32:24 in those day hezekiah wa sick to the death and pray unto
the lord: and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign

32:25 but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit done
unto him; for hi heart wa lift up: therefor there wa wrath upon
him and upon judah and jerusalem

32:26 notwithstand hezekiah humbl himself for the pride of hi
heart both he and the inhabit of jerusalem so that the wrath of
the lord came not upon them in the day of hezekiah

32:27 and hezekiah had exceed much rich and honour: and he made
himself treasuri for silver and for gold and for preciou stone
and for spice and for shield and for all manner of pleasant
jewels; 32:28 storehous also for the increas of corn and wine and
oil; and stall for all manner of beast and cote for flock

32:29 moreov he provid him citi and possess of flock and
herd in abundance: for god had given him substanc veri much

32:30 thi same hezekiah also stop the upper watercours of gihon
and brought it straight down to the west side of the citi of david
and hezekiah prosper in all hi work

32:31 howbeit in the busi of the ambassador of the princ of
babylon who sent unto him to enquir of the wonder that wa done in
the land god left him to tri him that he might know all that wa in
hi heart

32:32 now the rest of the act of hezekiah and hi good behold
they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and in the book of the king of judah and israel

32:33 and hezekiah slept with hi father and they buri him in the
chiefest of the sepulchr of the son of david: and all judah and the
inhabit of jerusalem did him honour at hi death and manasseh hi
son reign in hi stead

33:1 manasseh wa twelv year old when he began to reign and he
reign fifti and five year in jerusalem: 33:2 but did that which wa
evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abomin of the
heathen whom the lord had cast out befor the children of israel

33:3 for he built again the high place which hezekiah hi father had
broken down and he rear up altar for baalim and made grove and
worship all the host of heaven and serv them

33:4 also he built altar in the hous of the lord whereof the lord
had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever

33:5 and he built altar for all the host of heaven in the two court
of the hous of the lord

33:6 and he caus hi children to pass through the fire in the valley
of the son of hinnom: also he observ time and use enchant
and use witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with
wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provok him
to anger

33:7 and he set a carv imag the idol which he had made in the
hous of god of which god had said to david and to solomon hi son
in thi hous and in jerusalem which i have chosen befor all the
tribe of israel will i put my name for ever: 33:8 neither will i ani
more remov the foot of israel from out of the land which i have
appoint for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that
i have command them accord to the whole law and the statut and
the ordin by the hand of mose

33:9 so manasseh made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to err
and to do wors than the heathen whom the lord had destroy befor
the children of israel

33:10 and the lord spake to manasseh and to hi people: but they
would not hearken

33:11 wherefor the lord brought upon them the captain of the host of
the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorn and bound
him with fetter and carri him to babylon

33:12 and when he wa in afflict he besought the lord hi god and
humbl himself greatli befor the god of hi father 33:13 and
pray unto him: and he wa intreat of him and heard hi
supplic and brought him again to jerusalem into hi kingdom
then manasseh knew that the lord he wa god

33:14 now after thi he built a wall without the citi of david on the
west side of gihon in the valley even to the enter in at the fish
gate and compass about ophel and rais it up a veri great height
and put captain of war in all the fenc citi of judah

33:15 and he took away the strang god and the idol out of the hous
of the lord and all the altar that he had built in the mount of the
hous of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the citi

33:16 and he repair the altar of the lord and sacrif thereon
peac offer and thank offer and command judah to serv the
lord god of israel

33:17 nevertheless the peopl did sacrific still in the high place
yet unto the lord their god onli

33:18 now the rest of the act of manasseh and hi prayer unto hi
god and the word of the seer that spake to him in the name of the
lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the king
of israel

33:19 hi prayer also and how god wa intreat of him and all hi
sin and hi trespass and the place wherein he built high place
and set up grove and graven imag befor he wa humbled: behold
they are written among the say of the seer

33:20 so manasseh slept with hi father and they buri him in hi
own house: and amon hi son reign in hi stead

33:21 amon wa two and twenti year old when he began to reign and
reign two year in jerusalem

33:22 but he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord as did
manasseh hi father: for amon sacrif unto all the carv imag
which manasseh hi father had made and serv them; 33:23 and humbl
not himself befor the lord as manasseh hi father had humbl
himself; but amon trespass more and more

33:24 and hi servant conspir against him and slew him in hi own
hous

33:25 but the peopl of the land slew all them that had conspir
against king amon; and the peopl of the land made josiah hi son king
in hi stead

34:1 josiah wa eight year old when he began to reign and he reign
in jerusalem one and thirti year

34:2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord and
walk in the way of david hi father and declin neither to the
right hand nor to the left

34:3 for in the eighth year of hi reign while he wa yet young he
began to seek after the god of david hi father: and in the twelfth
year he began to purg judah and jerusalem from the high place and
the grove and the carv imag and the molten imag

34:4 and they brake down the altar of baalim in hi presence; and the
imag that were on high abov them he cut down; and the grove and
the carv imag and the molten imag he brake in piec and made
dust of them and strow it upon the grave of them that had
sacrif unto them

34:5 and he burnt the bone of the priest upon their altar and
cleans judah and jerusalem

34:6 and so did he in the citi of manasseh and ephraim and simeon
even unto naphtali with their mattock round about

34:7 and when he had broken down the altar and the grove and had
beaten the graven imag into powder and cut down all the idol
throughout all the land of israel he return to jerusalem

34:8 now in the eighteenth year of hi reign when he had purg the
land and the hous he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah
the governor of the citi and joah the son of joahaz the record to
repair the hous of the lord hi god

34:9 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they deliv the
money that wa brought into the hous of god which the levit that
kept the door had gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and
of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin; and they
return to jerusalem

34:10 and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the hous of the lord and they gave it to the workmen
that wrought in the hous of the lord to repair and amend the house:
34:11 even to the artific and builder gave they it to buy hewn
stone and timber for coupl and to floor the hous which the
king of judah had destroy

34:12 and the men did the work faithfully: and the overs of them
were jahath and obadiah the levit of the son of merari; and
zechariah and meshullam of the son of the kohathit to set it
forward; and other of the levit all that could skill of instrument
of musick

34:13 also they were over the bearer of burden and were overs
of all that wrought the work in ani manner of service: and of the
levit there were scribe and offic and porter

34:14 and when they brought out the money that wa brought into the
hous of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the
lord given by mose

34:15 and hilkiah answer and said to shaphan the scribe i have
found the book of the law in the hous of the lord and hilkiah
deliv the book to shaphan

34:16 and shaphan carri the book to the king and brought the king
word back again say all that wa commit to thi servant they
do it

34:17 and they have gather togeth the money that wa found in the
hous of the lord and have deliv it into the hand of the
overs and to the hand of the workmen

34:18 then shaphan the scribe told the king say hilkiah the
priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it befor the king

34:19 and it came to pass when the king had heard the word of the
law that he rent hi cloth

34:20 and the king command hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan
and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a
servant of the king say 34:21 go enquir of the lord for me
and for them that are left in israel and in judah concern the
word of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the lord
that is pour out upon us becaus our father have not kept the word
of the lord to do after all that is written in thi book

34:22 and hilkiah and they that the king had appoint went to
huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son
of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in jerusalem in the
college:) and they spake to her to that effect

34:23 and she answer them thu saith the lord god of israel tell
ye the man that sent you to me 34:24 thu saith the lord behold i
will bring evil upon thi place and upon the inhabit thereof
even all the curs that are written in the book which they have read
befor the king of judah: 34:25 becaus they have forsaken me and
have burn incens unto other god that they might provok me to
anger with all the work of their hands; therefor my wrath shall be
pour out upon thi place and shall not be quench

34:26 and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquir of the
lord so shall ye say unto him thu saith the lord god of israel
concern the word which thou hast heard; 34:27 becaus thine heart
wa tender and thou didst humbl thyself befor god when thou
heardest hi word against thi place and against the inhabit
thereof and humbledst thyself befor me and didst rend thi cloth
and weep befor me; i have even heard thee also saith the lord

34:28 behold i will gather thee to thi father and thou shalt be
gather to thi grave in peac neither shall thine eye see all the
evil that i will bring upon thi place and upon the inhabit of
the same so they brought the king word again

34:29 then the king sent and gather togeth all the elder of judah
and jerusalem

34:30 and the king went up into the hous of the lord and all the men
of judah and the inhabit of jerusalem and the priest and the
levit and all the peopl great and small: and he read in their
ear all the word of the book of the coven that wa found in the
hous of the lord

34:31 and the king stood in hi place and made a coven befor the
lord to walk after the lord and to keep hi command and hi
testimoni and hi statut with all hi heart and with all hi
soul to perform the word of the coven which are written in thi
book

34:32 and he caus all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to
stand to it and the inhabit of jerusalem did accord to the
coven of god the god of their father

34:33 and josiah took away all the abomin out of all the
countri that pertain to the children of israel and made all that
were present in israel to serv even to serv the lord their god and
all hi day they depart not from follow the lord the god of
their father

35:1 moreov josiah kept a passov unto the lord in jerusalem: and
they kill the passov on the fourteenth day of the first month

35:2 and he set the priest in their charg and encourag them to
the servic of the hous of the lord 35:3 and said unto the levit
that taught all israel which were holi unto the lord put the holi
ark in the hous which solomon the son of david king of israel did
build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serv now the
lord your god and hi peopl israel 35:4 and prepar yourselv by
the hous of your father after your cours accord to the
write of david king of israel and accord to the write of
solomon hi son

35:5 and stand in the holi place accord to the divis of the
famili of the father of your brethren the peopl and after the
divis of the famili of the levit

35:6 so kill the passov and sanctifi yourselv and prepar your
brethren that they may do accord to the word of the lord by the
hand of mose

35:7 and josiah gave to the peopl of the flock lamb and kid all
for the passov offer for all that were present to the number
of thirti thousand and three thousand bullocks: these were of the
king substanc

35:8 and hi princ gave willingli unto the peopl to the priest
and to the levites: hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel ruler of the
hous of god gave unto the priest for the passov offer two
thousand and six hundr small cattl and three hundr oxen

35:9 conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel hi brethren and
hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levit gave unto the
levit for passov offer five thousand small cattl and five
hundr oxen

35:10 so the servic wa prepar and the priest stood in their
place and the levit in their cours accord to the king
command

35:11 and they kill the passov and the priest sprinkl the
blood from their hand and the levit flay them

35:12 and they remov the burnt offer that they might give
accord to the divis of the famili of the peopl to offer
unto the lord as it is written in the book of mose and so did they
with the oxen

35:13 and they roast the passov with fire accord to the
ordinance: but the other holi offer sod they in pot and in
caldron and in pan and divid them speedili among all the peopl

35:14 and afterward they made readi for themselv and for the
priests: becaus the priest the son of aaron were busi in offer
of burnt offer and the fat until night; therefor the levit
prepar for themselv and for the priest the son of aaron

35:15 and the singer the son of asaph were in their place accord
to the command of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the
king seer; and the porter wait at everi gate; they might not
depart from their service; for their brethren the levit prepar for
them

35:16 so all the servic of the lord wa prepar the same day to
keep the passov and to offer burnt offer upon the altar of the
lord accord to the command of king josiah

35:17 and the children of israel that were present kept the passov
at that time and the feast of unleaven bread seven day

35:18 and there wa no passov like to that kept in israel from the
day of samuel the prophet; neither did all the king of israel keep
such a passov as josiah kept and the priest and the levit and
all judah and israel that were present and the inhabit of
jerusalem

35:19 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah wa thi passov
kept

35:20 after all thi when josiah had prepar the templ necho king
of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates: and josiah
went out against him

35:21 but he sent ambassador to him say what have i to do with
thee thou king of judah? i come not against thee thi day but
against the hous wherewith i have war: for god command me to make
haste: forbear thee from meddl with god who is with me that he
destroy thee not

35:22 nevertheless josiah would not turn hi face from him but
disguis himself that he might fight with him and hearken not
unto the word of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in
the valley of megiddo

35:23 and the archer shot at king josiah; and the king said to hi
servant have me away; for i am sore wound

35:24 hi servant therefor took him out of that chariot and put him
in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to jerusalem
and he die and wa buri in one of the sepulchr of hi father
and all judah and jerusalem mourn for josiah

35:25 and jeremiah lament for josiah: and all the sing men and
the sing women spake of josiah in their lament to thi day
and made them an ordin in israel: and behold they are written in
the lament

35:26 now the rest of the act of josiah and hi good accord
to that which wa written in the law of the lord 35:27 and hi deed
first and last behold they are written in the book of the king of
israel and judah

36:1 then the peopl of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and
made him king in hi father stead in jerusalem

36:2 jehoahaz wa twenti and three year old when he began to reign
and he reign three month in jerusalem

36:3 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemn
the land in an hundr talent of silver and a talent of gold

36:4 and the king of egypt made eliakim hi brother king over judah
and jerusalem and turn hi name to jehoiakim and necho took
jehoahaz hi brother and carri him to egypt

36:5 jehoiakim wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign
and he reign eleven year in jerusalem: and he did that which wa
evil in the sight of the lord hi god

36:6 against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him
in fetter to carri him to babylon

36:7 nebuchadnezzar also carri of the vessel of the hous of the
lord to babylon and put them in hi templ at babylon

36:8 now the rest of the act of jehoiakim and hi abomin which
he did and that which wa found in him behold they are written in
the book of the king of israel and judah: and jehoiachin hi son
reign in hi stead

36:9 jehoiachin wa eight year old when he began to reign and he
reign three month and ten day in jerusalem: and he did that which
wa evil in the sight of the lord

36:10 and when the year wa expir king nebuchadnezzar sent and
brought him to babylon with the goodli vessel of the hous of the
lord and made zedekiah hi brother king over judah and jerusalem

36:11 zedekiah wa one and twenti year old when he began to reign
and reign eleven year in jerusalem

36:12 and he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord hi god
and humbl not himself befor jeremiah the prophet speak from the
mouth of the lord

36:13 and he also rebel against king nebuchadnezzar who had made
him swear by god: but he stiffen hi neck and harden hi heart
from turn unto the lord god of israel

36:14 moreov all the chief of the priest and the peopl
transgress veri much after all the abomin of the heathen; and
pollut the hous of the lord which he had hallow in jerusalem

36:15 and the lord god of their father sent to them by hi
messeng rise up betim and sending; becaus he had compass
on hi peopl and on hi dwell place: 36:16 but they mock the
messeng of god and despis hi word and misus hi prophet
until the wrath of the lord aros against hi peopl till there wa

8:21 then i proclaim a fast there at the river of ahava that we

us and for our littl one and for all our substanc

8:22 for i wa asham to requir of the king a band of soldier and
horsemen to help us against the enemi in the way: becaus we had
spoken unto the king say the hand of our god is upon all them for
good that seek him; but hi power and hi wrath is against all them
that forsak him

8:23 so we fast and besought our god for this: and he wa intreat

8:24 then i separ twelv of the chief of the priest sherebiah
hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them 8:25 and weigh unto

the lord god of your father

8:29 watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them befor the chief of
the priest and the levit and chief of the father of israel at
jerusalem in the chamber of the hous of the lord

8:30 so took the priest and the levit the weight of the silver and
the gold and the vessel to bring them to jerusalem unto the hous
of our god

8:31 then we depart from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of
the first month to go unto jerusalem: and the hand of our god wa
upon us and he deliv us from the hand of the enemi and of such
as lay in wait by the way

8:32 and we came to jerusalem and abod there three day

8:33 now on the fourth day wa the silver and the gold and the vessel
weigh in the hous of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of
uriah the priest; and with him wa eleazar the son of phinehas; and
with them wa jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of
binnui levites; 8:34 by number and by weight of everi one: and all

8:36 and they deliv the king commiss unto the king
lieuten and to the governor on thi side the river: and they
further the peopl and the hous of god

9:1 now when these thing were done the princ came to me say
the peopl of israel and the priest and the levit have not
separ themselv from the peopl of the land do accord to
their abomin even of the canaanit the hittit the
perizzit the jebusit the ammonit the moabit the egyptian
and the amorit

9:2 for they have taken of their daughter for themselv and for
their sons: so that the holi seed have mingl themselv with the
peopl of those lands: yea the hand of the princ and ruler hath
been chief in thi trespass

9:3 and when i heard thi thing i rent my garment and my mantl and
pluck off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down
astoni

9:4 then were assembl unto me everi one that trembl at the word
of the god of israel becaus of the transgress of those that had
been carri away; and i sat astoni until the even sacrific

9:5 and at the even sacrific i aros up from my heaviness; and
have rent my garment and my mantl i fell upon my knee and spread
out my hand unto the lord my god 9:6 and said o my god i am
asham and blush to lift up my face to thee my god: for our
iniqu are increas over our head and our trespass is grown up
unto the heaven

9:7 sinc the day of our father have we been in a great trespass
unto thi day; and for our iniqu have we our king and our
priest been deliv into the hand of the king of the land to
the sword to captiv and to a spoil and to confus of face as
it is thi day

9:8 and now for a littl space grace hath been shew from the lord
our god to leav us a remnant to escap and to give us a nail in hi
holi place that our god may lighten our eye and give us a littl
reviv in our bondag

9:9 for we were bondmen; yet our god hath not forsaken us in our
bondag but hath extend merci unto us in the sight of the king of
persia to give us a reviv to set up the hous of our god and to
repair the desol thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in
jerusalem

9:10 and now o our god what shall we say after this? for we have
forsaken thi command 9:11 which thou hast command by thi
servant the prophet say the land unto which ye go to possess
it is an unclean land with the filthi of the peopl of the land
with their abomin which have fill it from one end to anoth

9:12 now therefor give not your daughter unto their son neither
take their daughter unto your son nor seek their peac or their
wealth for ever: that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land
and leav it for an inherit to your children for ever

9:13 and after all that is come upon us for our evil deed and for
our great trespass see that thou our god hast punish us less
than our iniqu deserv and hast given us such deliver as
this; 9:14 should we again break thi command and join in
affin with the peopl of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
angri with us till thou hadst consum us so that there should be no
remnant nor escaping? 9:15 o lord god of israel thou art righteous:
for we remain yet escap as it is thi day: behold we are befor
thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand befor thee becaus of
thi

10:1 now when ezra had pray and when he had confess weep and

for the peopl wept veri sore

10:2 and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the son of elam

10:5 then aros ezra and made the chief priest the levit and all

togeth unto jerusalem; 10:8 and that whosoev would not come within

4:2 and he spake befor hi brethren and the armi of samaria and
said what do these feebl jews? will they fortifi themselves? will
they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they reviv the
stone out of the heap of the rubbish which are burned? 4:3 now
tobiah the ammonit wa by him and he said even that which they
build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall

4:4 hear o our god; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 4:5
and cover not their iniqu and let not their sin be blot out
from befor thee: for they have provok thee to anger befor the
builder

4:6 so built we the wall; and all the wall wa join togeth unto
the half thereof: for the peopl had a mind to work

4:7 but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the
arabian and the ammonit and the ashdodit heard that the wall
of jerusalem were made up and that the breach began to be stop
then they were veri wroth 4:8 and conspir all of them togeth to
come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it

4:9 nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch
against them day and night becaus of them

4:10 and judah said the strength of the bearer of burden is
decay and there is much rubbish; so that we are not abl to build
the wall

4:11 and our adversari said they shall not know neither see till
we come in the midst among them and slay them and caus the work to
ceas

4:12 and it came to pass that when the jew which dwelt by them came
they said unto us ten time from all place whenc ye shall return
unto us they will be upon you

4:13 therefor set i in the lower place behind the wall and on the
higher place i even set the peopl after their famili with their
sword their spear and their bow

4:14 and i look and rose up and said unto the nobl and to the
ruler and to the rest of the peopl be not ye afraid of them:
rememb the lord which is great and terribl and fight for your
brethren your son and your daughter your wive and your hous

4:15 and it came to pass when our enemi heard that it wa known
unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we return
all of us to the wall everi one unto hi work

4:16 and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my
servant wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the
spear the shield and the bow and the habergeons; and the ruler
were behind all the hous of judah

4:17 they which build on the wall and they that bare burden with
those that lade everi one with one of hi hand wrought in the work
and with the other hand held a weapon

4:18 for the builder everi one had hi sword gird by hi side and
so build and he that sound the trumpet wa by me

4:19 and i said unto the nobl and to the ruler and to the rest of
the peopl the work is great and larg and we are separ upon the
wall one far from anoth

4:20 in what place therefor ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort
ye thither unto us: our god shall fight for us

4:21 so we labour in the work: and half of them held the spear from
the rise of the morn till the star appear

4:22 likewis at the same time said i unto the peopl let everi one
with hi servant lodg within jerusalem that in the night they may be
a guard to us and labour on the day

4:23 so neither i nor my brethren nor my servant nor the men of
the guard which follow me none of us put off our cloth save
that everi one put them off for wash

5:1 and there wa a great cri of the peopl and of their wive against
their brethren the jew

5:2 for there were that said we our son and our daughter are
many: therefor we take up corn for them that we may eat and live

5:3 some also there were that said we have mortgag our land
vineyard and hous that we might buy corn becaus of the dearth

5:4 there were also that said we have borrow money for the king
tribut and that upon our land and vineyard

5:5 yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as
their children: and lo we bring into bondag our son and our
daughter to be servant and some of our daughter are brought unto
bondag already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other
men have our land and vineyard

5:6 and i wa veri angri when i heard their cri and these word

5:7 then i consult with myself and i rebuk the nobl and the
ruler and said unto them ye exact usuri everi one of hi brother
and i set a great assembl against them

5:8 and i said unto them we after our abil have redeem our
brethren the jew which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even
sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? then held they
their peac and found noth to answer

5:9 also i said it is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our god becaus of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies? 5:10 i likewis and my brethren and my servant might
exact of them money and corn: i pray you let us leav off thi usuri

5:11 restor i pray you to them even thi day their land their
vineyard their oliveyard and their hous also the hundredth part
of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of
them

5:12 then said they we will restor them and will requir noth of
them; so will we do as thou sayest then i call the priest and
took an oath of them that they should do accord to thi promis

5:13 also i shook my lap and said so god shake out everi man from
hi hous and from hi labour that performeth not thi promis even
thu be he shaken out and empti and all the congreg said
amen and prais the lord and the peopl did accord to thi
promis

5:14 moreov from the time that i wa appoint to be their governor
in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of artaxerx the king that is twelv year i and my
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor

5:15 but the former governor that had been befor me were chargeabl
unto the peopl and had taken of them bread and wine besid forti
shekel of silver; yea even their servant bare rule over the people:
but so did not i becaus of the fear of god

5:16 yea also i continu in the work of thi wall neither bought we
ani land: and all my servant were gather thither unto the work

5:17 moreov there were at my tabl an hundr and fifti of the jew
and ruler besid those that came unto us from among the heathen that
are about us

5:18 now that which wa prepar for me daili wa one ox and six
choic sheep; also fowl were prepar for me and onc in ten day
store of all sort of wine: yet for all thi requir not i the bread
of the governor becaus the bondag wa heavi upon thi peopl

5:19 think upon me my god for good accord to all that i have
done for thi peopl

6:1 now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the
arabian and the rest of our enemi heard that i had build the
wall and that there wa no breach left therein; (though at that time
i had not set up the door upon the gates;) 6:2 that sanballat and
geshem sent unto me say come let us meet togeth in some one of
the villag in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief

6:3 and i sent messeng unto them say i am do a great work
so that i cannot come down: whi should the work ceas whilst i leav
it and come down to you? 6:4 yet they sent unto me four time after
thi sort; and i answer them after the same manner

6:5 then sent sanballat hi servant unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in hi hand; 6:6 wherein wa written it is
report among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the
jew think to rebel: for which caus thou buildest the wall that thou
mayest be their king accord to these word

6:7 and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at
jerusalem say there is a king in judah: and now shall it be
report to the king accord to these word come now therefor and
let us take counsel togeth

6:8 then i sent unto him say there are no such thing done as
thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart

6:9 for they all made us afraid say their hand shall be weaken
from the work that it be not done now therefor o god strengthen
my hand

6:10 afterward i came unto the hous of shemaiah the son of delaiah
the son of mehetabeel who wa shut up; and he said let us meet
togeth in the hous of god within the templ and let us shut the
door of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea in the
night will they come to slay thee

6:11 and i said should such a man as i flee? and who is there that
be as i am would go into the templ to save hi life? i will not
go in

6:12 and lo i perceiv that god had not sent him; but that he
pronounc thi propheci against me: for tobiah and sanballat had
hire him

6:13 therefor wa he hire that i should be afraid and do so and
sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they
might reproach me

6:14 my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat accord to these
their work and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the
prophet that would have put me in fear

6:15 so the wall wa finish in the twenti and fifth day of the month
elul in fifti and two day

6:16 and it came to pass that when all our enemi heard thereof and
all the heathen that were about us saw these thing they were much
cast down in their own eyes: for they perceiv that thi work wa
wrought of our god

6:17 moreov in those day the nobl of judah sent mani letter unto
tobiah and the letter of tobiah came unto them

6:18 for there were mani in judah sworn unto him becaus he wa the
son in law of shechaniah the son of arah; and hi son johanan had
taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah

6:19 also they report hi good deed befor me and utter my word
to him and tobiah sent letter to put me in fear

7:1 now it came to pass when the wall wa built and i had set up the
door and the porter and the singer and the levit were appoint
7:2 that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the
palac charg over jerusalem: for he wa a faith man and fear
god abov mani

7:3 and i said unto them let not the gate of jerusalem be open
until the sun be hot; and while they stand by let them shut the
door and bar them: and appoint watch of the inhabit of
jerusalem everi one in hi watch and everi one to be over against
hi hous

7:4 now the citi wa larg and great: but the peopl were few therein
and the hous were not build

7:5 and my god put into mine heart to gather togeth the nobl and
the ruler and the peopl that they might be reckon by genealog
and i found a regist of the genealog of them which came up at the
first and found written therein 7:6 these are the children of the

of israel were in their citi

8:1 and all the peopl gather themselv togeth as one man into

8:12 and all the peopl went their way to eat and to drink and to

8:13 and on the second day were gather togeth the chief of the
father of all the peopl the priest and the levit unto ezra the

8:14 and they found written in the law which the lord had command by

in all their citi and in jerusalem say go forth unto the

branch and palm branch and branch of thick tree to make

8:16 so the peopl went forth and brought them and made themselv
booth everi one upon the roof of hi hous and in their court and
in the court of the hous of god and in the street of the water
gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim

8:17 and all the congreg of them that were come again out of the
captiv made booth and sat under the booths: for sinc the day of
jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel
done so and there wa veri great glad

8:18 also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in
the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days; and on
the eighth day wa a solemn assembl accord unto the manner

9:1 now in the twenti and fourth day of thi month the children of
israel were assembl with fast and with sackcloth and earth
upon them

9:2 and the seed of israel separ themselv from all stranger
and stood and confess their sin and the iniqu of their
father

9:3 and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law
of the lord their god one fourth part of the day; and anoth fourth

9:4 then stood up upon the stair of the levit jeshua and bani

with a loud voic unto the lord their god

9:5 then the levit jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah
sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless
the lord your god for ever and ever: and bless be thi gloriou name
which is exalt abov all bless and prais

9:6 thou even thou art lord alone; thou hast made heaven the heaven
of heaven with all their host the earth and all thing that are
therein the sea and all that is therein and thou preservest them
all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee

9:7 thou art the lord the god who didst choos abram and broughtest
him forth out of ur of the chalde and gavest him the name of
abraham; 9:8 and foundest hi heart faith befor thee and madest a
coven with him to give the land of the canaanit the hittit
the amorit and the perizzit and the jebusit and the
girgashit to give it i say to hi seed and hast perform thi
words; for thou art righteous: 9:9 and didst see the afflict of our
father in egypt and heardest their cri by the red sea; 9:10 and
shewedst sign and wonder upon pharaoh and on all hi servant and
on all the peopl of hi land: for thou knewest that they dealt
proudli against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is thi
day

9:11 and thou didst divid the sea befor them so that they went
through the midst of the sea on the dri land; and their persecutor
thou threwest into the deep as a stone into the mighti water

9:12 moreov thou leddest them in the day by a cloudi pillar; and in
the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein
they should go

9:13 thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them
from heaven and gavest them right judgment and true law good
statut and commandments: 9:14 and madest known unto them thi holi
sabbath and commandedst them precept statut and law by the
hand of mose thi servant: 9:15 and gavest them bread from heaven for
their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for
their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
the land which thou hadst sworn to give them

9:16 but they and our father dealt proudli and harden their neck
and hearken not to thi command 9:17 and refus to obey
neither were mind of thi wonder that thou didst among them; but
harden their neck and in their rebellion appoint a captain to
return to their bondage: but thou art a god readi to pardon graciou
and merci slow to anger and of great kind and forsookest
them not

9:18 yea when they had made them a molten calf and said thi is thi
god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great
provocations; 9:19 yet thou in thi manifold merci forsookest them
not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud depart not from them
by day to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night
to shew them light and the way wherein they should go

9:20 thou gavest also thi good spirit to instruct them and
withheldest not thi manna from their mouth and gavest them water for
their thirst

9:21 yea forti year didst thou sustain them in the wilder so
that they lack nothing; their cloth wax not old and their feet
swell not

9:22 moreov thou gavest them kingdom and nation and didst divid
them into corners: so they possess the land of sihon and the land
of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan

9:23 their children also multipliedst thou as the star of heaven and
broughtest them into the land concern which thou hadst promis to
their father that they should go in to possess it

9:24 so the children went in and possess the land and thou
subduedst befor them the inhabit of the land the canaanit and
gavest them into their hand with their king and the peopl of the
land that they might do with them as they would

9:25 and they took strong citi and a fat land and possess hous
full of all good well dig vineyard and oliveyard and fruit
tree in abundance: so they did eat and were fill and becam fat
and delight themselv in thi great good

9:26 nevertheless they were disobedi and rebel against thee
and cast thi law behind their back and slew thi prophet which
testifi against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great
provoc

9:27 therefor thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemi
who vex them: and in the time of their troubl when they cri unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven; and accord to thi manifold
merci thou gavest them saviour who save them out of the hand of
their enemi

9:28 but after they had rest they did evil again befor thee:
therefor leftest thou them in the land of their enemi so that they
had the dominion over them: yet when they return and cri unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven; and mani time didst thou
deliv them accord to thi mercies; 9:29 and testifiedst against
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thi law: yet they dealt
proudli and hearken not unto thi command but sin against
thi judgment (which if a man do he shall live in them;) and
withdrew the shoulder and harden their neck and would not hear

9:30 yet mani year didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against
them by thi spirit in thi prophets: yet would they not give ear:
therefor gavest thou them into the hand of the peopl of the land

9:31 nevertheless for thi great merci sake thou didst not utterli
consum them nor forsak them; for thou art a graciou and merci
god

9:32 now therefor our god the great the mighti and the terribl
god who keepest coven and merci let not all the troubl seem
littl befor thee that hath come upon us on our king on our
princ and on our priest and on our prophet and on our father
and on all thi peopl sinc the time of the king of assyria unto
thi day

9:33 howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
hast done right but we have done wickedly: 9:34 neither have our
king our princ our priest nor our father kept thi law nor
hearken unto thi command and thi testimoni wherewith thou
didst testifi against them

9:35 for they have not serv thee in their kingdom and in thi great
good that thou gavest them and in the larg and fat land which
thou gavest befor them neither turn they from their wick work

9:36 behold we are servant thi day and for the land that thou
gavest unto our father to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof
behold we are servant in it: 9:37 and it yieldeth much increas unto
the king whom thou hast set over us becaus of our sins: also they
have dominion over our bodi and over our cattl at their pleasur
and we are in great distress

9:38 and becaus of all thi we make a sure coven and write it;
and our princ levit and priest seal unto it

10:1 now those that seal were nehemiah the tirshatha the son of

day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on

exact of everi debt

10:32 also we made ordin for us to charg ourselv yearli with

the continu burnt offer of the sabbath of the new moon for

holi citi and nine part to dwell in other citi

11:2 and the peopl bless all the men that willingli offer

12:46 for in the day of david and asaph of old there were chief of

12:47 and all israel in the day of zerubbabel and in the day of
nehemiah gave the portion of the singer and the porter everi day
hi portion: and they sanctifi holi thing unto the levites; and the
levit sanctifi them unto the children of aaron

13:1 on that day they read in the book of mose in the audienc of the
people; and therein wa found written that the ammonit and the
moabit should not come into the congreg of god for ever; 13:2
becaus they met not the children of israel with bread and with water
but hire balaam against them that he should curs them: howbeit our
god turn the curs into a bless

13:3 now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they
separ from israel all the mix multitud

13:4 and befor thi eliashib the priest have the oversight of the
chamber of the hous of our god wa alli unto tobiah: 13:5 and he
had prepar for him a great chamber where aforetim they laid the
meat offer the frankincens and the vessel and the tith of
the corn the new wine and the oil which wa command to be given
to the levit and the singer and the porters; and the offer of
the priest

13:6 but in all thi time wa not i at jerusalem: for in the two and
thirtieth year of artaxerx king of babylon came i unto the king and
after certain day obtain i leav of the king: 13:7 and i came to
jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in
prepar him a chamber in the court of the hous of god

13:8 and it griev me sore: therefor i cast forth all the household
stuff to tobiah out of the chamber

13:9 then i command and they cleans the chambers: and thither
brought i again the vessel of the hous of god with the meat
offer and the frankincens

13:10 and i perceiv that the portion of the levit had not been
given them: for the levit and the singer that did the work were
fled everi one to hi field

13:11 then contend i with the ruler and said whi is the hous of
god forsaken? and i gather them togeth and set them in their
place

13:12 then brought all judah the tith of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the treasuri

13:13 and i made treasur over the treasuri shelemiah the priest
and zadok the scribe and of the levit pedaiah: and next to them
wa hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah: for they were
count faith and their offic wa to distribut unto their
brethren

13:14 rememb me o my god concern thi and wipe not out my good
deed that i have done for the hous of my god and for the offic
thereof

13:15 in those day saw i in judah some tread wine press on the
sabbath and bring in sheav and lade asses; as also wine
grape and fig and all manner of burden which they brought into
jerusalem on the sabbath day: and i testifi against them in the day
wherein they sold victual

13:16 there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and
all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of
judah and in jerusalem

13:17 then i contend with the nobl of judah and said unto them
what evil thing is thi that ye do and profan the sabbath day?
13:18 did not your father thu and did not our god bring all thi
evil upon us and upon thi city? yet ye bring more wrath upon israel
by profan the sabbath

13:19 and it came to pass that when the gate of jerusalem began to
be dark befor the sabbath i command that the gate should be shut
and charg that they should not be open till after the sabbath: and
some of my servant set i at the gate that there should no burden be
brought in on the sabbath day

13:20 so the merchant and seller of all kind of ware lodg without
jerusalem onc or twice

13:21 then i testifi against them and said unto them whi lodg ye
about the wall? if ye do so again i will lay hand on you from that
time forth came they no more on the sabbath

13:22 and i command the levit that they should cleans themselv
and that they should come and keep the gate to sanctifi the sabbath
day

rememb me o my god concern thi also and spare me accord to
the great of thi merci

13:23 in those day also saw i jew that had marri wive of ashdod
of ammon and of moab: 13:24 and their children spake half in the
speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jew languag but
accord to the languag of each peopl

13:25 and i contend with them and curs them and smote certain of
them and pluck off their hair and made them swear by god say
ye shall not give your daughter unto their son nor take their
daughter unto your son or for yourselv

13:26 did not solomon king of israel sin by these things? yet among
mani nation wa there no king like him who wa belov of hi god
and god made him king over all israel: nevertheless even him did
outlandish women caus to sin

13:27 shall we then hearken unto you to do all thi great evil to
transgress against our god in marri strang wives? 13:28 and one
of the son of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest wa son in
law to sanballat the horonite: therefor i chase him from me

13:29 rememb them o my god becaus they have defil the
priesthood and the coven of the priesthood and of the levit

13:30 thu cleans i them from all stranger and appoint the ward
of the priest and the levit everi one in hi business; 13:31 and
for the wood offer at time appoint and for the firstfruit
rememb me o my god for good

1:7 and they gave them drink in vessel of gold (the vessel be

1:10 on the seventh day when the heart of the king wa merri with

for she wa fair to look on

1:12 but the queen vashti refus to come at the king command by
hi chamberlains: therefor wa the king veri wroth and hi anger
burn in him

1:13 then the king said to the wise men which knew the time (for so
wa the king manner toward all that knew law and judgment: 1:14 and
the next unto him wa carshena shethar admatha tarshish mere
marsena and memucan the seven princ of persia and media which saw
the king face and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 1:15 what
shall we do unto the queen vashti accord to law becaus she hath
not perform the command of the king ahasueru by the
chamberlains? 1:16 and memucan answer befor the king and the
princ vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king onli but

provinc of the king ahasueru

1:17 for thi deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so

in befor him but she came not

1:18 likewis shall the ladi of persia and media say thi day unto
all the king princ which have heard of the deed of the queen
thu shall there aris too much contempt and wrath

1:19 if it pleas the king let there go a royal command from him
and let it be written among the law of the persian and the mede
that it be not alter that vashti come no more befor king
ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estat unto anoth that is

1:20 and when the king decre which he shall make shall be publish
throughout all hi empir (for it is great) all the wive shall give
to their husband honour both to great and small

1:21 and the say pleas the king and the princes; and the king did
accord to the word of memucan: 1:22 for he sent letter into all
the king provinc into everi provinc accord to the write
thereof and to everi peopl after their languag that everi man
should bear rule in hi own hous and that it should be publish
accord to the languag of everi peopl

2:1 after these thing when the wrath of king ahasueru wa appeas
he rememb vashti and what she had done and what wa decre

2:2 then said the king servant that minist unto him let there
be fair young virgin sought for the king: 2:3 and let the king
appoint offic in all the provinc of hi kingdom that they may
gather togeth all the fair young virgin unto shushan the palac to
the hous of the women unto the custodi of hege the king
chamberlain keeper of the women; and let their thing for
purif be given them: 2:4 and let the maiden which pleaseth the
king be queen instead of vashti

and the thing pleas the king; and he did so

2:5 now in shushan the palac there wa a certain jew whose name wa
mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a
benjamite; 2:6 who had been carri away from jerusalem with the
captiv which had been carri away with jeconiah king of judah
whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carri away

2:7 and he brought up hadassah that is esther hi uncl daughter:
for she had neither father nor mother and the maid wa fair and
beautiful; whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took

2:8 so it came to pass when the king command and hi decre wa
heard and when mani maiden were gather togeth unto shushan the
palac to the custodi of hegai that esther wa brought also unto the
king hous to the custodi of hegai keeper of the women

2:9 and the maiden pleas him and she obtain kind of him; and
he speedili gave her her thing for purif with such thing as

out of the king house: and he prefer her and her maid unto the
best place of the hous of the women

2:10 esther had not shew her peopl nor her kindred: for mordecai
had charg her that she should not shew it

2:11 and mordecai walk everi day befor the court of the women
hous to know how esther did and what should becom of her

2:12 now when everi maid turn wa come to go in to king ahasueru
after that she had been twelv month accord to the manner of the
women (for so were the day of their purif accomplish to
wit six month with oil of myrrh and six month with sweet odour
and with other thing for the purifi of the women;) 2:13 then thu

2:14 in the even she went and on the morrow she return into the
second hous of the women to the custodi of shaashgaz the king
chamberlain which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no

2:15 now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncl of
mordecai who had taken her for hi daughter wa come to go in unto
the king she requir noth but what hegai the king chamberlain
the keeper of the women appoint and esther obtain favour in the
sight of all them that look upon her

2:16 so esther wa taken unto king ahasueru into hi hous royal in
the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of hi
reign

2:17 and the king love esther abov all the women and she obtain
grace and favour in hi sight more than all the virgins; so that he
set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of

2:18 then the king made a great feast unto all hi princ and hi
servant even esther feast; and he made a releas to the provinc
and gave gift accord to the state of the king

2:19 and when the virgin were gather togeth the second time then
mordecai sat in the king gate

2:20 esther had not yet shew her kindr nor her people; as mordecai
had charg her: for esther did the command of mordecai like as
when she wa brought up with him

2:21 in those day while mordecai sat in the king gate two of the
king chamberlain bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door
were wroth and sought to lay hand on the king ahasueru

2:22 and the thing wa known to mordecai who told it unto esther the
queen; and esther certifi the king thereof in mordecai name

2:23 and when inquisit wa made of the matter it wa found out;
therefor they were both hang on a tree: and it wa written in the
book of the chronicl befor the king

3:1 after these thing did king ahasueru promot haman the son of
hammedatha the agagit and advanc him and set hi seat abov all
the princ that were with him

3:2 and all the king servant that were in the king gate bow
and reverenc haman: for the king had so command concern him
but mordecai bow not nor did him rever

3:3 then the king servant which were in the king gate said unto
mordecai whi transgressest thou the king commandment? 3:4 now it
came to pass when they spake daili unto him and he hearken not
unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai matter
would stand: for he had told them that he wa a jew

3:5 and when haman saw that mordecai bow not nor did him rever
then wa haman full of wrath

3:6 and he thought scorn to lay hand on mordecai alone; for they had
shew him the peopl of mordecai: wherefor haman sought to destroy
all the jew that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasueru even
the peopl of mordecai

3:7 in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year
of king ahasueru they cast pur that is the lot befor haman from
day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is
the month adar

3:8 and haman said unto king ahasueru there is a certain peopl
scatter abroad and dispers among the peopl in all the provinc
of thi kingdom; and their law are divers from all people; neither
keep they the king laws: therefor it is not for the king profit
to suffer them

3:9 if it pleas the king let it be written that they may be
destroyed: and i will pay ten thousand talent of silver to the hand
of those that have the charg of the busi to bring it into the
king treasuri

3:10 and the king took hi ring from hi hand and gave it unto haman
the son of hammedatha the agagit the jew enemi

3:11 and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the
peopl also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee

3:12 then were the king scribe call on the thirteenth day of the
first month and there wa written accord to all that haman had
command unto the king lieuten and to the governor that were
over everi provinc and to the ruler of everi peopl of everi
provinc accord to the write thereof and to everi peopl after
their language; in the name of king ahasueru wa it written and

3:13 and the letter were sent by post into all the king provinc
to destroy to kill and to caus to perish all jew both young and
old littl children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth
day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the
spoil of them for a prey

3:14 the copi of the write for a command to be given in everi
provinc wa publish unto all peopl that they should be readi
against that day

3:15 the post went out be hasten by the king command and
the decre wa given in shushan the palac and the king and haman sat
down to drink; but the citi shushan wa perplex

4:1 when mordecai perceiv all that wa done mordecai rent hi
cloth and put on sackcloth with ash and went out into the midst
of the citi and cri with a loud and a bitter cry; 4:2 and came even
befor the king gate: for none might enter into the king gate
cloth with sackcloth

4:3 and in everi provinc whithersoev the king command and
hi decre came there wa great mourn among the jew and fast
and weep and wailing; and mani lay in sackcloth and ash

4:4 so esther maid and her chamberlain came and told it her then
wa the queen exceedingli grieved; and she sent raiment to cloth
mordecai and to take away hi sackcloth from him: but he receiv it
not

4:5 then call esther for hatach one of the king chamberlain
whom he had appoint to attend upon her and gave him a command
to mordecai to know what it wa and whi it wa

4:6 so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the citi
which wa befor the king gate

4:7 and mordecai told him of all that had happen unto him and of
the sum of the money that haman had promis to pay to the king
treasuri for the jew to destroy them

4:8 also he gave him the copi of the write of the decre that wa
given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to
declar it unto her and to charg her that she should go in unto the
king to make supplic unto him and to make request befor him
for her peopl

4:9 and hatach came and told esther the word of mordecai

4:10 again esther spake unto hatach and gave him command unto
mordecai; 4:11 all the king servant and the peopl of the king
provinc do know that whosoev whether man or women shall come
unto the king into the inner court who is not call there is one
law of hi to put him to death except such to whom the king shall
hold out the golden sceptr that he may live: but i have not been
call to come in unto the king these thirti day

4:12 and they told to mordecai esther word

4:13 then mordecai command to answer esther think not with thyself
that thou shalt escap in the king hous more than all the jew

4:14 for if thou altogeth holdest thi peac at thi time then shall
there enlarg and deliver aris to the jew from anoth
place; but thou and thi father hous shall be destroyed: and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
4:15 then esther bade them return mordecai thi answer 4:16 go
gather togeth all the jew that are present in shushan and fast ye
for me and neither eat nor drink three day night or day: i also and
my maiden will fast likewise; and so will i go in unto the king

4:17 so mordecai went hi way and did accord to all that esther
had command him

5:1 now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal
apparel and stood in the inner court of the king hous over
against the king house: and the king sat upon hi royal throne in

if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it pleas the
king to grant my petit and to perform my request let the king and
haman come to the banquet that i shall prepar for them and i will do

5:10 nevertheless haman refrain himself: and when he came home he

to morrow am i invit unto her also with the king

5:13 yet all thi availeth me noth so long as i see mordecai the

5:14 then said zeresh hi wife and all hi friend unto him let a

the king that mordecai may be hang thereon: then go thou in merrili
with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleas haman; and he

6:2 and it wa found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and
teresh two of the king chamberlain the keeper of the door who
sought to lay hand on the king ahasueru

6:3 and the king said what honour and digniti hath been done to

6:4 and the king said who is in the court? now haman wa come into
the outward court of the king hous to speak unto the king to hang
mordecai on the gallow that he had prepar for him

6:5 and the king servant said unto him behold haman standeth in
the court and the king said let him come in

6:6 so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? now haman thought in
hi heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to

king useth to wear and the hors that the king rideth upon and the
crown royal which is set upon hi head: 6:9 and let thi apparel and

princ that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth
to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the citi
and proclaim befor him thu shall it be done to the man whom the

6:10 then the king said to haman make hast and take the apparel and

6:11 then took haman the apparel and the hors and array mordecai
and brought him on horseback through the street of the citi and

6:12 and mordecai came again to the king gate but haman hast to

6:13 and haman told zeresh hi wife and all hi friend everi thing
that had befallen him then said hi wise men and zeresh hi wife unto

although the enemi could not countervail the king damag

7:5 then the king ahasueru answer and said unto esther the queen

7:6 and esther said the adversari and enemi is thi wick haman

wrote to destroy the jew which are in all the king provinces: 8:6
for how can i endur to see the evil that shall come unto my people?
or how can i endur to see the destruct of my kindred? 8:7 then

all peopl

9:3 and all the ruler of the provinc and the lieuten and the
deputi and offic of the king help the jews; becaus the fear

9:4 for mordecai wa great in the king hous and hi fame went out

9:5 thu the jew smote all their enemi with the stroke of the

of the jew slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand

9:11 on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the
palac wa brought befor the king

9:12 and the king said unto esther the queen the jew have slain and
destroy five hundr men in shushan the palac and the ten son of
haman; what have they done in the rest of the king provinces? now
what is thi petition? and it shall be grant thee: or what is thi

the book of job


1:1 there wa a man in the land of uz whose name wa job; and that
man wa perfect and upright and one that fear god and eschew evil

1:2 and there were born unto him seven son and three daughter

1:3 hi substanc also wa seven thousand sheep and three thousand
camel and five hundr yoke of oxen and five hundr she ass and
a veri great household; so that thi man wa the greatest of all the
men of the east

1:4 and hi son went and feast in their hous everi one hi day;
and sent and call for their three sister to eat and to drink with
them

1:5 and it wa so when the day of their feast were gone about
that job sent and sanctifi them and rose up earli in the morn
and offer burnt offer accord to the number of them all: for
job said it may be that my son have sin and curs god in their
heart thu did job continu

1:6 now there wa a day when the son of god came to present
themselv befor the lord and satan came also among them

1:7 and the lord said unto satan whenc comest thou? then satan
answer the lord and said from go to and fro in the earth and
from walk up and down in it

1:8 and the lord said unto satan hast thou consid my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil? 1:9 then satan
answer the lord and said doth job fear god for nought? 1:10 hast
not thou made an hedg about him and about hi hous and about all
that he hath on everi side? thou hast bless the work of hi hand
and hi substanc is increas in the land

1:11 but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he
will curs thee to thi face

1:12 and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thi
power; onli upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth
from the presenc of the lord

1:13 and there wa a day when hi son and hi daughter were eat
and drink wine in their eldest brother house: 1:14 and there came
a messeng unto job and said the oxen were plow and the ass
feed besid them: 1:15 and the sabean fell upon them and took
them away; yea they have slain the servant with the edg of the
sword; and i onli am escap alon to tell thee

1:16 while he wa yet speak there came also anoth and said the
fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burn up the sheep and
the servant and consum them; and i onli am escap alon to tell
thee

1:17 while he wa yet speak there came also anoth and said the
chaldean made out three band and fell upon the camel and have
carri them away yea and slain the servant with the edg of the
sword; and i onli am escap alon to tell thee

1:18 while he wa yet speak there came also anoth and said thi
son and thi daughter were eat and drink wine in their eldest
brother house: 1:19 and behold there came a great wind from the
wilder and smote the four corner of the hous and it fell upon
the young men and they are dead; and i onli am escap alon to tell
thee

1:20 then job aros and rent hi mantl and shave hi head and
fell down upon the ground and worship 1:21 and said nake came i
out of my mother womb and nake shall i return thither: the lord
gave and the lord hath taken away; bless be the name of the lord

1:22 in all thi job sin not nor charg god foolishli

2:1 again there wa a day when the son of god came to present
themselv befor the lord and satan came also among them to present
himself befor the lord

2:2 and the lord said unto satan from whenc comest thou? and satan
answer the lord and said from go to and fro in the earth and
from walk up and down in it

2:3 and the lord said unto satan hast thou consid my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
fast hi integr although thou movedst me against him to destroy
him without caus

2:4 and satan answer the lord and said skin for skin yea all
that a man hath will he give for hi life

2:5 but put forth thine hand now and touch hi bone and hi flesh
and he will curs thee to thi face

2:6 and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand; but
save hi life

2:7 so went satan forth from the presenc of the lord and smote job
with sore boil from the sole of hi foot unto hi crown

2:8 and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat
down among the ash

2:9 then said hi wife unto him dost thou still retain thine
integrity? curs god and die

2:10 but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women
speaketh what? shall we receiv good at the hand of god and shall we
not receiv evil? in all thi did not job sin with hi lip

2:11 now when job three friend heard of all thi evil that wa come
upon him they came everi one from hi own place; eliphaz the
temanit and bildad the shuhit and zophar the naamathite: for they
had made an appoint togeth to come to mourn with him and to
comfort him

2:12 and when they lift up their eye afar off and knew him not
they lift up their voic and wept; and they rent everi one hi
mantl and sprinkl dust upon their head toward heaven

2:13 so they sat down with him upon the ground seven day and seven
night and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that hi grief
wa veri great

3:1 after thi open job hi mouth and curs hi day

3:2 and job spake and said 3:3 let the day perish wherein i wa
born and the night in which it wa said there is a man child
conceiv

3:4 let that day be darkness; let not god regard it from abov
neither let the light shine upon it

3:5 let dark and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
upon it; let the black of the day terrifi it

3:6 as for that night let dark seiz upon it; let it not be
join unto the day of the year let it not come into the number of
the month

3:7 lo let that night be solitari let no joy voic come therein

3:8 let them curs it that curs the day who are readi to rais up
their mourn

3:9 let the star of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
light but have none; neither let it see the dawn of the day: 3:10
becaus it shut not up the door of my mother womb nor hid sorrow
from mine eye

3:11 whi die i not from the womb? whi did i not give up the ghost
when i came out of the belly? 3:12 whi did the knee prevent me? or
whi the breast that i should suck? 3:13 for now should i have lain
still and been quiet i should have slept: then had i been at rest
3:14 with king and counsellor of the earth which build desol
place for themselves; 3:15 or with princ that had gold who fill
their hous with silver: 3:16 or as an hidden untim birth i had
not been; as infant which never saw light

3:17 there the wick ceas from troubling; and there the weari be at
rest

3:18 there the prison rest together; they hear not the voic of the
oppressor

3:19 the small and great are there; and the servant is free from hi
master

3:20 wherefor is light given to him that is in miseri and life unto
the bitter in soul; 3:21 which long for death but it cometh not; and
dig for it more than for hid treasures; 3:22 which rejoic
exceedingli and are glad when they can find the grave? 3:23 whi is
light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedg in?
3:24 for my sigh cometh befor i eat and my roar are pour
out like the water

3:25 for the thing which i greatli fear is come upon me and that
which i wa afraid of is come unto me

3:26 i wa not in safeti neither had i rest neither wa i quiet; yet
troubl came

4:1 then eliphaz the temanit answer and said 4:2 if we assay to
commun with thee wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself
from speaking? 4:3 behold thou hast instruct mani and thou hast
strengthen the weak hand

4:4 thi word have upholden him that wa fall and thou hast
strengthen the feebl knee

4:5 but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest; it toucheth thee
and thou art troubl

4:6 is not thi thi fear thi confid thi hope and the
upright of thi ways? 4:7 rememb i pray thee who ever
perish be innocent? or where were the righteou cut off? 4:8
even as i have seen they that plow iniqu and sow wicked reap
the same

4:9 by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of hi nostril
are they consum

4:10 the roar of the lion and the voic of the fierc lion and
the teeth of the young lion are broken

4:11 the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lion
whelp are scatter abroad

4:12 now a thing wa secretli brought to me and mine ear receiv a
littl thereof

4:13 in thought from the vision of the night when deep sleep
falleth on men 4:14 fear came upon me and trembl which made all
my bone to shake

4:15 then a spirit pass befor my face; the hair of my flesh stood
up: 4:16 it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof: an
imag wa befor mine eye there wa silenc and i heard a voic
say 4:17 shall mortal man be more just than god? shall a man be
more pure than hi maker? 4:18 behold he put no trust in hi
servants; and hi angel he charg with folly: 4:19 how much less in
them that dwell in hous of clay whose foundat is in the dust
which are crush befor the moth? 4:20 they are destroy from
morn to evening: they perish for ever without ani regard it

4:21 doth not their excel which is in them go away? they die
even without wisdom

5:1 call now if there be ani that will answer thee; and to which of
the saint wilt thou turn? 5:2 for wrath killeth the foolish man and
envi slayeth the silli one

5:3 i have seen the foolish take root: but suddenli i curs hi
habit

5:4 hi children are far from safeti and they are crush in the
gate neither is there ani to deliv them

5:5 whose harvest the hungri eateth up and taketh it even out of the
thorn and the robber swalloweth up their substanc

5:6 although afflict cometh not forth of the dust neither doth
troubl spring out of the ground; 5:7 yet man is born unto troubl as
the spark fli upward

5:8 i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause: 5:9
which doeth great thing and unsearchable; marvel thing without
number: 5:10 who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth water upon
the fields: 5:11 to set up on high those that be low; that those which
mourn may be exalt to safeti

5:12 he disappointeth the devic of the crafti so that their hand
cannot perform their enterpris

5:13 he taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
the froward is carri headlong

5:14 they meet with dark in the day time and grope in the noonday
as in the night

5:15 but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from
the hand of the mighti

5:16 so the poor hath hope and iniqu stoppeth her mouth

5:17 behold happi is the man whom god correcteth: therefor despis
not thou the chasten of the almighty: 5:18 for he maketh sore and
bindeth up: he woundeth and hi hand make whole

5:19 he shall deliv thee in six troubles: yea in seven there shall
no evil touch thee

5:20 in famin he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
power of the sword

5:21 thou shalt be hid from the scourg of the tongue: neither shalt
thou be afraid of destruct when it cometh

5:22 at destruct and famin thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beast of the earth

5:23 for thou shalt be in leagu with the stone of the field: and the
beast of the field shall be at peac with thee

5:24 and thou shalt know that thi tabernacl shall be in peace; and
thou shalt visit thi habit and shalt not sin

5:25 thou shalt know also that thi seed shall be great and thine
offspr as the grass of the earth

5:26 thou shalt come to thi grave in a full age like as a shock of
corn cometh in in hi season

5:27 lo thi we have search it so it is; hear it and know thou it
for thi good

6:1 but job answer and said 6:2 oh that my grief were throughli
weigh and my calam laid in the balanc together! 6:3 for now
it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefor my word are
swallow up

6:4 for the arrow of the almighti are within me the poison whereof
drinketh up my spirit: the terror of god do set themselv in array
against me

6:5 doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
hi fodder? 6:6 can that which is unsavouri be eaten without salt? or
is there ani tast in the white of an egg? 6:7 the thing that my
soul refus to touch are as my sorrow meat

6:8 oh that i might have my request; and that god would grant me the
thing that i long for! 6:9 even that it would pleas god to destroy
me; that he would let loos hi hand and cut me off! 6:10 then
should i yet have comfort; yea i would harden myself in sorrow: let
him not spare; for i have not conceal the word of the holi one

6:11 what is my strength that i should hope? and what is mine end
that i should prolong my life? 6:12 is my strength the strength of
stones? or is my flesh of brass? 6:13 is not my help in me? and is
wisdom driven quit from me? 6:14 to him that is afflict piti
should be shew from hi friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the
almighti

6:15 my brethren have dealt deceit as a brook and as the stream
of brook they pass away; 6:16 which are blackish by reason of the
ice and wherein the snow is hid: 6:17 what time they wax warm they
vanish: when it is hot they are consum out of their place

6:18 the path of their way are turn aside; they go to noth and
perish

6:19 the troop of tema look the compani of sheba wait for
them

6:20 they were confound becaus they had hoped; they came thither
and were asham

6:21 for now ye are nothing; ye see my cast down and are afraid

6:22 did i say bring unto me? or give a reward for me of your
substance? 6:23 or deliv me from the enemi hand? or redeem me
from the hand of the mighty? 6:24 teach me and i will hold my
tongue: and caus me to understand wherein i have er

6:25 how forcibl are right words! but what doth your argu reprove?
6:26 do ye imagin to reprov word and the speech of one that is
desper which are as wind? 6:27 yea ye overwhelm the fatherless
and ye dig a pit for your friend

6:28 now therefor be content look upon me; for it is evid unto
you if i lie

6:29 return i pray you let it not be iniquity; yea return again my
righteous is in it

6:30 is there iniqu in my tongue? cannot my tast discern pervers
things? 7:1 is there not an appoint time to man upon earth? are not
hi day also like the day of an hireling? 7:2 as a servant
earnestli desireth the shadow and as an hirel looketh for the
reward of hi work: 7:3 so am i made to possess month of vaniti and
wearisom night are appoint to me

7:4 when i lie down i say when shall i aris and the night be gone?
and i am full of toss to and fro unto the dawn of the day

7:5 my flesh is cloth with worm and clod of dust; my skin is
broken and becom loathsom

7:6 my day are swifter than a weaver shuttl and are spent without
hope

7:7 o rememb that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good

7:8 the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eye
are upon me and i am not

7:9 as the cloud is consum and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
to the grave shall come up no more

7:10 he shall return no more to hi hous neither shall hi place
know him ani more

7:11 therefor i will not refrain my mouth; i will speak in the
anguish of my spirit; i will complain in the bitter of my soul

7:12 am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall eas my
complaints; 7:14 then thou scarest me with dream and terrifiest me
through visions: 7:15 so that my soul chooseth strangl and death
rather than my life

7:16 i loath it; i would not live alway: let me alone; for my day
are vaniti

7:17 what is man that thou shouldest magnifi him? and that thou
shouldest set thine heart upon him? 7:18 and that thou shouldest
visit him everi morn and tri him everi moment? 7:19 how long wilt
thou not depart from me nor let me alon till i swallow down my
spittle? 7:20 i have sinned; what shall i do unto thee o thou
preserv of men? whi hast thou set me as a mark against thee so
that i am a burden to myself? 7:21 and whi dost thou not pardon my
transgress and take away my iniquity? for now shall i sleep in the
dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morn but i shall not be

8:1 then answer bildad the shuhit and said 8:2 how long wilt thou
speak these things? and how long shall the word of thi mouth be like
a strong wind? 8:3 doth god pervert judgment? or doth the almighti
pervert justice? 8:4 if thi children have sin against him and he
have cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 if thou wouldest seek
unto god betim and make thi supplic to the almighty; 8:6 if
thou wert pure and upright; sure now he would awak for thee and
make the habit of thi righteous prosper

8:7 though thi begin wa small yet thi latter end should greatli
increas

8:8 for enquir i pray thee of the former age and prepar thyself
to the search of their fathers: 8:9 (for we are but of yesterday and
know noth becaus our day upon earth are a shadow:) 8:10 shall
not they teach thee and tell thee and utter word out of their
heart? 8:11 can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow
without water? 8:12 whilst it is yet in hi green and not cut
down it withereth befor ani other herb

8:13 so are the path of all that forget god; and the hypocrit hope
shall perish: 8:14 whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall
be a spider web

8:15 he shall lean upon hi hous but it shall not stand: he shall
hold it fast but it shall not endur

8:16 he is green befor the sun and hi branch shooteth forth in hi
garden

8:17 hi root are wrap about the heap and seeth the place of
stone

8:18 if he destroy him from hi place then it shall deni him say
i have not seen thee

8:19 behold thi is the joy of hi way and out of the earth shall
other grow

8:20 behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he
help the evil doers: 8:21 till he fill thi mouth with laugh and
thi lip with rejoic

8:22 they that hate thee shall be cloth with shame; and the dwell
place of the wick shall come to nought

9:1 then job answer and said 9:2 i know it is so of a truth: but
how should man be just with god? 9:3 if he will contend with him he
cannot answer him one of a thousand

9:4 he is wise in heart and mighti in strength: who hath harden
himself against him and hath prospered? 9:5 which removeth the
mountain and they know not: which overturneth them in hi anger

9:6 which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillar thereof
trembl

9:7 which commandeth the sun and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
star

9:8 which alon spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave
of the sea

9:9 which maketh arcturu orion and pleiad and the chamber of
the south

9:10 which doeth great thing past find out; yea and wonder
without number

9:11 lo he goeth by me and i see him not: he passeth on also but i
perceiv him not

9:12 behold he taketh away who can hinder him? who will say unto
him what doest thou? 9:13 if god will not withdraw hi anger the
proud helper do stoop under him

9:14 how much less shall i answer him and choos out my word to
reason with him? 9:15 whom though i were righteou yet would i not
answer but i would make supplic to my judg

9:16 if i had call and he had answer me; yet would i not believ
that he had hearken unto my voic

9:17 for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wound
without caus

9:18 he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with
bitter

9:19 if i speak of strength lo he is strong: and if of judgment who
shall set me a time to plead? 9:20 if i justifi myself mine own
mouth shall condemn me: if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me
pervers

9:21 though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul: i would
despis my life

9:22 thi is one thing therefor i said it he destroyeth the perfect
and the wick

9:23 if the scourg slay suddenli he will laugh at the trial of the
innoc

9:24 the earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
face of the judg thereof; if not where and who is he? 9:25 now
my day are swifter than a post: they flee away they see no good

9:26 they are pass away as the swift ships: as the eagl that
hasteth to the prey

9:27 if i say i will forget my complaint i will leav off my
heavi and comfort myself: 9:28 i am afraid of all my sorrow i
know that thou wilt not hold me innoc

9:29 if i be wick whi then labour i in vain? 9:30 if i wash myself
with snow water and make my hand never so clean; 9:31 yet shalt thou
plung me in the ditch and mine own cloth shall abhor me

9:32 for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we
should come togeth in judgment

9:33 neither is there ani daysman betwixt us that might lay hi hand
upon us both

9:34 let him take hi rod away from me and let not hi fear terrifi
me: 9:35 then would i speak and not fear him; but it is not so with
me

10:1 my soul is weari of my life; i will leav my complaint upon
myself; i will speak in the bitter of my soul

10:2 i will say unto god do not condemn me; shew me wherefor thou
contendest with me

10:3 is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou
shouldest despis the work of thine hand and shine upon the counsel
of the wicked? 10:4 hast thou eye of flesh? or seest thou as man
seeth? 10:5 are thi day as the day of man? are thi year as man
day 10:6 that thou enquirest after mine iniqu and searchest
after my sin? 10:7 thou knowest that i am not wicked; and there is
none that can deliv out of thine hand

10:8 thine hand have made me and fashion me togeth round about;
yet thou dost destroy me

10:9 rememb i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay; and
wilt thou bring me into dust again? 10:10 hast thou not pour me out
as milk and curdl me like cheese? 10:11 thou hast cloth me with
skin and flesh and hast fenc me with bone and sinew

10:12 thou hast grant me life and favour and thi visit hath
preserv my spirit

10:13 and these thing hast thou hid in thine heart: i know that thi
is with thee

10:14 if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from
mine iniqu

10:15 if i be wick woe unto me; and if i be righteou yet will i
not lift up my head i am full of confusion; therefor see thou mine
affliction; 10:16 for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierc lion:
and again thou shewest thyself marvel upon me

10:17 thou renewest thi wit against me and increasest thine
indign upon me; chang and war are against me

10:18 wherefor then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? oh
that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me! 10:19 i should
have been as though i had not been; i should have been carri from
the womb to the grave

10:20 are not my day few? ceas then and let me alon that i may
take comfort a littl 10:21 befor i go whenc i shall not return
even to the land of dark and the shadow of death; 10:22 a land of
dark as dark itself; and of the shadow of death without ani
order and where the light is as dark

11:1 then answer zophar the naamathit and said 11:2 should not
the multitud of word be answered? and should a man full of talk be
justified? 11:3 should thi lie make men hold their peace? and when
thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed? 11:4 for thou hast
said my doctrin is pure and i am clean in thine eye

11:5 but oh that god would speak and open hi lip against thee; 11:6
and that he would shew thee the secret of wisdom that they are
doubl to that which is! know therefor that god exacteth of thee less
than thine iniqu deserveth

11:7 canst thou by search find out god? canst thou find out the
almighti unto perfection? 11:8 it is as high as heaven; what canst
thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? 11:9 the measur
thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea

11:10 if he cut off and shut up or gather togeth then who can
hinder him? 11:11 for he knoweth vain men: he seeth wicked also;
will he not then consid it? 11:12 for vain men would be wise
though man be born like a wild asss colt

11:13 if thou prepar thine heart and stretch out thine hand toward
him; 11:14 if iniqu be in thine hand put it far away and let not
wicked dwell in thi tabernacl

11:15 for then shalt thou lift up thi face without spot; yea thou
shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear: 11:16 becaus thou shalt forget
thi miseri and rememb it as water that pass away: 11:17 and thine
age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth thou
shalt be as the morn

11:18 and thou shalt be secur becaus there is hope; yea thou shalt
dig about thee and thou shalt take thi rest in safeti

11:19 also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid; yea
mani shall make suit unto thee

11:20 but the eye of the wick shall fail and they shall not
escap and their hope shall be as the give up of the ghost

12:1 and job answer and said 12:2 no doubt but ye are the peopl
and wisdom shall die with you

12:3 but i have understand as well as you; i am not inferior to
you: yea who knoweth not such thing as these? 12:4 i am as one
mock of hi neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him:
the just upright man is laugh to scorn

12:5 he that is readi to slip with hi feet is as a lamp despis in
the thought of him that is at eas

12:6 the tabernacl of robber prosper and they that provok god are
secure; into whose hand god bringeth abundantli

12:7 but ask now the beast and they shall teach thee; and the fowl
of the air and they shall tell thee: 12:8 or speak to the earth and
it shall teach thee: and the fish of the sea shall declar unto
thee

12:9 who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath
wrought this? 12:10 in whose hand is the soul of everi live thing
and the breath of all mankind

12:11 doth not the ear tri words? and the mouth tast hi meat? 12:12
with the ancient is wisdom; and in length of day understand

12:13 with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and
understand

12:14 behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again: he
shutteth up a man and there can be no open

12:15 behold he withholdeth the water and they dri up: also he
sendeth them out and they overturn the earth

12:16 with him is strength and wisdom: the deceiv and the deceiv
are hi

12:17 he leadeth counsellor away spoil and maketh the judg
fool

12:18 he looseth the bond of king and girdeth their loin with a
girdl

12:19 he leadeth princ away spoil and overthroweth the mighti

12:20 he removeth away the speech of the trusti and taketh away the
understand of the age

12:21 he poureth contempt upon princ and weakeneth the strength of
the mighti

12:22 he discovereth deep thing out of dark and bringeth out to
light the shadow of death

12:23 he increaseth the nation and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
nation and straiteneth them again

12:24 he taketh away the heart of the chief of the peopl of the
earth and causeth them to wander in a wilder where there is no
way

12:25 they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to
stagger like a drunken man

13:1 lo mine eye hath seen all thi mine ear hath heard and
understood it

13:2 what ye know the same do i know also: i am not inferior unto
you

13:3 sure i would speak to the almighti and i desir to reason with
god

13:4 but ye are forger of lie ye are all physician of no valu

13:5 o that ye would altogeth hold your peace! and it should be your
wisdom

13:6 hear now my reason and hearken to the plead of my lip

13:7 will ye speak wickedli for god? and talk deceit for him?
13:8 will ye accept hi person? will ye contend for god? 13:9 is it
good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh anoth do
ye so mock him? 13:10 he will sure reprov you if ye do secretli
accept person

13:11 shall not hi excel make you afraid? and hi dread fall
upon you? 13:12 your remembr are like unto ash your bodi to
bodi of clay

13:13 hold your peac let me alon that i may speak and let come on
me what will

13:14 wherefor do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in
mine hand? 13:15 though he slay me yet will i trust in him: but i
will maintain mine own way befor him

13:16 he also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrit shall not come
befor him

13:17 hear dilig my speech and my declar with your ear

13:18 behold now i have order my cause; i know that i shall be
justifi

13:19 who is he that will plead with me? for now if i hold my tongu
i shall give up the ghost

13:20 onli do not two thing unto me: then will i not hide myself from
thee

13:21 withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thi dread make me
afraid

13:22 then call thou and i will answer: or let me speak and answer
thou me

13:23 how mani are mine iniqu and sins? make me to know my
transgress and my sin

13:24 wherefor hidest thou thi face and holdest me for thine enemy?
13:25 wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursu
the dri stubble? 13:26 for thou writest bitter thing against me and
makest me to possess the iniqu of my youth

13:27 thou puttest my feet also in the stock and lookest narrowli
unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heel of my feet

13:28 and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth
eaten

14:1 man that is born of a woman is of few day and full of troubl

14:2 he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down: he fleeth also as
a shadow and continueth not

14:3 and doth thou open thine eye upon such an one and bringest me
into judgment with thee? 14:4 who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? not one

14:5 see hi day are determin the number of hi month are with
thee thou hast appoint hi bound that he cannot pass; 14:6 turn
from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hirel
hi day

14:7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will
sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not ceas

14:8 though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock
thereof die in the ground; 14:9 yet through the scent of water it will
bud and bring forth bough like a plant

14:10 but man dieth and wasteth away: yea man giveth up the ghost
and where is he? 14:11 as the water fail from the sea and the flood
decayeth and drieth up: 14:12 so man lieth down and riseth not: till
the heaven be no more they shall not awak nor be rais out of
their sleep

14:13 o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest
keep me secret until thi wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me
a set time and rememb me! 14:14 if a man die shall he live again?
all the day of my appoint time will i wait till my chang come

14:15 thou shalt call and i will answer thee: thou wilt have a desir
to the work of thine hand

14:16 for now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
sin? 14:17 my transgress is seal up in a bag and thou sewest up
mine iniqu

14:18 and sure the mountain fall cometh to nought and the rock
is remov out of hi place

14:19 the water wear the stones: thou washest away the thing which
grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of
man

14:20 thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth: thou
changest hi counten and sendest him away

14:21 hi son come to honour and he knoweth it not; and they are
brought low but he perceiveth it not of them

14:22 but hi flesh upon him shall have pain and hi soul within him
shall mourn

15:1 then answer eliphaz the temanit and said 15:2 should a wise
man utter vain knowledg and fill hi belli with the east wind? 15:3
should he reason with unprofit talk? or with speech wherewith he
can do no good? 15:4 yea thou castest off fear and restrainest
prayer befor god

15:5 for thi mouth uttereth thine iniqu and thou choosest the
tongu of the crafti

15:6 thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i: yea thine own lip
testifi against thee

15:7 art thou the first man that wa born? or wast thou made befor
the hills? 15:8 hast thou heard the secret of god? and dost thou
restrain wisdom to thyself? 15:9 what knowest thou that we know not?
what understandest thou which is not in us? 15:10 with us are both
the grayhead and veri age men much elder than thi father

15:11 are the consol of god small with thee? is there ani secret
thing with thee? 15:12 whi doth thine heart carri thee away? and what
do thi eye wink at 15:13 that thou turnest thi spirit against god
and lettest such word go out of thi mouth? 15:14 what is man that
he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman that he should be
righteous? 15:15 behold he putteth no trust in hi saints; yea the
heaven are not clean in hi sight

15:16 how much more abomin and filthi is man which drinketh
iniqu like water? 15:17 i will shew thee hear me; and that which
i have seen i will declare; 15:18 which wise men have told from their
father and have not hid it: 15:19 unto whom alon the earth wa
given and no stranger pass among them

15:20 the wick man travaileth with pain all hi day and the number
of year is hidden to the oppressor

15:21 a dread sound is in hi ears: in prosper the destroy
shall come upon him

15:22 he believeth not that he shall return out of dark and he is
wait for of the sword

15:23 he wandereth abroad for bread say where is it? he knoweth
that the day of dark is readi at hi hand

15:24 troubl and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
against him as a king readi to the battl

15:25 for he stretcheth out hi hand against god and strengtheneth
himself against the almighti

15:26 he runneth upon him even on hi neck upon the thick boss of
hi bucklers: 15:27 becaus he covereth hi face with hi fat and
maketh collop of fat on hi flank

15:28 and he dwelleth in desol citi and in hous which no man
inhabiteth which are readi to becom heap

15:29 he shall not be rich neither shall hi substanc continu
neither shall he prolong the perfect thereof upon the earth

15:30 he shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dri up hi
branch and by the breath of hi mouth shall he go away

15:31 let not him that is deceiv trust in vanity: for vaniti shall
be hi recomp

15:32 it shall be accomplish befor hi time and hi branch shall
not be green

15:33 he shall shake off hi unrip grape as the vine and shall cast
off hi flower as the oliv

15:34 for the congreg of hypocrit shall be desol and fire
shall consum the tabernacl of briberi

15:35 they conceiv mischief and bring forth vaniti and their belli
prepareth deceit

16:1 then job answer and said 16:2 i have heard mani such things:
miser comfort are ye all

16:3 shall vain word have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest? 16:4 i also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my
soul stead i could heap up word against you and shake mine head
at you

16:5 but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the move of my
lip should asswag your grief

16:6 though i speak my grief is not asswaged: and though i forbear
what am i eased? 16:7 but now he hath made me weary: thou hast made
desol all my compani

16:8 and thou hast fill me with wrinkl which is a wit against
me: and my lean rise up in me beareth wit to my face

16:9 he teareth me in hi wrath who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
with hi teeth; mine enemi sharpeneth hi eye upon me

16:10 they have gape upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gather themselv togeth
against me

16:11 god hath deliv me to the ungodli and turn me over into
the hand of the wick

16:12 i wa at eas but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken
me by my neck and shaken me to piec and set me up for hi mark

16:13 hi archer compass me round about he cleaveth my rein
asund and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground

16:14 he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like
a giant

16:15 i have sew sackcloth upon my skin and defil my horn in the
dust

16:16 my face is foul with weep and on my eyelid is the shadow of
death; 16:17 not for ani injustic in mine hands: also my prayer is
pure

16:18 o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cri have no place

16:19 also now behold my wit is in heaven and my record is on
high

16:20 my friend scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tear unto god

16:21 o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for
hi neighbour! 16:22 when a few year are come then i shall go the
way whenc i shall not return

17:1 my breath is corrupt my day are extinct the grave are readi
for me

17:2 are there not mocker with me? and doth not mine eye continu in
their provocation? 17:3 lay down now put me in a sureti with thee;
who is he that will strike hand with me? 17:4 for thou hast hid
their heart from understanding: therefor shalt thou not exalt them

17:5 he that speaketh flatteri to hi friend even the eye of hi
children shall fail

17:6 he hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetim i wa
as a tabret

17:7 mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my member are
as a shadow

17:8 upright men shall be astoni at thi and the innoc shall
stir up himself against the hypocrit

17:9 the righteou also shall hold on hi way and he that hath clean
hand shall be stronger and stronger

17:10 but as for you all do ye return and come now: for i cannot
find one wise man among you

17:11 my day are past my purpos are broken off even the thought
of my heart

17:12 they chang the night into day: the light is short becaus of
dark

17:13 if i wait the grave is mine house: i have made my bed in the
dark

17:14 i have said to corrupt thou art my father: to the worm thou
art my mother and my sister

17:15 and where is now my hope? as for my hope who shall see it?
17:16 they shall go down to the bar of the pit when our rest
togeth is in the dust

18:1 then answer bildad the shuhit and said 18:2 how long will it
be ere ye make an end of words? mark and afterward we will speak

18:3 wherefor are we count as beast and reput vile in your
sight? 18:4 he teareth himself in hi anger: shall the earth be
forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be remov out of hi place?
18:5 yea the light of the wick shall be put out and the spark of
hi fire shall not shine

18:6 the light shall be dark in hi tabernacl and hi candl shall
be put out with him

18:7 the step of hi strength shall be straiten and hi own
counsel shall cast him down

18:8 for he is cast into a net by hi own feet and he walketh upon a
snare

18:9 the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail
against him

18:10 the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in
the way

18:11 terror shall make him afraid on everi side and shall drive him
to hi feet

18:12 hi strength shall be hungerbitten and destruct shall be
readi at hi side

18:13 it shall devour the strength of hi skin: even the firstborn of
death shall devour hi strength

18:14 hi confid shall be root out of hi tabernacl and it
shall bring him to the king of terror

18:15 it shall dwell in hi tabernacl becaus it is none of his:
brimston shall be scatter upon hi habit

18:16 hi root shall be dri up beneath and abov shall hi branch
be cut off

18:17 hi remembr shall perish from the earth and he shall have
no name in the street

18:18 he shall be driven from light into dark and chase out of
the world

18:19 he shall neither have son nor nephew among hi peopl nor ani
remain in hi dwell

18:20 they that come after him shall be astoni at hi day as they
that went befor were affright

18:21 sure such are the dwell of the wick and thi is the
place of him that knoweth not god

19:1 then job answer and said 19:2 how long will ye vex my soul
and break me in piec with words? 19:3 these ten time have ye
reproach me: ye are not asham that ye make yourselv strang to
me

19:4 and be it inde that i have er mine error remaineth with
myself

19:5 if inde ye will magnifi yourselv against me and plead
against me my reproach: 19:6 know now that god hath overthrown me and
hath compass me with hi net

19:7 behold i cri out of wrong but i am not heard: i cri aloud but
there is no judgment

19:8 he hath fenc up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set
dark in my path

19:9 he hath strip me of my glori and taken the crown from my
head

19:10 he hath destroy me on everi side and i am gone: and mine hope
hath he remov like a tree

19:11 he hath also kindl hi wrath against me and he counteth me
unto him as one of hi enemi

19:12 hi troop come togeth and rais up their way against me and
encamp round about my tabernacl

19:13 he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaint are
verili estrang from me

19:14 my kinsfolk have fail and my familiar friend have forgotten
me

19:15 they that dwell in mine hous and my maid count me for a
stranger: i am an alien in their sight

19:16 i call my servant and he gave me no answer; i intreat him
with my mouth

19:17 my breath is strang to my wife though i intreat for the
children sake of mine own bodi

19:18 yea young children despis me; i aros and they spake against
me

19:19 all my inward friend abhor me: and they whom i love are
turn against me

19:20 my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escap
with the skin of my teeth

19:21 have piti upon me have piti upon me o ye my friends; for the
hand of god hath touch me

19:22 whi do ye persecut me as god and are not satisfi with my
flesh? 19:23 oh that my word were now written! oh that they were
print in a book! 19:24 that they were graven with an iron pen and
lead in the rock for ever! 19:25 for i know that my redeem liveth
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 19:26 and
though after my skin worm destroy thi bodi yet in my flesh shall i
see god: 19:27 whom i shall see for myself and mine eye shall
behold and not another; though my rein be consum within me

19:28 but ye should say whi persecut we him see the root of the
matter is found in me? 19:29 be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath
bringeth the punish of the sword that ye may know there is a
judgment

20:1 then answer zophar the naamathit and said 20:2 therefor do
my thought caus me to answer and for thi i make hast

20:3 i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my
understand causeth me to answer

20:4 knowest thou not thi of old sinc man wa place upon earth
20:5 that the triumph of the wick is short and the joy of the
hypocrit but for a moment? 20:6 though hi excel mount up to
the heaven and hi head reach unto the clouds; 20:7 yet he shall
perish for ever like hi own dung: they which have seen him shall say
where is he? 20:8 he shall fli away as a dream and shall not be
found: yea he shall be chase away as a vision of the night

20:9 the eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall
hi place ani more behold him

20:10 hi children shall seek to pleas the poor and hi hand shall
restor their good

20:11 hi bone are full of the sin of hi youth which shall lie down
with him in the dust

20:12 though wicked be sweet in hi mouth though he hide it under
hi tongue; 20:13 though he spare it and forsak it not; but keep it
still within hi mouth: 20:14 yet hi meat in hi bowel is turn it
is the gall of asp within him

20:15 he hath swallow down rich and he shall vomit them up again:
god shall cast them out of hi belli

20:16 he shall suck the poison of asps: the viper tongu shall slay
him

20:17 he shall not see the river the flood the brook of honey and
butter

20:18 that which he labour for shall he restor and shall not
swallow it down: accord to hi substanc shall the restitut be
and he shall not rejoic therein

20:19 becaus he hath oppress and hath forsaken the poor; becaus he
hath violent taken away an hous which he build not; 20:20 sure
he shall not feel quiet in hi belli he shall not save of that
which he desir

20:21 there shall none of hi meat be left; therefor shall no man
look for hi good

20:22 in the ful of hi suffici he shall be in straits: everi
hand of the wick shall come upon him

20:23 when he is about to fill hi belli god shall cast the furi of
hi wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eat

20:24 he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall
strike him through

20:25 it is drawn and cometh out of the body; yea the glitter
sword cometh out of hi gall: terror are upon him

20:26 all dark shall be hid in hi secret places: a fire not blown
shall consum him; it shall go ill with him that is left in hi
tabernacl

20:27 the heaven shall reveal hi iniquity; and the earth shall rise
up against him

20:28 the increas of hi hous shall depart and hi good shall flow
away in the day of hi wrath

20:29 thi is the portion of a wick man from god and the heritag
appoint unto him by god

21:1 but job answer and said 21:2 hear dilig my speech and
let thi be your consol

21:3 suffer me that i may speak; and after that i have spoken mock
on

21:4 as for me is my complaint to man? and if it were so whi should
not my spirit be troubled? 21:5 mark me and be astonish and lay
your hand upon your mouth

21:6 even when i rememb i am afraid and trembl taketh hold on my
flesh

21:7 wherefor do the wick live becom old yea are mighti in
power? 21:8 their seed is establish in their sight with them and
their offspr befor their eye

21:9 their hous are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon
them

21:10 their bull gendereth and faileth not; their cow calveth and
casteth not her calf

21:11 they send forth their littl one like a flock and their
children danc

21:12 they take the timbrel and harp and rejoic at the sound of the
organ

21:13 they spend their day in wealth and in a moment go down to the
grave

21:14 therefor they say unto god depart from us; for we desir not
the knowledg of thi way

21:15 what is the almighti that we should serv him? and what profit
should we have if we pray unto him? 21:16 lo their good is not in
their hand: the counsel of the wick is far from me

21:17 how oft is the candl of the wick put out! and how oft cometh
their destruct upon them! god distributeth sorrow in hi anger

21:18 they are as stubbl befor the wind and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away

21:19 god layeth up hi iniqu for hi children: he rewardeth him
and he shall know it

21:20 hi eye shall see hi destruct and he shall drink of the
wrath of the almighti

21:21 for what pleasur hath he in hi hous after him when the
number of hi month is cut off in the midst? 21:22 shall ani teach
god knowledge? see he judgeth those that are high

21:23 one dieth in hi full strength be wholli at eas and quiet

21:24 hi breast are full of milk and hi bone are moisten with
marrow

21:25 and anoth dieth in the bitter of hi soul and never
eateth with pleasur

21:26 they shall lie down alik in the dust and the worm shall cover
them

21:27 behold i know your thought and the devic which ye
wrong imagin against me

21:28 for ye say where is the hous of the prince? and where are the
dwell place of the wicked? 21:29 have ye not ask them that go
by the way? and do ye not know their token 21:30 that the wick is
reserv to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the
day of wrath

21:31 who shall declar hi way to hi face? and who shall repay him
what he hath done? 21:32 yet shall he be brought to the grave and
shall remain in the tomb

21:33 the clod of the valley shall be sweet unto him and everi man
shall draw after him as there are innumer befor him

21:34 how then comfort ye me in vain see in your answer there
remaineth falsehood? 22:1 then eliphaz the temanit answer and
said 22:2 can a man be profit unto god as he that is wise may be
profit unto himself? 22:3 is it ani pleasur to the almighti
that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thi
way perfect? 22:4 will he reprov thee for fear of thee? will he
enter with thee into judgment? 22:5 is not thi wicked great? and
thine iniqu infinite? 22:6 for thou hast taken a pledg from thi
brother for nought and strip the nake of their cloth

22:7 thou hast not given water to the weari to drink and thou hast
withholden bread from the hungri

22:8 but as for the mighti man he had the earth; and the honour
man dwelt in it

22:9 thou hast sent widow away empti and the arm of the fatherless
have been broken

22:10 therefor snare are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth
thee; 22:11 or dark that thou canst not see; and abund of
water cover thee

22:12 is not god in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
star how high they are! 22:13 and thou sayest how doth god know?
can he judg through the dark cloud? 22:14 thick cloud are a
cover to him that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of
heaven

22:15 hast thou mark the old way which wick men have trodden?
22:16 which were cut down out of time whose foundat wa overflown
with a flood: 22:17 which said unto god depart from us: and what can
the almighti do for them? 22:18 yet he fill their hous with good
things: but the counsel of the wick is far from me

22:19 the righteou see it and are glad: and the innoc laugh them
to scorn

22:20 wherea our substanc is not cut down but the remnant of them
the fire consumeth

22:21 acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace: therebi good
shall come unto thee

22:22 receiv i pray thee the law from hi mouth and lay up hi
word in thine heart

22:23 if thou return to the almighti thou shalt be built up thou
shalt put away iniqu far from thi tabernacl

22:24 then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as
the stone of the brook

22:25 yea the almighti shall be thi defenc and thou shalt have
plenti of silver

22:26 for then shalt thou have thi delight in the almighti and shalt
lift up thi face unto god

22:27 thou shalt make thi prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and
thou shalt pay thi vow

22:28 thou shalt also decre a thing and it shall be establish unto
thee: and the light shall shine upon thi way

22:29 when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lift
up; and he shall save the humbl person

22:30 he shall deliv the island of the innocent: and it is deliv
by the pure of thine hand

23:1 then job answer and said 23:2 even to day is my complaint
bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groan

23:3 oh that i knew where i might find him! that i might come even to
hi seat! 23:4 i would order my caus befor him and fill my mouth
with argument

23:5 i would know the word which he would answer me and understand
what he would say unto me

23:6 will he plead against me with hi great power? no; but he would
put strength in me

23:7 there the righteou might disput with him; so should i be
deliv for ever from my judg

23:8 behold i go forward but he is not there; and backward but i
cannot perceiv him: 23:9 on the left hand where he doth work but i
cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot
see him: 23:10 but he knoweth the way that i take: when he hath tri
me i shall come forth as gold

23:11 my foot hath held hi step hi way have i kept and not
declin

23:12 neither have i gone back from the command of hi lips; i
have esteem the word of hi mouth more than my necessari food

23:13 but he is in one mind and who can turn him? and what hi soul
desireth even that he doeth

23:14 for he performeth the thing that is appoint for me: and mani
such thing are with him

23:15 therefor am i troubl at hi presence: when i consid i am
afraid of him

23:16 for god maketh my heart soft and the almighti troubleth me:
23:17 becaus i wa not cut off befor the dark neither hath he
cover the dark from my face

24:1 whi see time are not hidden from the almighti do they that
know him not see hi days? 24:2 some remov the landmarks; they
violent take away flock and feed thereof

24:3 they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widow
ox for a pledg

24:4 they turn the needi out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
themselv togeth

24:5 behold as wild ass in the desert go they forth to their work;
rise betim for a prey: the wilder yieldeth food for them and
for their children

24:6 they reap everi one hi corn in the field: and they gather the
vintag of the wick

24:7 they caus the nake to lodg without cloth that they have no
cover in the cold

24:8 they are wet with the shower of the mountain and embrac the
rock for want of a shelter

24:9 they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledg of
the poor

24:10 they caus him to go nake without cloth and they take away
the sheaf from the hungry; 24:11 which make oil within their wall
and tread their winepress and suffer thirst

24:12 men groan from out of the citi and the soul of the wound
crieth out: yet god layeth not folli to them

24:13 they are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
the way thereof nor abid in the path thereof

24:14 the murder rise with the light killeth the poor and needi
and in the night is as a thief

24:15 the eye also of the adulter waiteth for the twilight say
no eye shall see me: and disguiseth hi face

24:16 in the dark they dig through hous which they had mark for
themselv in the daytime: they know not the light

24:17 for the morn is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
know them they are in the terror of the shadow of death

24:18 he is swift as the waters; their portion is curs in the earth:
he beholdeth not the way of the vineyard

24:19 drought and heat consum the snow waters: so doth the grave
those which have sin

24:20 the womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetli on him;
he shall be no more remembered; and wicked shall be broken as a
tree

24:21 he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
good to the widow

24:22 he draweth also the mighti with hi power: he riseth up and no
man is sure of life

24:23 though it be given him to be in safeti whereon he resteth; yet
hi eye are upon their way

24:24 they are exalt for a littl while but are gone and brought
low; they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the
top of the ear of corn

24:25 and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my
speech noth worth? 25:1 then answer bildad the shuhit and
said 25:2 dominion and fear are with him he maketh peac in hi high
place

25:3 is there ani number of hi armies? and upon whom doth not hi
light arise? 25:4 how then can man be justifi with god? or how can
he be clean that is born of a woman? 25:5 behold even to the moon
and it shineth not; yea the star are not pure in hi sight

25:6 how much less man that is a worm? and the son of man which is a
worm? 26:1 but job answer and said 26:2 how hast thou help him
that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
26:3 how hast thou counsel him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
thou plenti declar the thing as it is? 26:4 to whom hast thou
utter words? and whose spirit came from thee? 26:5 dead thing are
form from under the water and the inhabit thereof

26:6 hell is nake befor him and destruct hath no cover

26:7 he stretcheth out the north over the empti place and hangeth the
earth upon noth

26:8 he bindeth up the water in hi thick clouds; and the cloud is
not rent under them

26:9 he holdeth back the face of hi throne and spreadeth hi cloud
upon it

26:10 he hath compass the water with bound until the day and
night come to an end

26:11 the pillar of heaven trembl and are astonish at hi reproof

26:12 he divideth the sea with hi power and by hi understand he
smiteth through the proud

26:13 by hi spirit he hath garnish the heavens; hi hand hath
form the crook serpent

26:14 lo these are part of hi ways: but how littl a portion is
heard of him? but the thunder of hi power who can understand? 27:1
moreov job continu hi parabl and said 27:2 as god liveth who
hath taken away my judgment; and the almighti who hath vex my soul;
27:3 all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my
nostrils; 27:4 my lip shall not speak wicked nor my tongu utter
deceit

27:5 god forbid that i should justifi you: till i die i will not
remov mine integr from me

27:6 my righteous i hold fast and will not let it go: my heart
shall not reproach me so long as i live

27:7 let mine enemi be as the wick and he that riseth up against me
as the unright

27:8 for what is the hope of the hypocrit though he hath gain
when god taketh away hi soul? 27:9 will god hear hi cri when
troubl cometh upon him? 27:10 will he delight himself in the
almighty? will he alway call upon god? 27:11 i will teach you by the
hand of god: that which is with the almighti will i not conceal

27:12 behold all ye yourselv have seen it; whi then are ye thu
altogeth vain? 27:13 thi is the portion of a wick man with god
and the heritag of oppressor which they shall receiv of the
almighti

27:14 if hi children be multipli it is for the sword: and hi
offspr shall not be satisfi with bread

27:15 those that remain of him shall be buri in death: and hi
widow shall not weep

27:16 though he heap up silver as the dust and prepar raiment as the
clay; 27:17 he may prepar it but the just shall put it on and the
innoc shall divid the silver

27:18 he buildeth hi hous as a moth and as a booth that the keeper
maketh

27:19 the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered: he
openeth hi eye and he is not

27:20 terror take hold on him as water a tempest stealeth him away
in the night

27:21 the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth: and as a
storm hurleth him out of hi place

27:22 for god shall cast upon him and not spare: he would fain flee
out of hi hand

27:23 men shall clap their hand at him and shall hiss him out of hi
place

28:1 sure there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where
they fine it

28:2 iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the
stone

28:3 he setteth an end to dark and searcheth out all perfection:
the stone of dark and the shadow of death

28:4 the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the water
forgotten of the foot: they are dri up they are gone away from men

28:5 as for the earth out of it cometh bread: and under it is turn
up as it were fire

28:6 the stone of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of
gold

28:7 there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultur
eye hath not seen: 28:8 the lion whelp have not trodden it nor the
fierc lion pass by it

28:9 he putteth forth hi hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
mountain by the root

28:10 he cutteth out river among the rocks; and hi eye seeth everi
preciou thing

28:11 he bindeth the flood from overflowing; and the thing that is
hid bringeth he forth to light

28:12 but where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
understanding? 28:13 man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it
found in the land of the live

28:14 the depth saith it is not in me: and the sea saith it is not
with me

28:15 it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weigh
for the price thereof

28:16 it cannot be valu with the gold of ophir with the preciou
onyx or the sapphir

28:17 the gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchang of it
shall not be for jewel of fine gold

28:18 no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls: for the price
of wisdom is abov rubi

28:19 the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be
valu with pure gold

28:20 whenc then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
understanding? 28:21 see it is hid from the eye of all live
and kept close from the fowl of the air

28:22 destruct and death say we have heard the fame thereof with
our ear

28:23 god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place
thereof

28:24 for he looketh to the end of the earth and seeth under the
whole heaven; 28:25 to make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth
the water by measur

28:26 when he made a decre for the rain and a way for the lightn
of the thunder: 28:27 then did he see it and declar it; he prepar
it yea and search it out

28:28 and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is
wisdom; and to depart from evil is understand

29:1 moreov job continu hi parabl and said 29:2 oh that i were
as in month past as in the day when god preserv me; 29:3 when hi
candl shine upon my head and when by hi light i walk through
darkness; 29:4 as i wa in the day of my youth when the secret of
god wa upon my tabernacle; 29:5 when the almighti wa yet with me
when my children were about me; 29:6 when i wash my step with
butter and the rock pour me out river of oil; 29:7 when i went out
to the gate through the citi when i prepar my seat in the street!
29:8 the young men saw me and hid themselves: and the age aros and
stood up

29:9 the princ refrain talk and laid their hand on their
mouth

29:10 the nobl held their peac and their tongu cleav to the
roof of their mouth

29:11 when the ear heard me then it bless me; and when the eye saw
me it gave wit to me: 29:12 becaus i deliv the poor that
cri and the fatherless and him that had none to help him

29:13 the bless of him that wa readi to perish came upon me: and i
caus the widow heart to sing for joy

29:14 i put on righteous and it cloth me: my judgment wa as a
robe and a diadem

29:15 i wa eye to the blind and feet wa i to the lame

29:16 i wa a father to the poor: and the caus which i knew not i
search out

29:17 and i brake the jaw of the wick and pluck the spoil out of
hi teeth

29:18 then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multipli my
day as the sand

29:19 my root wa spread out by the water and the dew lay all night
upon my branch

29:20 my glori wa fresh in me and my bow wa renew in my hand

29:21 unto me men gave ear and wait and kept silenc at my
counsel

29:22 after my word they spake not again; and my speech drop upon
them

29:23 and they wait for me as for the rain; and they open their
mouth wide as for the latter rain

29:24 if i laugh on them they believ it not; and the light of my
counten they cast not down

29:25 i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the
armi as one that comforteth the mourner

30:1 but now they that are younger than i have me in deris whose
father i would have disdain to have set with the dog of my flock

30:2 yea whereto might the strength of their hand profit me in whom
old age wa perished? 30:3 for want and famin they were solitary;
flee into the wilder in former time desol and wast

30:4 who cut up mallow by the bush and junip root for their
meat

30:5 they were driven forth from among men (they cri after them as
after a thief;) 30:6 to dwell in the cliff of the valley in cave
of the earth and in the rock

30:7 among the bush they brayed; under the nettl they were
gather togeth

30:8 they were children of fool yea children of base men: they were
viler than the earth

30:9 and now am i their song yea i am their byword

30:10 they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in
my face

30:11 becaus he hath loos my cord and afflict me they have also
let loos the bridl befor me

30:12 upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet and
they rais up against me the way of their destruct

30:13 they mar my path they set forward my calam they have no
helper

30:14 they came upon me as a wide break in of waters: in the
desol they roll themselv upon me

30:15 terror are turn upon me: they pursu my soul as the wind: and
my welfar passeth away as a cloud

30:16 and now my soul is pour out upon me; the day of afflict
have taken hold upon me

30:17 my bone are pierc in me in the night season: and my sinew
take no rest

30:18 by the great forc of my diseas is my garment changed: it
bindeth me about as the collar of my coat

30:19 he hath cast me into the mire and i am becom like dust and
ash

30:20 i cri unto thee and thou dost not hear me: i stand up and thou
regardest me not

30:21 thou art becom cruel to me: with thi strong hand thou opposest
thyself against me

30:22 thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it
and dissolvest my substanc

30:23 for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the hous
appoint for all live

30:24 howbeit he will not stretch out hi hand to the grave though
they cri in hi destruct

30:25 did not i weep for him that wa in trouble? wa not my soul
griev for the poor? 30:26 when i look for good then evil came
unto me: and when i wait for light there came dark

30:27 my bowel boil and rest not: the day of afflict
prevent me

30:28 i went mourn without the sun: i stood up and i cri in the
congreg

30:29 i am a brother to dragon and a companion to owl

30:30 my skin is black upon me and my bone are burn with heat

30:31 my harp also is turn to mourn and my organ into the voic
of them that weep

31:1 i made a coven with mine eyes; whi then should i think upon a
maid? 31:2 for what portion of god is there from above? and what
inherit of the almighti from on high? 31:3 is not destruct to
the wicked? and a strang punish to the worker of iniquity? 31:4
doth not he see my way and count all my steps? 31:5 if i have
walk with vaniti or if my foot hath hast to deceit; 31:6 let me
be weigh in an even balanc that god may know mine integr

31:7 if my step hath turn out of the way and mine heart walk
after mine eye and if ani blot hath cleav to mine hands; 31:8 then
let me sow and let anoth eat; yea let my offspr be root out

31:9 if mine heart have been deceiv by a woman or if i have laid
wait at my neighbour door; 31:10 then let my wife grind unto
anoth and let other bow down upon her

31:11 for thi is an heinou crime; yea it is an iniqu to be
punish by the judg

31:12 for it is a fire that consumeth to destruct and would root
out all mine increas

31:13 if i did despis the caus of my manserv or of my
maidserv when they contend with me; 31:14 what then shall i do
when god riseth up? and when he visiteth what shall i answer him?
31:15 did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
fashion us in the womb? 31:16 if i have withheld the poor from their
desir or have caus the eye of the widow to fail; 31:17 or have
eaten my morsel myself alon and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof; 31:18 (for from my youth he wa brought up with me as with a
father and i have guid her from my mother womb;) 31:19 if i have
seen ani perish for want of cloth or ani poor without covering;
31:20 if hi loin have not bless me and if he were not warm with
the fleec of my sheep; 31:21 if i have lift up my hand against the
fatherless when i saw my help in the gate: 31:22 then let mine arm
fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone

31:23 for destruct from god wa a terror to me and by reason of
hi high i could not endur

31:24 if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou
art my confidence; 31:25 if i rejoic becaus my wealth wa great and
becaus mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 if i beheld the sun when it
shine or the moon walk in brightness; 31:27 and my heart hath
been secretli entic or my mouth hath kiss my hand: 31:28 thi
also were an iniqu to be punish by the judge: for i should have
deni the god that is abov

31:29 if i rejoic at the destruct of him that hate me or lift
up myself when evil found him: 31:30 neither have i suffer my mouth
to sin by wish a curs to hi soul

31:31 if the men of my tabernacl said not oh that we had of hi
flesh! we cannot be satisfi

31:32 the stranger did not lodg in the street: but i open my door
to the travel

31:33 if i cover my transgress as adam by hide mine iniqu
in my bosom: 31:34 did i fear a great multitud or did the contempt
of famili terrifi me that i kept silenc and went not out of the
door? 31:35 oh that one would hear me! behold my desir is that the
almighti would answer me and that mine adversari had written a book

31:36 sure i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown
to me

31:37 i would declar unto him the number of my steps; as a princ
would i go near unto him

31:38 if my land cri against me or that the furrow likewis thereof
complain; 31:39 if i have eaten the fruit thereof without money or
have caus the owner thereof to lose their life: 31:40 let thistl
grow instead of wheat and cockl instead of barley

the word of job are end

32:1 so these three men ceas to answer job becaus he wa righteou
in hi own eye

32:2 then wa kindl the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the
buzit of the kindr of ram: against job wa hi wrath kindl
becaus he justifi himself rather than god

32:3 also against hi three friend wa hi wrath kindl becaus
they had found no answer and yet had condemn job

32:4 now elihu had wait till job had spoken becaus they were elder
than he

32:5 when elihu saw that there wa no answer in the mouth of these
three men then hi wrath wa kindl

32:6 and elihu the son of barachel the buzit answer and said i am
young and ye are veri old; wherefor i wa afraid and durst not shew
you mine opinion

32:7 i said day should speak and multitud of year should teach
wisdom

32:8 but there is a spirit in man: and the inspir of the almighti
giveth them understand

32:9 great men are not alway wise: neither do the age understand
judgment

32:10 therefor i said hearken to me; i also will shew mine opinion

32:11 behold i wait for your words; i gave ear to your reason
whilst ye search out what to say

32:12 yea i attend unto you and behold there wa none of you
that convinc job or that answer hi words: 32:13 lest ye should
say we have found out wisdom: god thrusteth him down not man

32:14 now he hath not direct hi word against me: neither will i
answer him with your speech

32:15 they were amaz they answer no more: they left off speak

32:16 when i had wait (for they spake not but stood still and
answer no more;) 32:17 i said i will answer also my part i also
will shew mine opinion

32:18 for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me

32:19 behold my belli is as wine which hath no vent; it is readi to
burst like new bottl

32:20 i will speak that i may be refreshed: i will open my lip and
answer

32:21 let me not i pray you accept ani man person neither let me
give flatter titl unto man

32:22 for i know not to give flatter titles; in so do my maker
would soon take me away

33:1 wherefor job i pray thee hear my speech and hearken to all
my word

33:2 behold now i have open my mouth my tongu hath spoken in my
mouth

33:3 my word shall be of the upright of my heart: and my lip
shall utter knowledg clearli

33:4 the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighti
hath given me life

33:5 if thou canst answer me set thi word in order befor me stand
up

33:6 behold i am accord to thi wish in god stead: i also am
form out of the clay

33:7 behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my
hand be heavi upon thee

33:8 sure thou hast spoken in mine hear and i have heard the
voic of thi word say 33:9 i am clean without transgress i
am innocent; neither is there iniqu in me

33:10 behold he findeth occas against me he counteth me for hi
enemi 33:11 he putteth my feet in the stock he marketh all my
path

33:12 behold in thi thou art not just: i will answer thee that god
is greater than man

33:13 whi dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
ani of hi matter

33:14 for god speaketh onc yea twice yet man perceiveth it not

33:15 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth
upon men in slumber upon the bed; 33:16 then he openeth the ear
of men and sealeth their instruct 33:17 that he may withdraw man
from hi purpos and hide pride from man

33:18 he keepeth back hi soul from the pit and hi life from
perish by the sword

33:19 he is chasten also with pain upon hi bed and the multitud
of hi bone with strong pain: 33:20 so that hi life abhorreth bread
and hi soul dainti meat

33:21 hi flesh is consum away that it cannot be seen; and hi
bone that were not seen stick out

33:22 yea hi soul draweth near unto the grave and hi life to the
destroy

33:23 if there be a messeng with him an interpret one among a
thousand to shew unto man hi uprightness: 33:24 then he is graciou
unto him and saith deliv him from go down to the pit: i have
found a ransom

33:25 hi flesh shall be fresher than a childs: he shall return to
the day of hi youth: 33:26 he shall pray unto god and he will be
favour unto him: and he shall see hi face with joy: for he will
render unto man hi righteous

33:27 he looketh upon men and if ani say i have sin and
pervert that which wa right and it profit me not; 33:28 he will
deliv hi soul from go into the pit and hi life shall see the
light

33:29 lo all these thing worketh god oftentim with man 33:30 to
bring back hi soul from the pit to be enlighten with the light of
the live

33:31 mark well o job hearken unto me: hold thi peac and i will
speak

33:32 if thou hast anyth to say answer me: speak for i desir to
justifi thee

33:33 if not hearken unto me: hold thi peac and i shall teach thee
wisdom

34:1 furthermor elihu answer and said 34:2 hear my word o ye
wise men; and give ear unto me ye that have knowledg

34:3 for the ear trieth word as the mouth tasteth meat

34:4 let us choos to us judgment: let us know among ourselv what is
good

34:5 for job hath said i am righteous: and god hath taken away my
judgment

34:6 should i lie against my right? my wound is incur without
transgress

34:7 what man is like job who drinketh up scorn like water? 34:8
which goeth in compani with the worker of iniqu and walketh with
wick men

34:9 for he hath said it profiteth a man noth that he should
delight himself with god

34:10 therefor hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
from god that he should do wickedness; and from the almighti that he
should commit iniqu

34:11 for the work of a man shall he render unto him and caus everi
man to find accord to hi way

34:12 yea sure god will not do wickedli neither will the almighti
pervert judgment

34:13 who hath given him a charg over the earth? or who hath dispos
the whole world? 34:14 if he set hi heart upon man if he gather
unto himself hi spirit and hi breath; 34:15 all flesh shall perish
togeth and man shall turn again unto dust

34:16 if now thou hast understand hear this: hearken to the voic
of my word

34:17 shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
him that is most just? 34:18 is it fit to say to a king thou art
wicked? and to princ ye are ungodly? 34:19 how much less to him
that accepteth not the person of princ nor regardeth the rich more
than the poor? for they all are the work of hi hand

34:20 in a moment shall they die and the peopl shall be troubl at
midnight and pass away: and the mighti shall be taken away without
hand

34:21 for hi eye are upon the way of man and he seeth all hi
go

34:22 there is no dark nor shadow of death where the worker of
iniqu may hide themselv

34:23 for he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
enter into judgment with god

34:24 he shall break in piec mighti men without number and set
other in their stead

34:25 therefor he knoweth their work and he overturneth them in the
night so that they are destroy

34:26 he striketh them as wick men in the open sight of others;
34:27 becaus they turn back from him and would not consid ani of
hi ways: 34:28 so that they caus the cri of the poor to come unto
him and he heareth the cri of the afflict

34:29 when he giveth quiet who then can make trouble? and when he
hideth hi face who then can behold him? whether it be done against a
nation or against a man only: 34:30 that the hypocrit reign not
lest the peopl be ensnar

34:31 sure it is meet to be said unto god i have born
chastis i will not offend ani more: 34:32 that which i see not
teach thou me: if i have done iniqu i will do no more

34:33 should it be accord to thi mind? he will recompens it
whether thou refus or whether thou choose; and not i: therefor
speak what thou knowest

34:34 let men of understand tell me and let a wise man hearken
unto me

34:35 job hath spoken without knowledg and hi word were without
wisdom

34:36 my desir is that job may be tri unto the end becaus of hi
answer for wick men

34:37 for he addeth rebellion unto hi sin he clappeth hi hand
among us and multiplieth hi word against god

35:1 elihu spake moreov and said 35:2 thinkest thou thi to be
right that thou saidst my righteous is more than gods? 35:3
for thou saidst what advantag will it be unto thee? and what profit
shall i have if i be cleans from my sin? 35:4 i will answer thee
and thi companion with thee

35:5 look unto the heaven and see; and behold the cloud which are
higher than thou

35:6 if thou sinnest what doest thou against him? or if thi
transgress be multipli what doest thou unto him? 35:7 if thou
be righteou what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine
hand? 35:8 thi wicked may hurt a man as thou art; and thi
righteous may profit the son of man

35:9 by reason of the multitud of oppress they make the oppress
to cry: they cri out by reason of the arm of the mighti

35:10 but none saith where is god my maker who giveth song in the
night; 35:11 who teacheth us more than the beast of the earth and
maketh us wiser than the fowl of heaven? 35:12 there they cri but
none giveth answer becaus of the pride of evil men

35:13 sure god will not hear vaniti neither will the almighti
regard it

35:14 although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is
befor him; therefor trust thou in him

35:15 but now becaus it is not so he hath visit in hi anger; yet
he knoweth it not in great extremity: 35:16 therefor doth job open
hi mouth in vain; he multiplieth word without knowledg

36:1 elihu also proceed and said 36:2 suffer me a littl and i
will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god behalf

36:3 i will fetch my knowledg from afar and will ascrib
righteous to my maker

36:4 for truli my word shall not be false: he that is perfect in
knowledg is with thee

36:5 behold god is mighti and despiseth not any: he is mighti in
strength and wisdom

36:6 he preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
poor

36:7 he withdraweth not hi eye from the righteous: but with king
are they on the throne; yea he doth establish them for ever and they
are exalt

36:8 and if they be bound in fetter and be holden in cord of
affliction; 36:9 then he sheweth them their work and their
transgress that they have exceed

36:10 he openeth also their ear to disciplin and commandeth that
they return from iniqu

36:11 if they obey and serv him they shall spend their day in
prosper and their year in pleasur

36:12 but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they
shall die without knowledg

36:13 but the hypocrit in heart heap up wrath: they cri not when he
bindeth them

36:14 they die in youth and their life is among the unclean

36:15 he delivereth the poor in hi afflict and openeth their ear
in oppress

36:16 even so would he have remov thee out of the strait into a
broad place where there is no straitness; and that which should be
set on thi tabl should be full of fat

36:17 but thou hast fulfil the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
justic take hold on thee

36:18 becaus there is wrath bewar lest he take thee away with hi
stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliv thee

36:19 will he esteem thi riches? no not gold nor all the forc of
strength

36:20 desir not the night when peopl are cut off in their place

36:21 take heed regard not iniquity: for thi hast thou chosen rather
than afflict

36:22 behold god exalteth by hi power: who teacheth like him? 36:23
who hath enjoin him hi way? or who can say thou hast wrought
iniquity? 36:24 rememb that thou magnifi hi work which men
behold

36:25 everi man may see it; man may behold it afar off

36:26 behold god is great and we know him not neither can the
number of hi year be search out

36:27 for he maketh small the drop of water: they pour down rain
accord to the vapour thereof: 36:28 which the cloud do drop and
distil upon man abundantli

36:29 also can ani understand the spread of the cloud or the
nois of hi tabernacle? 36:30 behold he spreadeth hi light upon
it and covereth the bottom of the sea

36:31 for by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abund

36:32 with cloud he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt

36:33 the nois thereof sheweth concern it the cattl also
concern the vapour

37:1 at thi also my heart trembleth and is move out of hi place

37:2 hear attent the nois of hi voic and the sound that goeth
out of hi mouth

37:3 he directeth it under the whole heaven and hi lightn unto
the end of the earth

37:4 after it a voic roareth: he thundereth with the voic of hi
excellency; and he will not stay them when hi voic is heard

37:5 god thundereth marvel with hi voice; great thing doeth
he which we cannot comprehend

37:6 for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth; likewis to the
small rain and to the great rain of hi strength

37:7 he sealeth up the hand of everi man; that all men may know hi
work

37:8 then the beast go into den and remain in their place

37:9 out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north

37:10 by the breath of god frost is given: and the breadth of the
water is straiten

37:11 also by water he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth hi
bright cloud: 37:12 and it is turn round about by hi counsels: that
they may do whatsoev he commandeth them upon the face of the world
in the earth

37:13 he causeth it to come whether for correct or for hi land
or for merci

37:14 hearken unto thi o job: stand still and consid the wondrou
work of god

37:15 dost thou know when god dispos them and caus the light of
hi cloud to shine? 37:16 dost thou know the balanc of the
cloud the wondrou work of him which is perfect in knowledge?
37:17 how thi garment are warm when he quieteth the earth by the
south wind? 37:18 hast thou with him spread out the sky which is
strong and as a molten look glass? 37:19 teach us what we shall
say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of dark

37:20 shall it be told him that i speak? if a man speak sure he
shall be swallow up

37:21 and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but
the wind passeth and cleanseth them

37:22 fair weather cometh out of the north: with god is terribl
majesti

37:23 touch the almighti we cannot find him out: he is excel
in power and in judgment and in plenti of justice: he will not
afflict

37:24 men do therefor fear him: he respecteth not ani that are wise
of heart

38:1 then the lord answer job out of the whirlwind and said 38:2
who is thi that darkeneth counsel by word without knowledge? 38:3
gird up now thi loin like a man; for i will demand of thee and
answer thou me

38:4 where wast thou when i laid the foundat of the earth?
declar if thou hast understand

38:5 who hath laid the measur thereof if thou knowest? or who hath
stretch the line upon it? 38:6 whereupon are the foundat
thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 38:7 when the
morn star sang togeth and all the son of god shout for joy?
38:8 or who shut up the sea with door when it brake forth as if it
had issu out of the womb? 38:9 when i made the cloud the garment
thereof and thick dark a swaddlingband for it 38:10 and brake up
for it my decre place and set bar and door 38:11 and said
hitherto shalt thou come but no further: and here shall thi proud
wave be stayed? 38:12 hast thou command the morn sinc thi
days; and caus the dayspr to know hi place; 38:13 that it might
take hold of the end of the earth that the wick might be shaken
out of it? 38:14 it is turn as clay to the seal; and they stand as
a garment

38:15 and from the wick their light is withholden and the high arm
shall be broken

38:16 hast thou enter into the spring of the sea? or hast thou
walk in the search of the depth? 38:17 have the gate of death been
open unto thee? or hast thou seen the door of the shadow of death?
38:18 hast thou perceiv the breadth of the earth? declar if thou
knowest it all

38:19 where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for dark
where is the place thereof 38:20 that thou shouldest take it to the
bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the path to the hous
thereof? 38:21 knowest thou it becaus thou wast then born? or
becaus the number of thi day is great? 38:22 hast thou enter into
the treasur of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasur of the
hail 38:23 which i have reserv against the time of troubl against
the day of battl and war? 38:24 by what way is the light part
which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 38:25 who hath divid
a watercours for the overflow of water or a way for the
lightn of thunder; 38:26 to caus it to rain on the earth where no
man is; on the wilder wherein there is no man; 38:27 to satisfi
the desol and wast ground; and to caus the bud of the tender herb
to spring forth? 38:28 hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten
the drop of dew? 38:29 out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoari
frost of heaven who hath gender it? 38:30 the water are hid as
with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen

38:31 canst thou bind the sweet influenc of pleiad or loos the
band of orion? 38:32 canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in hi season?
or canst thou guid arcturu with hi sons? 38:33 knowest thou the
ordin of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the
earth? 38:34 canst thou lift up thi voic to the cloud that
abund of water may cover thee? 38:35 canst thou send lightn
that they may go and say unto thee here we are? 38:36 who hath put
wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understand to the
heart? 38:37 who can number the cloud in wisdom? or who can stay the
bottl of heaven 38:38 when the dust groweth into hard and the
clod cleav fast together? 38:39 wilt thou hunt the prey for the
lion? or fill the appetit of the young lion 38:40 when they couch
in their den and abid in the covert to lie in wait? 38:41 who
provideth for the raven hi food? when hi young one cri unto god
they wander for lack of meat

39:1 knowest thou the time when the wild goat of the rock bring
forth? or canst thou mark when the hind do calve? 39:2 canst thou
number the month that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they
bring forth? 39:3 they bow themselv they bring forth their young
one they cast out their sorrow

39:4 their young one are in good like they grow up with corn; they
go forth and return not unto them

39:5 who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loos the band
of the wild ass? 39:6 whose hous i have made the wilder and the
barren land hi dwell

39:7 he scorneth the multitud of the citi neither regardeth he the
cri of the driver

39:8 the rang of the mountain is hi pastur and he searcheth after
everi green thing

39:9 will the unicorn be will to serv thee or abid by thi crib?
39:10 canst thou bind the unicorn with hi band in the furrow? or will
he harrow the valley after thee? 39:11 wilt thou trust him becaus
hi strength is great? or wilt thou leav thi labour to him? 39:12
wilt thou believ him that he will bring home thi seed and gather it
into thi barn? 39:13 gavest thou the goodli wing unto the peacocks?
or wing and feather unto the ostrich? 39:14 which leaveth her egg
in the earth and warmeth them in dust 39:15 and forgetteth that the
foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them

39:16 she is harden against her young one as though they were not
hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 39:17 becaus god hath
depriv her of wisdom neither hath he impart to her understand

39:18 what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the hors
and hi rider

39:19 hast thou given the hors strength? hast thou cloth hi neck
with thunder? 39:20 canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the
glori of hi nostril is terribl

39:21 he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in hi strength: he goeth
on to meet the arm men

39:22 he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
back from the sword

39:23 the quiver rattleth against him the glitter spear and the
shield

39:24 he swalloweth the ground with fierc and rage: neither
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet

39:25 he saith among the trumpet ha ha; and he smelleth the battl
afar off the thunder of the captain and the shout

39:26 doth the hawk fli by thi wisdom and stretch her wing toward
the south? 39:27 doth the eagl mount up at thi command and make her
nest on high? 39:28 she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the
crag of the rock and the strong place

39:29 from thenc she seeketh the prey and her eye behold afar off

39:30 her young one also suck up blood: and where the slain are
there is she

40:1 moreov the lord answer job and said 40:2 shall he that
contendeth with the almighti instruct him? he that reproveth god let
him answer it

40:3 then job answer the lord and said 40:4 behold i am vile;
what shall i answer thee? i will lay mine hand upon my mouth

40:5 onc have i spoken; but i will not answer: yea twice; but i will
proceed no further

40:6 then answer the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said
40:7 gird up thi loin now like a man: i will demand of thee and
declar thou unto me

40:8 wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that
thou mayest be righteous? 40:9 hast thou an arm like god? or canst
thou thunder with a voic like him? 40:10 deck thyself now with
majesti and excellency; and array thyself with glori and beauti

40:11 cast abroad the rage of thi wrath: and behold everi one that is
proud and abas him

40:12 look on everi one that is proud and bring him low; and tread
down the wick in their place

40:13 hide them in the dust together; and bind their face in secret

40:14 then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee

40:15 behold now behemoth which i made with thee; he eateth grass as
an ox

40:16 lo now hi strength is in hi loin and hi forc is in the
navel of hi belli

40:17 he moveth hi tail like a cedar: the sinew of hi stone are
wrap togeth

40:18 hi bone are as strong piec of brass; hi bone are like bar
of iron

40:19 he is the chief of the way of god: he that made him can make
hi sword to approach unto him

40:20 sure the mountain bring him forth food where all the beast
of the field play

40:21 he lieth under the shadi tree in the covert of the reed and
fen

40:22 the shadi tree cover him with their shadow; the willow of the
brook compass him about

40:23 behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not: he trusteth
that he can draw up jordan into hi mouth

40:24 he taketh it with hi eyes: hi nose pierceth through snare

41:1 canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or hi tongu with a
cord which thou lettest down? 41:2 canst thou put an hook into hi
nose? or bore hi jaw through with a thorn? 41:3 will he make mani
supplic unto thee? will he speak soft word unto thee? 41:4
will he make a coven with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant
for ever? 41:5 wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou
bind him for thi maidens? 41:6 shall the companion make a banquet of
him? shall they part him among the merchants? 41:7 canst thou fill
hi skin with barb irons? or hi head with fish spears? 41:8 lay
thine hand upon him rememb the battl do no more

41:9 behold the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
even at the sight of him? 41:10 none is so fierc that dare stir him
up: who then is abl to stand befor me? 41:11 who hath prevent me
that i should repay him? whatsoev is under the whole heaven is mine

41:12 i will not conceal hi part nor hi power nor hi come
proport

41:13 who can discov the face of hi garment? or who can come to him
with hi doubl bridle? 41:14 who can open the door of hi face? hi
teeth are terribl round about

41:15 hi scale are hi pride shut up togeth as with a close seal

41:16 one is so near to anoth that no air can come between them

41:17 they are join one to anoth they stick togeth that they
cannot be sunder

41:18 by hi nees a light doth shine and hi eye are like the
eyelid of the morn

41:19 out of hi mouth go burn lamp and spark of fire leap out

41:20 out of hi nostril goeth smoke as out of a seeth pot or
caldron

41:21 hi breath kindleth coal and a flame goeth out of hi mouth

41:22 in hi neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turn into joy
befor him

41:23 the flake of hi flesh are join together: they are firm in
themselves; they cannot be move

41:24 hi heart is as firm as a stone; yea as hard as a piec of the
nether millston

41:25 when he raiseth up himself the mighti are afraid: by reason of
break they purifi themselv

41:26 the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear the
dart nor the habergeon

41:27 he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood

41:28 the arrow cannot make him flee: slingston are turn with him
into stubbl

41:29 dart are count as stubble: he laugheth at the shake of a
spear

41:30 sharp stone are under him: he spreadeth sharp point thing
upon the mire

41:31 he maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a
pot of ointment

41:32 he maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to
be hoari

41:33 upon earth there is not hi like who is made without fear

41:34 he beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children
of pride

42:1 then job answer the lord and said 42:2 i know that thou canst
do everi thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee

42:3 who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefor have i
utter that i understood not; thing too wonder for me which i
knew not

42:4 hear i beseech thee and i will speak: i will demand of thee
and declar thou unto me

42:5 i have heard of thee by the hear of the ear: but now mine eye
seeth thee

42:6 wherefor i abhor myself and repent in dust and ash

42:7 and it wa so that after the lord had spoken these word unto
job the lord said to eliphaz the temanit my wrath is kindl
against thee and against thi two friends: for ye have not spoken of
me the thing that is right as my servant job hath

42:8 therefor take unto you now seven bullock and seven ram and go
to my servant job and offer up for yourselv a burnt offering; and
my servant job shall pray for you: for him will i accept: lest i deal
with you after your folli in that ye have not spoken of me the thing
which is right like my servant job

42:9 so eliphaz the temanit and bildad the shuhit and zophar the
naamathit went and did accord as the lord command them: the
lord also accept job

42:10 and the lord turn the captiv of job when he pray for hi
friends: also the lord gave job twice as much as he had befor

42:11 then came there unto him all hi brethren and all hi sister
and all they that had been of hi acquaint befor and did eat
bread with him in hi house: and they bemoan him and comfort him
over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him: everi man also
gave him a piec of money and everi one an ear of gold

42:12 so the lord bless the latter end of job more than hi
beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand
camel and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she ass

42:13 he had also seven son and three daughter

42:14 and he call the name of the first jemima; and the name of the
second kezia; and the name of the third kerenhappuch

42:15 and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughter
of job: and their father gave them inherit among their brethren

42:16 after thi live job an hundr and forti year and saw hi
son and hi son son even four gener

42:17 so job die be old and full of day

1:1 bless is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodli
nor standeth in the way of sinner nor sitteth in the seat of the
scorn

1:2 but hi delight is in the law of the lord; and in hi law doth he
medit day and night

1:3 and he shall be like a tree plant by the river of water that
bringeth forth hi fruit in hi season; hi leaf also shall not
wither; and whatsoev he doeth shall prosper

1:4 the ungodli are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away

1:5 therefor the ungodli shall not stand in the judgment nor sinner
in the congreg of the righteou

1:6 for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
ungodli shall perish

sore displeasur

2:6 yet have i set my king upon my holi hill of zion

2:7 i will declar the decree: the lord hath said unto me thou art my

5:4 for thou art not a god that hath pleasur in wickedness: neither

5:5 the foolish shall not stand in thi sight: thou hatest all worker

5:6 thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the lord will abhor

rebel against thee

there is none that doeth good no not one

14:4 have all the worker of iniqu no knowledge? who eat up my

34:21 evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteou
shall be desol

34:22 the lord redeemeth the soul of hi servants: and none of them
that trust in him shall be desol



35:1 plead my caus o lord with them that strive with me: fight
against them that fight against me

35:2 take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help

35:3 draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that
persecut me: say unto my soul i am thi salvat

35:4 let them be confound and put to shame that seek after my soul:
let them be turn back and brought to confus that devis my hurt

35:5 let them be as chaff befor the wind: and let the angel of the
lord chase them

35:6 let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the lord
persecut them

35:7 for without caus have they hid for me their net in a pit which
without caus they have dig for my soul

35:8 let destruct come upon him at unawares; and let hi net that
he hath hid catch himself: into that veri destruct let him fall

35:9 and my soul shall be joy in the lord: it shall rejoic in hi
salvat

35:10 all my bone shall say lord who is like unto thee which
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor
and the needi from him that spoileth him?

35:11 fals wit did rise up; they laid to my charg thing that
i knew not

35:12 they reward me evil for good to the spoil of my soul

35:13 but as for me when they were sick my cloth wa sackcloth: i
humbl my soul with fasting; and my prayer return into mine own
bosom

35:14 i behav myself as though he had been my friend or brother: i
bow down heavili as one that mourneth for hi mother

35:15 but in mine advers they rejoic and gather themselv
together: yea the abject gather themselv togeth against me
and i knew it not; they did tear me and ceas not:

35:16 with hypocrit mocker in feast they gnash upon me with
their teeth

35:17 lord how long wilt thou look on? rescu my soul from their
destruct my darl from the lion

35:18 i will give thee thank in the great congregation: i will prais
thee among much peopl

35:19 let not them that are mine enemi wrong rejoic over me:
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a caus

35:20 for they speak not peace: but they devis deceit matter
against them that are quiet in the land

35:21 yea they open their mouth wide against me and said aha
aha our eye hath seen it

35:22 thi thou hast seen o lord: keep not silence: o lord be not

35:25 let them not say in their heart ah so would we have it: let

35:26 let them be asham and brought to confus togeth that
rejoic at mine hurt: let them be cloth with shame and dishonour
that magnifi themselv against me

35:27 let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteou
cause: yea let them say continu let the lord be magnifi which
hath pleasur in the prosper of hi servant

35:28 and my tongu shall speak of thi righteous and of thi prais
all the day long



36:1 the transgress of the wick saith within my heart that there
is no fear of god befor hi eye

36:2 for he flattereth himself in hi own eye until hi iniqu be
found to be hate

36:3 the word of hi mouth are iniqu and deceit: he hath left off
to be wise and to do good

36:4 he deviseth mischief upon hi bed; he setteth himself in a way
that is not good; he abhorreth not evil

36:5 thi merci o lord is in the heavens; and thi faith
reacheth unto the cloud

36:6 thi righteous is like the great mountains; thi judgment are
a great deep: o lord thou preservest man and beast

36:7 how excel is thi lovingkind o god! therefor the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thi wing

36:8 they shall be abundantli satisfi with the fat of thi house;
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thi pleasur

36:9 for with thee is the fountain of life: in thi light shall we see
light

36:10 o continu thi lovingkind unto them that know thee; and thi
righteous to the upright in heart

36:11 let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand
of the wick remov me

36:12 there are the worker of iniqu fallen: they are cast down
and shall not be abl to rise



37:1 fret not thyself becaus of evildo neither be thou enviou
against the worker of iniqu

37:2 for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the
green herb

37:3 trust in the lord and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land
and verili thou shalt be fed

37:4 delight thyself also in the lord: and he shall give thee the
desir of thine heart

37:5 commit thi way unto the lord; trust also in him; and he shall
bring it to pass

37:6 and he shall bring forth thi righteous as the light and thi
judgment as the noonday

37:7 rest in the lord and wait patient for him: fret not thyself
becaus of him who prospereth in hi way becaus of the man who
bringeth wick devic to pass

37:8 ceas from anger and forsak wrath: fret not thyself in ani wise
to do evil

37:9 for evildo shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
lord they shall inherit the earth

37:10 for yet a littl while and the wick shall not be: yea thou
shalt dilig consid hi place and it shall not be

37:11 but the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
themselv in the abund of peac

37:12 the wick plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with
hi teeth

37:13 the lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that hi day is
come

37:14 the wick have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to
cast down the poor and needi and to slay such as be of upright
convers

37:15 their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bow
shall be broken

37:16 a littl that a righteou man hath is better than the rich of
mani wick

37:17 for the arm of the wick shall be broken: but the lord
upholdeth the righteou

37:18 the lord knoweth the day of the upright: and their inherit
shall be for ever

37:19 they shall not be asham in the evil time: and in the day of
famin they shall be satisfi

37:20 but the wick shall perish and the enemi of the lord shall
be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they
consum away

37:21 the wick borroweth and payeth not again: but the righteou
sheweth merci and giveth

37:22 for such as be bless of him shall inherit the earth; and they
that be curs of him shall be cut off

37:23 the step of a good man are order by the lord: and he
delighteth in hi way

37:24 though he fall he shall not be utterli cast down: for the lord
upholdeth him with hi hand

37:25 i have been young and now am old; yet have i not seen the
righteou forsaken nor hi seed beg bread

37:26 he is ever merci and lendeth; and hi seed is bless

37:27 depart from evil and do good; and dwell for evermor

37:28 for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not hi saints; they
are preserv for ever: but the seed of the wick shall be cut off

37:29 the righteou shall inherit the land and dwell therein for
ever

37:30 the mouth of the righteou speaketh wisdom and hi tongu
talketh of judgment

37:31 the law of hi god is in hi heart; none of hi step shall
slide

37:32 the wick watcheth the righteou and seeketh to slay him

37:33 the lord will not leav him in hi hand nor condemn him when he
is judg

37:34 wait on the lord and keep hi way and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wick are cut off thou shalt see it

37:35 i have seen the wick in great power and spread himself
like a green bay tree

37:36 yet he pass away and lo he wa not: yea i sought him but
he could not be found

37:37 mark the perfect man and behold the upright: for the end of
that man is peac

37:38 but the transgressor shall be destroy together: the end of
the wick shall be cut off

37:39 but the salvat of the righteou is of the lord: he is their
strength in the time of troubl

37:40 and the lord shall help them and deliv them: he shall deliv
them from the wick and save them becaus they trust in him

38:12 they also that seek after my life lay snare for me: and they
that seek my hurt speak mischiev thing and imagin deceit all

38:14 thu i wa as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no
reproof

38:15 for in thee o lord do i hope: thou wilt hear o lord my god

38:16 for i said hear me lest otherwis they should rejoic over me:
when my foot slippeth they magnifi themselv against me

38:17 for i am readi to halt and my sorrow is continu befor me

38:18 for i will declar mine iniquity; i will be sorri for my sin

38:19 but mine enemi are live and they are strong: and they that

50:13 will i eat the flesh of bull or drink the blood of goats?

50:14 offer unto god thanksgiving; and pay thi vow unto the most

50:16 but unto the wick god saith what hast thou to do to declar

50:19 thou givest thi mouth to evil and thi tongu frameth deceit

50:20 thou sittest and speakest against thi brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother son

50:21 these thing hast thou done and i kept silence; thou thoughtest
that i wa altogeth such an one as thyself: but i will reprov thee

clear when thou judgest

51:5 behold i wa shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother

51:6 behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom

51:7 purg me with hyssop and i shall be clean: wash me and i shall

contrit heart o god thou wilt not despis

51:18 do good in thi good pleasur unto zion: build thou the wall of
jerusalem

51:19 then shalt thou be pleas with the sacrific of righteous

bullock upon thine altar



52:1 whi boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighti man? the good

52:5 god shall likewis destroy thee for ever he shall take thee
away and pluck thee out of thi dwell place and root thee out of

52:6 the righteou also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him:

52:7 lo thi is the man that made not god hi strength; but trust
in the abund of hi rich and strengthen himself in hi
wicked

52:8 but i am like a green oliv tree in the hous of god: i trust in
the merci of god for ever and ever

53:3 everi one of them is gone back: they are altogeth becom
filthy; there is none that doeth good no not one

53:4 have the worker of iniqu no knowledge? who eat up my peopl
as they eat bread: they have not call upon god

55:2 attend unto me and hear me: i mourn in my complaint and make a

55:4 my heart is sore pain within me: and the terror of death are
fallen upon me

55:5 fear and trembl are come upon me and horror hath
overwhelm me

55:6 and i said oh that i had wing like a dove! for then would i fli

55:9 destroy o lord and divid their tongues: for i have seen
violenc and strife in the citi

55:10 day and night they go about it upon the wall thereof: mischief

55:11 wicked is in the midst thereof: deceit and guil depart not
from her street

55:12 for it wa not an enemi that reproach me; then i could have
born it: neither wa it he that hate me that did magnifi himself
against me; then i would have hid myself from him:

55:13 but it wa thou a man mine equal my guid and mine
acquaint

55:14 we took sweet counsel togeth and walk unto the hous of god
in compani

55:15 let death seiz upon them and let them go down quick into hell:
for wicked is in their dwell and among them

55:16 as for me i will call upon god; and the lord shall save me

55:17 even and morn and at noon will i pray and cri aloud:
and he shall hear my voic

55:22 cast thi burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee: he
shall never suffer the righteou to be move

55:23 but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction: bloodi and deceit men shall not live out half their

69:1 save me o god; for the water are come in unto my soul

69:2 i sink in deep mire where there is no standing: i am come into
deep water where the flood overflow me

69:3 i am weari of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eye fail while
i wait for my god

69:4 they that hate me without a caus are more than the hair of mine
head: they that would destroy me be mine enemi wrong are
mighty: then i restor that which i took not away

69:5 o god thou knowest my foolishness; and my sin are not hid from
thee

69:6 let not them that wait on thee o lord god of host be asham
for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confound for my sake o
god of israel

69:7 becaus for thi sake i have born reproach; shame hath cover my
face

69:8 i am becom a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my
mother children

69:9 for the zeal of thine hous hath eaten me up; and the reproach
of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me

69:10 when i wept and chasten my soul with fast that wa to my
reproach

69:11 i made sackcloth also my garment; and i becam a proverb to
them

69:12 they that sit in the gate speak against me; and i wa the song
of the drunkard

69:13 but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an accept
time: o god in the multitud of thi merci hear me in the truth of
thi salvat

69:14 deliv me out of the mire and let me not sink: let me be
deliv from them that hate me and out of the deep water

69:15 let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow
me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me

69:16 hear me o lord; for thi lovingkind is good: turn unto me
accord to the multitud of thi tender merci

69:19 thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour:
mine adversari are all befor thee

69:20 reproach hath broken my heart; and i am full of heaviness: and i
look for some to take piti but there wa none; and for comfort
but i found none

69:21 they gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink

69:22 let their tabl becom a snare befor them: and that which
should have been for their welfar let it becom a trap

69:23 let their eye be darken that they see not; and make their
loin continu to shake

69:24 pour out thine indign upon them and let thi wrath anger
take hold of them

69:25 let their habit be desolate; and let none dwell in their
tent

69:26 for they persecut him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wound

69:27 add iniqu unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thi
righteous

69:28 let them be blot out of the book of the live and not be
written with the righteou

69:29 but i am poor and sorrowful: let thi salvat o god set me up
on high

69:30 i will prais the name of god with a song and will magnifi him
with thanksgiv

that hath horn and hoof

69:32 the humbl shall see thi and be glad: and your heart shall
live that seek god

69:33 for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not hi prison

69:34 let the heaven and earth prais him the sea and everi thing
that moveth therein

69:35 for god will save zion and will build the citi of judah: that
they may dwell there and have it in possess

69:36 the seed also of hi servant shall inherit it: and they that
love hi name shall dwell therein

71:10 for mine enemi speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel togeth

71:11 say god hath forsaken him: persecut and take him; for there
is none to deliv him

71:12 o god be not far from me: o my god make hast for my help

73:1 truli god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean
heart

73:2 but as for me my feet were almost gone; my step had well nigh
slip

73:3 for i wa enviou at the foolish when i saw the prosper of
the wick

73:4 for there are no band in their death: but their strength is
firm

73:5 they are not in troubl as other men; neither are they plagu
like other men

73:6 therefor pride compasseth them about as a chain; violenc
covereth them as a garment

73:7 their eye stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
could wish

73:8 they are corrupt and speak wickedli concern oppression: they
speak loftili

73:9 they set their mouth against the heaven and their tongu
walketh through the earth

73:10 therefor hi peopl return hither: and water of a full cup are
wrung out to them

73:11 and they say how doth god know? and is there knowledg in the
most high?

73:12 behold these are the ungodli who prosper in the world; they
increas in rich

73:13 verili i have cleans my heart in vain and wash my hand in
innoc

73:14 for all the day long have i been plagu and chasten everi
morn

73:15 if i say i will speak thus; behold i should offend against the

73:16 when i thought to know thi it wa too pain for me;

73:17 until i went into the sanctuari of god; then understood i their
end

73:18 sure thou didst set them in slipperi places: thou castedst
them down into destruct

73:19 how are they brought into desol as in a moment! they are
utterli consum with terror

73:20 as a dream when one awaketh; so o lord when thou awakest thou
shalt despis their imag

73:21 thu my heart wa griev and i wa prick in my rein

73:24 thou shalt guid me with thi counsel and afterward receiv me
to glori

73:25 whom have i in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
that i desir besid thee

73:26 my flesh and my heart faileth: but god is the strength of my
heart and my portion for ever

73:27 for lo they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
destroy all them that go a whore from thee

73:28 but it is good for me to draw near to god: i have put my trust
in the lord god that i may declar all thi work

74:7 they have cast fire into thi sanctuari they have defil by

74:9 we see not our signs: there is no more ani prophet: neither is
there among us ani that knoweth how long

74:10 o god how long shall the adversari reproach? shall the enemi
blasphem thi name for ever?

head of the dragon in the water

74:14 thou brakest the head of leviathan in piec and gavest him to

74:15 thou didst cleav the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
mighti river

74:16 the day is thine the night also is thine: thou hast prepar
the light and the sun

74:17 thou hast set all the border of the earth: thou hast made
summer and winter

lift not up the horn:

75:5 lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck

75:6 for promot cometh neither from the east nor from the west
nor from the south

75:7 but god is the judge: he putteth down one and setteth up
anoth

75:8 for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red;
it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dreg
thereof all the wick of the earth shall wring them out and drink
them

75:9 but i will declar for ever; i will sing prais to the god of

77:3 i rememb god and wa troubled: i complain and my spirit

77:4 thou holdest mine eye waking: i am so troubl that i cannot

77:17 the cloud pour out water: the sky sent out a sound: thine
arrow also went abroad

77:18 the voic of thi thunder wa in the heaven: the lightn
lighten the world: the earth trembl and shook

77:19 thi way is in the sea and thi path in the great water and thi
footstep are not known

77:20 thou leddest thi peopl like a flock by the hand of mose and
aaron



78:1 give ear o my peopl to my law: inclin your ear to the word
of my mouth

78:2 i will open my mouth in a parable: i will utter dark say of
old:

78:3 which we have heard and known and our father have told us

78:4 we will not hide them from their children shew to the
gener to come the prais of the lord and hi strength and hi
wonder work that he hath done

78:5 for he establish a testimoni in jacob and appoint a law in
israel which he command our father that they should make them
known to their children:

78:6 that the gener to come might know them even the children
which should be born; who should aris and declar them to their
children:

78:7 that they might set their hope in god and not forget the work
of god but keep hi commandments:

78:8 and might not be as their father a stubborn and rebelli
generation; a gener that set not their heart aright and whose
spirit wa not stedfast with god

78:9 the children of ephraim be arm and carri bow turn
back in the day of battl

78:10 they kept not the coven of god and refus to walk in hi
law;

78:11 and forgat hi work and hi wonder that he had shew them

78:12 marvel thing did he in the sight of their father in the
land of egypt in the field of zoan

78:13 he divid the sea and caus them to pass through; and he made
the water to stand as an heap

78:14 in the daytim also he led them with a cloud and all the night
with a light of fire

78:15 he clave the rock in the wilder and gave them drink as out
of the great depth

78:16 he brought stream also out of the rock and caus water to
run down like river

78:17 and they sin yet more against him by provok the most high
in the wilder

78:18 and they tempt god in their heart by ask meat for their
lust

78:19 yea they spake against god; they said can god furnish a tabl
in the wilderness?

78:20 behold he smote the rock that the water gush out and the
stream overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provid flesh for
hi people?

78:21 therefor the lord heard thi and wa wroth: so a fire wa
kindl against jacob and anger also came up against israel;

78:22 becaus they believ not in god and trust not in hi
salvation:

78:23 though he had command the cloud from abov and open the
door of heaven

78:24 and had rain down manna upon them to eat and had given them
of the corn of heaven

78:25 man did eat angel food: he sent them meat to the full

78:26 he caus an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by hi power
he brought in the south wind

78:27 he rain flesh also upon them as dust and feather fowl like
as the sand of the sea:

78:28 and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their
habit

78:29 so they did eat and were well filled: for he gave them their
own desire;

78:30 they were not estrang from their lust but while their meat
wa yet in their mouth

78:31 the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them
and smote down the chosen men of israel

78:32 for all thi they sin still and believ not for hi
wondrou work

78:33 therefor their day did he consum in vaniti and their year
in troubl

78:34 when he slew them then they sought him: and they return and
enquir earli after god

78:35 and they rememb that god wa their rock and the high god
their redeem

78:36 nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they
lie unto him with their tongu

78:37 for their heart wa not right with him neither were they
stedfast in hi coven

78:38 but he be full of compass forgav their iniqu and
destroy them not: yea mani a time turn he hi anger away and did
not stir up all hi wrath

78:39 for he rememb that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
away and cometh not again

78:40 how oft did they provok him in the wilder and griev him
in the desert!

78:41 yea they turn back and tempt god and limit the holi one
of israel

78:42 they rememb not hi hand nor the day when he deliv them
from the enemi

78:43 how he had wrought hi sign in egypt and hi wonder in the
field of zoan

78:44 and had turn their river into blood; and their flood that
they could not drink

78:45 he sent diver sort of fli among them which devour them;
and frog which destroy them

78:46 he gave also their increas unto the caterpil and their
labour unto the locust

78:47 he destroy their vine with hail and their sycomor tree
with frost

78:48 he gave up their cattl also to the hail and their flock to
hot thunderbolt

78:49 he cast upon them the fierc of hi anger wrath and
indign and troubl by send evil angel among them

78:50 he made a way to hi anger; he spare not their soul from death
but gave their life over to the pestilence;

78:51 and smote all the firstborn in egypt; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacl of ham:

78:52 but made hi own peopl to go forth like sheep and guid them
in the wilder like a flock

78:53 and he led them on safe so that they fear not: but the sea
overwhelm their enemi

78:54 and he brought them to the border of hi sanctuari even to thi
mountain which hi right hand had purchas

78:55 he cast out the heathen also befor them and divid them an
inherit by line and made the tribe of israel to dwell in their
tent

78:56 yet they tempt and provok the most high god and kept not
hi testimonies:

78:57 but turn back and dealt unfaith like their fathers: they
were turn asid like a deceit bow

78:58 for they provok him to anger with their high place and move
him to jealousi with their graven imag

78:59 when god heard thi he wa wroth and greatli abhor israel:

78:60 so that he forsook the tabernacl of shiloh the tent which he
place among men;

78:61 and deliv hi strength into captiv and hi glori into
the enemi hand

78:62 he gave hi peopl over also unto the sword; and wa wroth with
hi inherit

78:63 the fire consum their young men; and their maiden were not
given to marriag

78:64 their priest fell by the sword; and their widow made no
lament

78:65 then the lord awak as one out of sleep and like a mighti man
that shouteth by reason of wine

78:66 and he smote hi enemi in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetu reproach

78:67 moreov he refus the tabernacl of joseph and chose not the
tribe of ephraim:

78:68 but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he love

78:69 and he built hi sanctuari like high palac like the earth
which he hath establish for ever

78:70 he chose david also hi servant and took him from the
sheepfolds:

78:71 from follow the ewe great with young he brought him to feed
jacob hi peopl and israel hi inherit

78:72 so he fed them accord to the integr of hi heart; and
guid them by the skil of hi hand



79:1 o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thi holi
templ have they defiled; they have laid jerusalem on heap

79:2 the dead bodi of thi servant have they given to be meat unto
the fowl of the heaven the flesh of thi saint unto the beast of
the earth

79:3 their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem; and
there wa none to buri them

79:4 we are becom a reproach to our neighbour a scorn and deris
to them that are round about us

79:5 how long lord? wilt thou be angri for ever? shall thi jealousi
burn like fire?

79:6 pour out thi wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and
upon the kingdom that have not call upon thi name

79:7 for they have devour jacob and laid wast hi dwell place

known among the heathen in our sight by the reveng of the blood of
thi servant which is shed

79:11 let the sigh of the prison come befor thee; accord to
the great of thi power preserv thou those that are appoint to
die;

79:12 and render unto our neighbour sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach wherewith they have reproach thee o lord

79:13 so we thi peopl and sheep of thi pastur will give thee thank
for ever: we will shew forth thi prais to all gener

and come and save us

80:3 turn us again o god and caus thi face to shine; and we shall

80:4 o lord god of host how long wilt thou be angri against the
prayer of thi people?

80:5 thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tear

80:6 thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemi
laugh among themselv

80:7 turn us again o god of host and caus thi face to shine; and

106:6 we have sin with our father we have commit iniqu we
have done wickedli

106:7 our father understood not thi wonder in egypt; they rememb
not the multitud of thi mercies; but provok him at the sea even at
the red sea

106:8 nevertheless he save them for hi name sake that he might
make hi mighti power to be known

106:9 he rebuk the red sea also and it wa dri up: so he led them
through the depth as through the wilder

106:10 and he save them from the hand of him that hate them and
redeem them from the hand of the enemi

106:11 and the water cover their enemies: there wa not one of them
left

106:12 then believ they hi words; they sang hi prais

106:13 they soon forgat hi works; they wait not for hi counsel:

106:14 but lust exceedingli in the wilder and tempt god in
the desert

106:15 and he gave them their request; but sent lean into their

106:16 they envi mose also in the camp and aaron the saint of the
lord

106:17 the earth open and swallow up dathan and cover the
compani of abiram

106:18 and a fire wa kindl in their company; the flame burn up
the wick

106:19 they made a calf in horeb and worship the molten imag

106:20 thu they chang their glori into the similitud of an ox that
eateth grass

106:21 they forgat god their saviour which had done great thing in
egypt;

106:22 wondrou work in the land of ham and terribl thing by the

should destroy them

106:24 yea they despis the pleasant land they believ not hi

106:25 but murmur in their tent and hearken not unto the voic
of the lord

106:26 therefor he lift up hi hand against them to overthrow them
in the wilderness:

106:27 to overthrow their seed also among the nation and to scatter

106:28 they join themselv also unto baalpeor and ate the
sacrific of the dead

106:29 thu they provok him to anger with their inventions: and the
plagu brake in upon them

106:30 then stood up phineha and execut judgment: and so the
plagu wa stay

106:31 and that wa count unto him for righteous unto all
gener for evermor

106:32 they anger him also at the water of strife so that it went
ill with mose for their sakes:

106:33 becaus they provok hi spirit so that he spake unadvisedli
with hi lip

106:34 they did not destroy the nation concern whom the lord
command them:

106:35 but were mingl among the heathen and learn their work

106:36 and they serv their idols: which were a snare unto them

106:37 yea they sacrif their son and their daughter unto
devil

106:38 and shed innoc blood even the blood of their son and of
their daughter whom they sacrif unto the idol of canaan: and
the land wa pollut with blood

106:39 thu were they defil with their own work and went a whore
with their own invent

106:40 therefor wa the wrath of the lord kindl against hi peopl
insomuch that he abhor hi own inherit

106:41 and he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hate them rule over them

106:42 their enemi also oppress them and they were brought into

106:43 mani time did he deliv them; but they provok him with
their counsel and were brought low for their iniqu

106:44 nevertheless he regard their afflict when he heard their

106:46 he made them also to be piti of all those that carri them

107:4 they wander in the wilder in a solitari way; they found no

107:5 hungri and thirsti their soul faint in them

107:6 then they cri unto the lord in their troubl and he deliv

107:11 becaus they rebel against the word of god and contemn

107:13 then they cri unto the lord in their troubl and he save

107:14 he brought them out of dark and the shadow of death and

107:21 oh that men would prais the lord for hi good and for hi

great waters;

107:24 these see the work of the lord and hi wonder in the deep

107:25 for he commandeth and raiseth the stormi wind which lifteth

107:26 they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths:
their soul is melt becaus of troubl

107:27 they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are

107:28 then they cri unto the lord in their troubl and he bringeth

107:35 he turneth the wilder into a stand water and dri ground
into waterspr

107:36 and there he maketh the hungri to dwell that they may prepar
a citi for habitation;

107:37 and sow the field and plant vineyard which may yield fruit

the proverb


1:1 the proverb of solomon the son of david king of israel; 1:2 to
know wisdom and instruction; to perceiv the word of understanding;
1:3 to receiv the instruct of wisdom justic and judgment and
equity; 1:4 to give subtilti to the simpl to the young man knowledg
and discret

1:5 a wise man will hear and will increas learning; and a man of
understand shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 to understand a
proverb and the interpretation; the word of the wise and their dark
say

1:7 the fear of the lord is the begin of knowledge: but fool
despis wisdom and instruct

1:8 my son hear the instruct of thi father and forsak not the
law of thi mother: 1:9 for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thi
head and chain about thi neck

1:10 my son if sinner entic thee consent thou not

1:11 if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk
privili for the innoc without cause: 1:12 let us swallow them up
aliv as the grave; and whole as those that go down into the pit:
1:13 we shall find all preciou substanc we shall fill our hous
with spoil: 1:14 cast in thi lot among us; let us all have one purse:
1:15 my son walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thi foot from
their path: 1:16 for their feet run to evil and make hast to shed
blood

1:17 sure in vain the net is spread in the sight of ani bird

1:18 and they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privili for
their own live

1:19 so are the way of everi one that is greedi of gain; which taketh
away the life of the owner thereof

1:20 wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voic in the streets:
1:21 she crieth in the chief place of concours in the open of
the gates: in the citi she uttereth her word say 1:22 how long
ye simpl one will ye love simplicity? and the scorner delight in
their scorn and fool hate knowledge? 1:23 turn you at my
reproof: behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known
my word unto you

1:24 becaus i have call and ye refused; i have stretch out my
hand and no man regarded; 1:25 but ye have set at nought all my
counsel and would none of my reproof: 1:26 i also will laugh at your
calamity; i will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 when your fear
cometh as desol and your destruct cometh as a whirlwind; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you

1:28 then shall they call upon me but i will not answer; they shall
seek me earli but they shall not find me: 1:29 for that they hate
knowledg and did not choos the fear of the lord: 1:30 they would
none of my counsel: they despis all my reproof

1:31 therefor shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be
fill with their own devic

1:32 for the turn away of the simpl shall slay them and the
prosper of fool shall destroy them

1:33 but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safe and shall be
quiet from fear of evil

2:1 my son if thou wilt receiv my word and hide my command
with thee; 2:2 so that thou inclin thine ear unto wisdom and appli
thine heart to understanding; 2:3 yea if thou criest after knowledg
and liftest up thi voic for understanding; 2:4 if thou seekest her as
silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 then shalt
thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledg of god

2:6 for the lord giveth wisdom: out of hi mouth cometh knowledg and
understand

2:7 he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightli

2:8 he keepeth the path of judgment and preserveth the way of hi
saint

2:9 then shalt thou understand righteous and judgment and
equity; yea everi good path

2:10 when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledg is pleasant
unto thi soul; 2:11 discret shall preserv thee understand
shall keep thee: 2:12 to deliv thee from the way of the evil man
from the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 who leav the path of
upright to walk in the way of darkness; 2:14 who rejoic to do
evil and delight in the froward of the wicked; 2:15 whose way
are crook and they froward in their paths: 2:16 to deliv thee
from the strang woman even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words; 2:17 which forsaketh the guid of her youth and forgetteth
the coven of her god

2:18 for her hous inclineth unto death and her path unto the dead

2:19 none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the
path of life

2:20 that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the path
of the righteou

2:21 for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall
remain in it

2:22 but the wick shall be cut off from the earth and the
transgressor shall be root out of it

3:1 my son forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
commandments: 3:2 for length of day and long life and peac shall
they add to thee

3:3 let not merci and truth forsak thee: bind them about thi neck;
write them upon the tabl of thine heart: 3:4 so shalt thou find
favour and good understand in the sight of god and man

3:5 trust in the lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
own understand

3:6 in all thi way acknowledg him and he shall direct thi path

3:7 be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the lord and depart from
evil

3:8 it shall be health to thi navel and marrow to thi bone

3:9 honour the lord with thi substanc and with the firstfruit of
all thine increase: 3:10 so shall thi barn be fill with plenti and
thi press shall burst out with new wine

3:11 my son despis not the chasten of the lord; neither be weari
of hi correction: 3:12 for whom the lord loveth he correcteth; even
as a father the son in whom he delighteth

3:13 happi is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth
understand

3:14 for the merchandis of it is better than the merchandis of
silver and the gain thereof than fine gold

3:15 she is more preciou than rubies: and all the thing thou canst
desir are not to be compar unto her

3:16 length of day is in her right hand; and in her left hand rich
and honour

3:17 her way are way of pleasant and all her path are peac

3:18 she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happi
is everi one that retaineth her

3:19 the lord by wisdom hath found the earth; by understand hath
he establish the heaven

3:20 by hi knowledg the depth are broken up and the cloud drop
down the dew

3:21 my son let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
and discretion: 3:22 so shall they be life unto thi soul and grace to
thi neck

3:23 then shalt thou walk in thi way safe and thi foot shall not
stumbl

3:24 when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid: yea thou shalt
lie down and thi sleep shall be sweet

3:25 be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desol of the
wick when it cometh

3:26 for the lord shall be thi confid and shall keep thi foot
from be taken

3:27 withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the
power of thine hand to do it

3:28 say not unto thi neighbour go and come again and to morrow i
will give; when thou hast it by thee

3:29 devis not evil against thi neighbour see he dwelleth
secur by thee

3:30 strive not with a man without caus if he have done thee no
harm

3:31 envi thou not the oppressor and choos none of hi way

3:32 for the froward is abomin to the lord: but hi secret is
with the righteou

3:33 the curs of the lord is in the hous of the wicked: but he
blesseth the habit of the just

3:34 sure he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
lowli

3:35 the wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promot of
fool

4:1 hear ye children the instruct of a father and attend to know
understand

4:2 for i give you good doctrin forsak ye not my law

4:3 for i wa my father son tender and onli belov in the sight of
my mother

4:4 he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my
words: keep my command and live

4:5 get wisdom get understanding: forget it not; neither declin from
the word of my mouth

4:6 forsak her not and she shall preserv thee: love her and she
shall keep thee

4:7 wisdom is the princip thing; therefor get wisdom: and with all
thi get get understand

4:8 exalt her and she shall promot thee: she shall bring thee to
honour when thou dost embrac her

4:9 she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
glori shall she deliv to thee

4:10 hear o my son and receiv my sayings; and the year of thi life
shall be mani

4:11 i have taught thee in the way of wisdom; i have led thee in right
path

4:12 when thou goest thi step shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest thou shalt not stumbl

4:13 take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she
is thi life

4:14 enter not into the path of the wick and go not in the way of
evil men

4:15 avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away

4:16 for they sleep not except they have done mischief; and their
sleep is taken away unless they caus some to fall

4:17 for they eat the bread of wicked and drink the wine of
violenc

4:18 but the path of the just is as the shine light that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day

4:19 the way of the wick is as darkness: they know not at what they
stumbl

4:20 my son attend to my words; inclin thine ear unto my say

4:21 let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
thine heart

4:22 for they are life unto those that find them and health to all
their flesh

4:23 keep thi heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issu
of life

4:24 put away from thee a froward mouth and pervers lip put far
from thee

4:25 let thine eye look right on and let thine eyelid look straight
befor thee

4:26 ponder the path of thi feet and let all thi way be establish

4:27 turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remov thi foot from
evil

5:1 my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my
understanding: 5:2 that thou mayest regard discret and that thi
lip may keep knowledg

5:3 for the lip of a strang woman drop as an honeycomb and her
mouth is smoother than oil: 5:4 but her end is bitter as wormwood
sharp as a two-edg sword

5:5 her feet go down to death; her step take hold on hell

5:6 lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her way are
moveabl that thou canst not know them

5:7 hear me now therefor o ye children and depart not from the
word of my mouth

5:8 remov thi way far from her and come not nigh the door of her
house: 5:9 lest thou give thine honour unto other and thi year unto
the cruel: 5:10 lest stranger be fill with thi wealth; and thi
labour be in the hous of a stranger; 5:11 and thou mourn at the
last when thi flesh and thi bodi are consum 5:12 and say how have
i hate instruct and my heart despis reproof; 5:13 and have not
obey the voic of my teacher nor inclin mine ear to them that
instruct me! 5:14 i wa almost in all evil in the midst of the
congreg and assembl

5:15 drink water out of thine own cistern and run water out of
thine own well

5:16 let thi fountain be dispers abroad and river of water in
the street

5:17 let them be onli thine own and not stranger with thee

5:18 let thi fountain be blessed: and rejoic with the wife of thi
youth

5:19 let her be as the love hind and pleasant roe; let her breast
satisfi thee at all times; and be thou ravish alway with her love

5:20 and whi wilt thou my son be ravish with a strang woman and
embrac the bosom of a stranger? 5:21 for the way of man are befor
the eye of the lord and he pondereth all hi go

5:22 hi own iniqu shall take the wick himself and he shall be
holden with the cord of hi sin

5:23 he shall die without instruction; and in the great of hi
folli he shall go astray

6:1 my son if thou be sureti for thi friend if thou hast stricken
thi hand with a stranger 6:2 thou art snare with the word of thi
mouth thou art taken with the word of thi mouth

6:3 do thi now my son and deliv thyself when thou art come into
the hand of thi friend; go humbl thyself and make sure thi friend

6:4 give not sleep to thine eye nor slumber to thine eyelid

6:5 deliv thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler

6:6 go to the ant thou sluggard; consid her way and be wise: 6:7
which have no guid overs or ruler 6:8 provideth her meat in
the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest

6:9 how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard? when wilt thou aris out of
thi sleep? 6:10 yet a littl sleep a littl slumber a littl
fold of the hand to sleep: 6:11 so shall thi poverti come as one
that travelleth and thi want as an arm man

6:12 a naughti person a wick man walketh with a froward mouth

6:13 he winketh with hi eye he speaketh with hi feet he teacheth
with hi fingers; 6:14 froward is in hi heart he deviseth
mischief continually; he soweth discord

6:15 therefor shall hi calam come suddenly; suddenli shall he be
broken without remedi

6:16 these six thing doth the lord hate: yea seven are an
abomin unto him: 6:17 a proud look a lie tongu and hand
that shed innoc blood 6:18 an heart that deviseth wick
imagin feet that be swift in run to mischief 6:19 a fals
wit that speaketh lie and he that soweth discord among brethren

6:20 my son keep thi father command and forsak not the law of
thi mother: 6:21 bind them continu upon thine heart and tie them
about thi neck

6:22 when thou goest it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest it shall
keep thee; and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee

6:23 for the command is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproof
of instruct are the way of life: 6:24 to keep thee from the evil
woman from the flatteri of the tongu of a strang woman

6:25 lust not after her beauti in thine heart; neither let her take
thee with her eyelid

6:26 for by mean of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piec of
bread: and the adultress will hunt for the preciou life

6:27 can a man take fire in hi bosom and hi cloth not be burned?
6:28 can one go upon hot coal and hi feet not be burned? 6:29 so
he that goeth in to hi neighbour wife; whosoev toucheth her shall
not be innoc

6:30 men do not despis a thief if he steal to satisfi hi soul when
he is hungry; 6:31 but if he be found he shall restor sevenfold; he
shall give all the substanc of hi hous

6:32 but whoso committeth adulteri with a woman lacketh understanding:
he that doeth it destroyeth hi own soul

6:33 a wound and dishonour shall he get; and hi reproach shall not be
wipe away

6:34 for jealousi is the rage of a man: therefor he will not spare in
the day of vengeanc

6:35 he will not regard ani ransom; neither will he rest content
though thou givest mani gift

7:1 my son keep my word and lay up my command with thee

7:2 keep my command and live; and my law as the appl of thine
eye

7:3 bind them upon thi finger write them upon the tabl of thine
heart

7:4 say unto wisdom thou art my sister; and call understand thi
kinswoman: 7:5 that they may keep thee from the strang woman from
the stranger which flattereth with her word

7:6 for at the window of my hous i look through my casement 7:7
and beheld among the simpl one i discern among the youth a
young man void of understand 7:8 pass through the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her hous 7:9 in the twilight in
the even in the black and dark night: 7:10 and behold there met
him a woman with the attir of an harlot and subtil of heart

7:11 (she is loud and stubborn; her feet abid not in her house: 7:12
now is she without now in the street and lieth in wait at everi
corner) 7:13 so she caught him and kiss him and with an impud
face said unto him 7:14 i have peac offer with me; thi day have
i pay my vow

7:15 therefor came i forth to meet thee dilig to seek thi face
and i have found thee

7:16 i have deck my bed with cover of tapestri with carv
work with fine linen of egypt

7:17 i have perfum my bed with myrrh alo and cinnamon

7:18 come let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
solac ourselv with love

7:19 for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey: 7:20
he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day
appoint

7:21 with her much fair speech she caus him to yield with the
flatter of her lip she forc him

7:22 he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter
or as a fool to the correct of the stocks; 7:23 till a dart strike
through hi liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not
that it is for hi life

7:24 hearken unto me now therefor o ye children and attend to the
word of my mouth

7:25 let not thine heart declin to her way go not astray in her
path

7:26 for she hath cast down mani wounded: yea mani strong men have
been slain by her

7:27 her hous is the way to hell go down to the chamber of
death

8:1 doth not wisdom cry? and understand put forth her voice? 8:2
she standeth in the top of high place by the way in the place of
the path

8:3 she crieth at the gate at the entri of the citi at the come
in at the door

8:4 unto you o men i call; and my voic is to the son of man

8:5 o ye simpl understand wisdom: and ye fool be ye of an
understand heart

8:6 hear; for i will speak of excel things; and the open of my
lip shall be right thing

8:7 for my mouth shall speak truth; and wicked is an abomin
to my lip

8:8 all the word of my mouth are in righteousness; there is noth
froward or pervers in them

8:9 they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them
that find knowledg

8:10 receiv my instruct and not silver; and knowledg rather than
choic gold

8:11 for wisdom is better than rubies; and all the thing that may be
desir are not to be compar to it

8:12 i wisdom dwell with prudenc and find out knowledg of witti
invent

8:13 the fear of the lord is to hate evil: pride and arrog and
the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate

8:14 counsel is mine and sound wisdom: i am understanding; i have
strength

8:15 by me king reign and princ decre justic

8:16 by me princ rule and nobl even all the judg of the earth

8:17 i love them that love me; and those that seek me earli shall find
me

8:18 rich and honour are with me; yea durabl rich and
righteous

8:19 my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold; and my revenu
than choic silver

8:20 i lead in the way of righteous in the midst of the path of
judgment: 8:21 that i may caus those that love me to inherit
substance; and i will fill their treasur

8:22 the lord possess me in the begin of hi way befor hi
work of old

8:23 i wa set up from everlast from the begin or ever the
earth wa

8:24 when there were no depth i wa brought forth; when there were
no fountain abound with water

8:25 befor the mountain were settl befor the hill wa i brought
forth: 8:26 while as yet he had not made the earth nor the field
nor the highest part of the dust of the world

8:27 when he prepar the heaven i wa there: when he set a compass
upon the face of the depth: 8:28 when he establish the cloud above:
when he strengthen the fountain of the deep: 8:29 when he gave to
the sea hi decre that the water should not pass hi commandment:
when he appoint the foundat of the earth: 8:30 then i wa by
him as one brought up with him: and i wa daili hi delight
rejoic alway befor him; 8:31 rejoic in the habit part of
hi earth; and my delight were with the son of men

8:32 now therefor hearken unto me o ye children: for bless are
they that keep my way

8:33 hear instruct and be wise and refus it not

8:34 bless is the man that heareth me watch daili at my gate
wait at the post of my door

8:35 for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the
lord

8:36 but he that sinneth against me wrongeth hi own soul: all they
that hate me love death

9:1 wisdom hath build her hous she hath hewn out her seven
pillars: 9:2 she hath kill her beasts; she hath mingl her wine;
she hath also furnish her tabl

9:3 she hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
place of the citi 9:4 whoso is simpl let him turn in hither: as
for him that wanteth understand she saith to him 9:5 come eat of
my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingl

9:6 forsak the foolish and live; and go in the way of understand

9:7 he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that
rebuketh a wick man getteth himself a blot

9:8 reprov not a scorner lest he hate thee: rebuk a wise man and
he will love thee

9:9 give instruct to a wise man and he will be yet wiser: teach a
just man and he will increas in learn

9:10 the fear of the lord is the begin of wisdom: and the
knowledg of the holi is understand

9:11 for by me thi day shall be multipli and the year of thi life
shall be increas

9:12 if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
scornest thou alon shalt bear it

9:13 a foolish woman is clamorous: she is simpl and knoweth noth

9:14 for she sitteth at the door of her hous on a seat in the high
place of the citi 9:15 to call passeng who go right on their
ways: 9:16 whoso is simpl let him turn in hither: and as for him
that wanteth understand she saith to him 9:17 stolen water are
sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant

9:18 but he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guest
are in the depth of hell

10:1 the proverb of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father: but a
foolish son is the heavi of hi mother

10:2 treasur of wicked profit nothing: but righteous
delivereth from death

10:3 the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteou to famish: but
he casteth away the substanc of the wick

10:4 he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of
the dilig maketh rich

10:5 he that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth
in harvest is a son that causeth shame

10:6 bless are upon the head of the just: but violenc covereth
the mouth of the wick

10:7 the memori of the just is blessed: but the name of the wick
shall rot

10:8 the wise in heart will receiv commandments: but a prate fool
shall fall

10:9 he that walketh uprightli walketh surely: but he that perverteth
hi way shall be known

10:10 he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prate fool
shall fall

10:11 the mouth of a righteou man is a well of life: but violenc
covereth the mouth of the wick

10:12 hatr stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sin

10:13 in the lip of him that hath understand wisdom is found: but
a rod is for the back of him that is void of understand

10:14 wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near
destruct

10:15 the rich man wealth is hi strong city: the destruct of the
poor is their poverti

10:16 the labour of the righteou tendeth to life: the fruit of the
wick to sin

10:17 he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
refuseth reproof erreth

10:18 he that hideth hatr with lie lip and he that uttereth a
slander is a fool

10:19 in the multitud of word there wanteth not sin: but he that
refraineth hi lip is wise

10:20 the tongu of the just is as choic silver: the heart of the
wick is littl worth

10:21 the lip of the righteou feed many: but fool die for want of
wisdom

10:22 the bless of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no
sorrow with it

10:23 it is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
understand hath wisdom

10:24 the fear of the wick it shall come upon him: but the desir
of the righteou shall be grant

10:25 as the whirlwind passeth so is the wick no more: but the
righteou is an everlast foundat

10:26 as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eye so is the
sluggard to them that send him

10:27 the fear of the lord prolongeth days: but the year of the
wick shall be shorten

10:28 the hope of the righteou shall be gladness: but the expect
of the wick shall perish

10:29 the way of the lord is strength to the upright: but destruct
shall be to the worker of iniqu

10:30 the righteou shall never be removed: but the wick shall not
inhabit the earth

10:31 the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
tongu shall be cut out

10:32 the lip of the righteou know what is acceptable: but the mouth
of the wick speaketh froward

11:1 a fals balanc is abomin to the lord: but a just weight is
hi delight

11:2 when pride cometh then cometh shame: but with the lowli is
wisdom

11:3 the integr of the upright shall guid them: but the
pervers of transgressor shall destroy them

11:4 rich profit not in the day of wrath: but righteous
delivereth from death

11:5 the righteous of the perfect shall direct hi way: but the
wick shall fall by hi own wicked

11:6 the righteous of the upright shall deliv them: but
transgressor shall be taken in their own naughti

11:7 when a wick man dieth hi expect shall perish: and the
hope of unjust men perisheth

11:8 the righteou is deliv out of troubl and the wick cometh
in hi stead

11:9 an hypocrit with hi mouth destroyeth hi neighbour: but through
knowledg shall the just be deliv

11:10 when it goeth well with the righteou the citi rejoiceth: and
when the wick perish there is shout

11:11 by the bless of the upright the citi is exalted: but it is
overthrown by the mouth of the wick

11:12 he that is void of wisdom despiseth hi neighbour: but a man of
understand holdeth hi peac

11:13 a talebear revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faith
spirit concealeth the matter

11:14 where no counsel is the peopl fall: but in the multitud of
counsellor there is safeti

11:15 he that is sureti for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that
hateth suretiship is sure

11:16 a graciou woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain rich

11:17 the merci man doeth good to hi own soul: but he that is
cruel troubleth hi own flesh

11:18 the wick worketh a deceit work: but to him that soweth
righteous shall be a sure reward

11:19 as righteous tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
pursueth it to hi own death

11:20 they that are of a froward heart are abomin to the lord:
but such as are upright in their way are hi delight

11:21 though hand join in hand the wick shall not be unpunished:
but the seed of the righteou shall be deliv

11:22 as a jewel of gold in a swine snout so is a fair woman which
is without discret

11:23 the desir of the righteou is onli good: but the expect of
the wick is wrath

11:24 there is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and there is that
withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverti

11:25 the liber soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
be water also himself

11:26 he that withholdeth corn the peopl shall curs him: but
bless shall be upon the head of him that selleth it

11:27 he that dilig seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
seeketh mischief it shall come unto him

11:28 he that trusteth in hi rich shall fall; but the righteou
shall flourish as a branch

11:29 he that troubleth hi own hous shall inherit the wind: and the
fool shall be servant to the wise of heart

11:30 the fruit of the righteou is a tree of life; and he that
winneth soul is wise

11:31 behold the righteou shall be recompens in the earth: much
more the wick and the sinner

12:1 whoso loveth instruct loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
reproof is brutish

12:2 a good man obtaineth favour of the lord: but a man of wick
devic will he condemn

12:3 a man shall not be establish by wickedness: but the root of the
righteou shall not be move

12:4 a virtuou woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh
asham is as rotten in hi bone

12:5 the thought of the righteou are right: but the counsel of the
wick are deceit

12:6 the word of the wick are to lie in wait for blood: but the
mouth of the upright shall deliv them

12:7 the wick are overthrown and are not: but the hous of the
righteou shall stand

12:8 a man shall be commend accord to hi wisdom: but he that is
of a pervers heart shall be despis

12:9 he that is despis and hath a servant is better than he that
honoureth himself and lacketh bread

12:10 a righteou man regardeth the life of hi beast: but the tender
merci of the wick are cruel

12:11 he that tilleth hi land shall be satisfi with bread: but he
that followeth vain person is void of understand

12:12 the wick desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
righteou yieldeth fruit

12:13 the wick is snare by the transgress of hi lips: but the
just shall come out of troubl

12:14 a man shall be satisfi with good by the fruit of hi mouth:
and the recomp of a man hand shall be render unto him

12:15 the way of a fool is right in hi own eyes: but he that
hearkeneth unto counsel is wise

12:16 a fool wrath is present known: but a prudent man covereth
shame

12:17 he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a fals
wit deceit

12:18 there is that speaketh like the pierc of a sword: but the
tongu of the wise is health

12:19 the lip of truth shall be establish for ever: but a lie
tongu is but for a moment

12:20 deceit is in the heart of them that imagin evil: but to the
counsellor of peac is joy

12:21 there shall no evil happen to the just: but the wick shall be
fill with mischief

12:22 lie lip are abomin to the lord: but they that deal truli
are hi delight

12:23 a prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fool
proclaimeth foolish

12:24 the hand of the dilig shall bear rule: but the sloth shall
be under tribut

12:25 heavi in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
maketh it glad

12:26 the righteou is more excel than hi neighbour: but the way
of the wick seduceth them

12:27 the sloth man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but
the substanc of a dilig man is preciou

12:28 in the way of righteous is life: and in the pathway thereof
there is no death

13:1 a wise son heareth hi father instruction: but a scorner
heareth not rebuk

13:2 a man shall eat good by the fruit of hi mouth: but the soul of
the transgressor shall eat violenc

13:3 he that keepeth hi mouth keepeth hi life: but he that openeth
wide hi lip shall have destruct

13:4 the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing: but the soul
of the dilig shall be made fat

13:5 a righteou man hateth lying: but a wick man is loathsom and
cometh to shame

13:6 righteous keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
wicked overthroweth the sinner

13:7 there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing: there is
that maketh himself poor yet hath great rich

13:8 the ransom of a man life are hi riches: but the poor heareth
not rebuk

13:9 the light of the righteou rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wick
shall be put out

13:10 onli by pride cometh contention: but with the well advis is
wisdom

13:11 wealth gotten by vaniti shall be diminished: but he that
gathereth by labour shall increas

13:12 hope defer maketh the heart sick: but when the desir cometh
it is a tree of life

13:13 whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth
the command shall be reward

13:14 the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the
snare of death

13:15 good understand giveth favour: but the way of transgressor
is hard

13:16 everi prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open
hi folli

13:17 a wick messeng falleth into mischief: but a faith
ambassador is health

13:18 poverti and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but
he that regardeth reproof shall be honour

13:19 the desir accomplish is sweet to the soul: but it is
abomin to fool to depart from evil

13:20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of
fool shall be destroy

13:21 evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteou good shall be
repay

13:22 a good man leaveth an inherit to hi children children:
and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just

13:23 much food is in the tillag of the poor: but there is that is
destroy for want of judgment

13:24 he that spareth hi rod hateth hi son: but he that loveth him
chasteneth him betim

13:25 the righteou eateth to the satisfi of hi soul: but the
belli of the wick shall want

14:1 everi wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it
down with her hand

14:2 he that walketh in hi upright feareth the lord: but he that
is pervers in hi way despiseth him

14:3 in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lip of
the wise shall preserv them

14:4 where no oxen are the crib is clean: but much increas is by the
strength of the ox

14:5 a faith wit will not lie: but a fals wit will utter
lie

14:6 a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not: but knowledg is
easi unto him that understandeth

14:7 go from the presenc of a foolish man when thou perceivest not
in him the lip of knowledg

14:8 the wisdom of the prudent is to understand hi way: but the folli
of fool is deceit

14:9 fool make a mock at sin: but among the righteou there is
favour

14:10 the heart knoweth hi own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
intermeddl with hi joy

14:11 the hous of the wick shall be overthrown: but the tabernacl
of the upright shall flourish

14:12 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the way of death

14:13 even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
mirth is heavi

14:14 the backslid in heart shall be fill with hi own ways: and a
good man shall be satisfi from himself

14:15 the simpl believeth everi word: but the prudent man looketh
well to hi go

14:16 a wise man feareth and departeth from evil: but the fool
rageth and is confid

14:17 he that is soon angri dealeth foolishly: and a man of wick
devic is hate

14:18 the simpl inherit folly: but the prudent are crown with
knowledg

14:19 the evil bow befor the good; and the wick at the gate of the
righteou

14:20 the poor is hate even of hi own neighbour: but the rich hath
mani friend

14:21 he that despiseth hi neighbour sinneth: but he that hath merci
on the poor happi is he

14:22 do they not err that devis evil? but merci and truth shall be
to them that devis good

14:23 in all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lip tendeth
onli to penuri

14:24 the crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolish of
fool is folli

14:25 a true wit delivereth souls: but a deceit wit
speaketh lie

14:26 in the fear of the lord is strong confidence: and hi children
shall have a place of refug

14:27 the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the
snare of death

14:28 in the multitud of peopl is the king honour: but in the want
of peopl is the destruct of the princ

14:29 he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that
is hasti of spirit exalteth folli

14:30 a sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envi the rotten
of the bone

14:31 he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth hi maker: but he that
honoureth him hath merci on the poor

14:32 the wick is driven away in hi wickedness: but the righteou
hath hope in hi death

14:33 wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but
that which is in the midst of fool is made known

14:34 righteous exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to ani
peopl

14:35 the king favour is toward a wise servant: but hi wrath is
against him that causeth shame

15:1 a soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievou word stir up
anger

15:2 the tongu of the wise useth knowledg aright: but the mouth of
fool poureth out foolish

15:3 the eye of the lord are in everi place behold the evil and
the good

15:4 a wholesom tongu is a tree of life: but pervers therein is
a breach in the spirit

15:5 a fool despiseth hi father instruction: but he that regardeth
reproof is prudent

15:6 in the hous of the righteou is much treasure: but in the
revenu of the wick is troubl

15:7 the lip of the wise dispers knowledge: but the heart of the
foolish doeth not so

15:8 the sacrific of the wick is an abomin to the lord: but
the prayer of the upright is hi delight

15:9 the way of the wick is an abomin unto the lord: but he
loveth him that followeth after righteous

15:10 correct is grievou unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
that hateth reproof shall die

15:11 hell and destruct are befor the lord: how much more then the
heart of the children of men? 15:12 a scorner loveth not one that
reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise

15:13 a merri heart maketh a cheer countenance: but by sorrow of
the heart the spirit is broken

15:14 the heart of him that hath understand seeketh knowledge: but
the mouth of fool feedeth on foolish

15:15 all the day of the afflict are evil: but he that is of a
merri heart hath a continu feast

15:16 better is littl with the fear of the lord than great treasur
and troubl therewith

15:17 better is a dinner of herb where love is than a stall ox and
hatr therewith

15:18 a wrath man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger
appeaseth strife

15:19 the way of the sloth man is as an hedg of thorns: but the
way of the righteou is made plain

15:20 a wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth hi
mother

15:21 folli is joy to him that is destitut of wisdom: but a man of
understand walketh uprightli

15:22 without counsel purpos are disappointed: but in the multitud
of counsellor they are establish

15:23 a man hath joy by the answer of hi mouth: and a word spoken in
due season how good is it! 15:24 the way of life is abov to the
wise that he may depart from hell beneath

15:25 the lord will destroy the hous of the proud: but he will
establish the border of the widow

15:26 the thought of the wick are an abomin to the lord: but
the word of the pure are pleasant word

15:27 he that is greedi of gain troubleth hi own house; but he that
hateth gift shall live

15:28 the heart of the righteou studieth to answer: but the mouth of
the wick poureth out evil thing

15:29 the lord is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
the righteou

15:30 the light of the eye rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
maketh the bone fat

15:31 the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise

15:32 he that refuseth instruct despiseth hi own soul: but he that
heareth reproof getteth understand

15:33 the fear of the lord is the instruct of wisdom; and befor
honour is humil

16:1 the prepar of the heart in man and the answer of the
tongu is from the lord

16:2 all the way of a man are clean in hi own eyes; but the lord
weigheth the spirit

16:3 commit thi work unto the lord and thi thought shall be
establish

16:4 the lord hath made all thing for himself: yea even the wick
for the day of evil

16:5 everi one that is proud in heart is an abomin to the lord:
though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunish

16:6 by merci and truth iniqu is purged: and by the fear of the
lord men depart from evil

16:7 when a man way pleas the lord he maketh even hi enemi to
be at peac with him

16:8 better is a littl with righteous than great revenu without
right

16:9 a man heart deviseth hi way: but the lord directeth hi step

16:10 a divin sentenc is in the lip of the king: hi mouth
transgresseth not in judgment

16:11 a just weight and balanc are the lords: all the weight of the
bag are hi work

16:12 it is an abomin to king to commit wickedness: for the
throne is establish by righteous

16:13 righteou lip are the delight of kings; and they love him that
speaketh right

16:14 the wrath of a king is as messeng of death: but a wise man
will pacifi it

16:15 in the light of the king counten is life; and hi favour
is as a cloud of the latter rain

16:16 how much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
understand rather to be chosen than silver! 16:17 the highway of
the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth hi way preserveth
hi soul

16:18 pride goeth befor destruct and an haughti spirit befor a
fall

16:19 better it is to be of an humbl spirit with the lowli than to
divid the spoil with the proud

16:20 he that handleth a matter wise shall find good: and whoso
trusteth in the lord happi is he

16:21 the wise in heart shall be call prudent: and the sweet of
the lip increaseth learn

16:22 understand is a wellspr of life unto him that hath it: but
the instruct of fool is folli

16:23 the heart of the wise teacheth hi mouth and addeth learn to
hi lip

16:24 pleasant word are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and
health to the bone

16:25 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the way of death

16:26 he that laboureth laboureth for himself; for hi mouth craveth
it of him

16:27 an ungodli man diggeth up evil: and in hi lip there is as a
burn fire

16:28 a froward man soweth strife: and a whisper separateth chief
friend

16:29 a violent man enticeth hi neighbour and leadeth him into the
way that is not good

16:30 he shutteth hi eye to devis froward things: move hi lip
he bringeth evil to pass

16:31 the hoari head is a crown of glori if it be found in the way of
righteous

16:32 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth hi spirit than he that taketh a citi

16:33 the lot is cast into the lap; but the whole dispos thereof is
of the lord

17:1 better is a dri morsel and quiet therewith than an hous
full of sacrific with strife

17:2 a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and
shall have part of the inherit among the brethren

17:3 the fine pot is for silver and the furnac for gold: but the
lord trieth the heart

17:4 a wick doer giveth heed to fals lips; and a liar giveth ear to
a naughti tongu

17:5 whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth hi maker: and he that is glad
at calam shall not be unpunish

17:6 children children are the crown of old men; and the glori of
children are their father

17:7 excel speech becometh not a fool: much less do lie lip a
princ

17:8 a gift is as a preciou stone in the eye of him that hath it:
whithersoev it turneth it prospereth

17:9 he that covereth a transgress seeketh love; but he that
repeateth a matter separateth veri friend

17:10 a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundr stripe
into a fool

17:11 an evil man seeketh onli rebellion: therefor a cruel messeng
shall be sent against him

17:12 let a bear rob of her whelp meet a man rather than a fool
in hi folli

17:13 whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from hi
hous

17:14 the begin of strife is as when one letteth out water:
therefor leav off content befor it be meddl with

17:15 he that justifieth the wick and he that condemneth the just
even they both are abomin to the lord

17:16 wherefor is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom
see he hath no heart to it? 17:17 a friend loveth at all time
and a brother is born for advers

17:18 a man void of understand striketh hand and becometh sureti
in the presenc of hi friend

17:19 he loveth transgress that loveth strife: and he that exalteth
hi gate seeketh destruct

17:20 he that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a
pervers tongu falleth into mischief

17:21 he that begetteth a fool doeth it to hi sorrow: and the father
of a fool hath no joy

17:22 a merri heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
drieth the bone

17:23 a wick man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the way
of judgment

17:24 wisdom is befor him that hath understanding; but the eye of a
fool are in the end of the earth

17:25 a foolish son is a grief to hi father and bitter to her
that bare him

17:26 also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princ for
equiti

17:27 he that hath knowledg spareth hi words: and a man of
understand is of an excel spirit

17:28 even a fool when he holdeth hi peac is count wise: and he
that shutteth hi lip is esteem a man of understand

18:1 through desir a man have separ himself seeketh and
intermeddleth with all wisdom

18:2 a fool hath no delight in understand but that hi heart may
discov itself

18:3 when the wick cometh then cometh also contempt and with
ignomini reproach

18:4 the word of a man mouth are as deep water and the wellspr
of wisdom as a flow brook

18:5 it is not good to accept the person of the wick to overthrow
the righteou in judgment

18:6 a fool lip enter into content and hi mouth calleth for
stroke

18:7 a fool mouth is hi destruct and hi lip are the snare of
hi soul

18:8 the word of a talebear are as wound and they go down into
the innermost part of the belli

18:9 he also that is sloth in hi work is brother to him that is a
great waster

18:10 the name of the lord is a strong tower: the righteou runneth
into it and is safe

18:11 the rich man wealth is hi strong citi and as an high wall in
hi own conceit

18:12 befor destruct the heart of man is haughti and befor
honour is humil

18:13 he that answereth a matter befor he heareth it it is folli and
shame unto him

18:14 the spirit of a man will sustain hi infirmity; but a wound
spirit who can bear? 18:15 the heart of the prudent getteth
knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledg

18:16 a man gift maketh room for him and bringeth him befor great
men

18:17 he that is first in hi own caus seemeth just; but hi
neighbour cometh and searcheth him

18:18 the lot causeth content to ceas and parteth between the
mighti

18:19 a brother offend is harder to be won than a strong city: and
their content are like the bar of a castl

18:20 a man belli shall be satisfi with the fruit of hi mouth;
and with the increas of hi lip shall he be fill

18:21 death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
love it shall eat the fruit thereof

18:22 whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour
of the lord

18:23 the poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughli

18:24 a man that hath friend must shew himself friendly: and there is
a friend that sticketh closer than a brother

19:1 better is the poor that walketh in hi integr than he that is
pervers in hi lip and is a fool

19:2 also that the soul be without knowledg it is not good; and he
that hasteth with hi feet sinneth

19:3 the foolish of man perverteth hi way: and hi heart fretteth
against the lord

19:4 wealth maketh mani friends; but the poor is separ from hi
neighbour

19:5 a fals wit shall not be unpunish and he that speaketh
lie shall not escap

19:6 mani will intreat the favour of the prince: and everi man is a
friend to him that giveth gift

19:7 all the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do hi
friend go far from him? he pursueth them with word yet they are
want to him

19:8 he that getteth wisdom loveth hi own soul: he that keepeth
understand shall find good

19:9 a fals wit shall not be unpunish and he that speaketh
lie shall perish

19:10 delight is not seemli for a fool; much less for a servant to
have rule over princ

19:11 the discret of a man deferreth hi anger; and it is hi glori
to pass over a transgress

19:12 the king wrath is as the roar of a lion; but hi favour is
as dew upon the grass

19:13 a foolish son is the calam of hi father: and the content
of a wife are a continu drop

19:14 hous and rich are the inherit of fathers: and a prudent
wife is from the lord

19:15 sloth casteth into a deep sleep; and an idl soul shall
suffer hunger

19:16 he that keepeth the command keepeth hi own soul; but he
that despiseth hi way shall die

19:17 he that hath piti upon the poor lendeth unto the lord; and that
which he hath given will he pay him again

19:18 chasten thi son while there is hope and let not thi soul spare
for hi cri

19:19 a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
deliv him yet thou must do it again

19:20 hear counsel and receiv instruct that thou mayest be wise
in thi latter end

19:21 there are mani devic in a man heart; nevertheless the
counsel of the lord that shall stand

19:22 the desir of a man is hi kindness: and a poor man is better
than a liar

19:23 the fear of the lord tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall
abid satisfied; he shall not be visit with evil

19:24 a sloth man hideth hi hand in hi bosom and will not so
much as bring it to hi mouth again

19:25 smite a scorner and the simpl will beware: and reprov one
that hath understand and he will understand knowledg

19:26 he that wasteth hi father and chaseth away hi mother is a
son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach

19:27 ceas my son to hear the instruct that causeth to err from
the word of knowledg

19:28 an ungodli wit scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
wick devoureth iniqu

19:29 judgment are prepar for scorner and stripe for the back of
fool

20:1 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging: and whosoev is
deceiv therebi is not wise

20:2 the fear of a king is as the roar of a lion: whoso provoketh
him to anger sinneth against hi own soul

20:3 it is an honour for a man to ceas from strife: but everi fool
will be meddl

20:4 the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefor shall
he beg in harvest and have noth

20:5 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
understand will draw it out

20:6 most men will proclaim everi one hi own goodness: but a faith
man who can find? 20:7 the just man walketh in hi integrity: hi
children are bless after him

20:8 a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all
evil with hi eye

20:9 who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin?
20:10 diver weight and diver measur both of them are alik
abomin to the lord

20:11 even a child is known by hi do whether hi work be pure
and whether it be right

20:12 the hear ear and the see eye the lord hath made even
both of them

20:13 love not sleep lest thou come to poverty; open thine eye and
thou shalt be satisfi with bread

20:14 it is naught it is naught saith the buyer: but when he is gone
hi way then he boasteth

20:15 there is gold and a multitud of rubies: but the lip of
knowledg are a preciou jewel

20:16 take hi garment that is sureti for a stranger: and take a
pledg of him for a strang woman

20:17 bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterward hi mouth
shall be fill with gravel

20:18 everi purpos is establish by counsel: and with good advic
make war

20:19 he that goeth about as a talebear revealeth secrets: therefor
meddl not with him that flattereth with hi lip

20:20 whoso curseth hi father or hi mother hi lamp shall be put
out in obscur dark

20:21 an inherit may be gotten hastili at the beginning; but the
end thereof shall not be bless

20:22 say not thou i will recompens evil; but wait on the lord and
he shall save thee

20:23 diver weight are an abomin unto the lord; and a fals
balanc is not good

20:24 man go are of the lord; how can a man then understand hi
own way? 20:25 it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is
holi and after vow to make enquiri

20:26 a wise king scattereth the wick and bringeth the wheel over
them

20:27 the spirit of man is the candl of the lord search all the
inward part of the belli

20:28 merci and truth preserv the king: and hi throne is upholden by
merci

20:29 the glori of young men is their strength: and the beauti of old
men is the grey head

20:30 the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripe the
inward part of the belli

21:1 the king heart is in the hand of the lord as the river of
water: he turneth it whithersoev he will

21:2 everi way of a man is right in hi own eyes: but the lord
pondereth the heart

21:3 to do justic and judgment is more accept to the lord than
sacrific

21:4 an high look and a proud heart and the plow of the wick
is sin

21:5 the thought of the dilig tend onli to plenteousness; but of
everi one that is hasti onli to want

21:6 the get of treasur by a lie tongu is a vaniti toss to
and fro of them that seek death

21:7 the robberi of the wick shall destroy them; becaus they refus
to do judgment

21:8 the way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure hi
work is right

21:9 it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawl woman in a wide hous

21:10 the soul of the wick desireth evil: hi neighbour findeth no
favour in hi eye

21:11 when the scorner is punish the simpl is made wise: and when
the wise is instruct he receiveth knowledg

21:12 the righteou man wise considereth the hous of the wicked:
but god overthroweth the wick for their wicked

21:13 whoso stoppeth hi ear at the cri of the poor he also shall
cri himself but shall not be heard

21:14 a gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
strong wrath

21:15 it is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruct shall be
to the worker of iniqu

21:16 the man that wandereth out of the way of understand shall
remain in the congreg of the dead

21:17 he that loveth pleasur shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine
and oil shall not be rich

21:18 the wick shall be a ransom for the righteou and the
transgressor for the upright

21:19 it is better to dwell in the wilder than with a contenti
and an angri woman

21:20 there is treasur to be desir and oil in the dwell of the
wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up

21:21 he that followeth after righteous and merci findeth life
righteous and honour

21:22 a wise man scaleth the citi of the mighti and casteth down the
strength of the confid thereof

21:23 whoso keepeth hi mouth and hi tongu keepeth hi soul from
troubl

21:24 proud and haughti scorner is hi name who dealeth in proud
wrath

21:25 the desir of the sloth killeth him; for hi hand refus to
labour

21:26 he coveteth greedili all the day long: but the righteou giveth
and spareth not

21:27 the sacrific of the wick is abomination: how much more when
he bringeth it with a wick mind? 21:28 a fals wit shall
perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantli

21:29 a wick man hardeneth hi face: but as for the upright he
directeth hi way

21:30 there is no wisdom nor understand nor counsel against the
lord

21:31 the hors is prepar against the day of battle: but safeti is
of the lord

22:1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great rich and love
favour rather than silver and gold

22:2 the rich and poor meet together: the lord is the maker of them
all

22:3 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself: but the
simpl pass on and are punish

22:4 by humil and the fear of the lord are rich and honour and
life

22:5 thorn and snare are in the way of the froward: he that doth
keep hi soul shall be far from them

22:6 train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old he
will not depart from it

22:7 the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrow is servant to the
lender

22:8 he that soweth iniqu shall reap vanity: and the rod of hi
anger shall fail

22:9 he that hath a bounti eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of
hi bread to the poor

22:10 cast out the scorner and content shall go out; yea strife
and reproach shall ceas

22:11 he that loveth pure of heart for the grace of hi lip the
king shall be hi friend

22:12 the eye of the lord preserv knowledg and he overthroweth the
word of the transgressor

22:13 the sloth man saith there is a lion without i shall be
slain in the street

22:14 the mouth of strang women is a deep pit: he that is abhor of
the lord shall fall therein

22:15 foolish is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
correct shall drive it far from him

22:16 he that oppresseth the poor to increas hi rich and he that
giveth to the rich shall sure come to want

22:17 bow down thine ear and hear the word of the wise and appli
thine heart unto my knowledg

22:18 for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
shall withal be fit in thi lip

22:19 that thi trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee
thi day even to thee

22:20 have not i written to thee excel thing in counsel and
knowledg 22:21 that i might make thee know the certainti of the
word of truth; that thou mightest answer the word of truth to them
that send unto thee? 22:22 rob not the poor becaus he is poor:
neither oppress the afflict in the gate: 22:23 for the lord will
plead their caus and spoil the soul of those that spoil them

22:24 make no friendship with an angri man; and with a furiou man
thou shalt not go: 22:25 lest thou learn hi way and get a snare to
thi soul

22:26 be not thou one of them that strike hand or of them that are
sureti for debt

22:27 if thou hast noth to pay whi should he take away thi bed
from under thee? 22:28 remov not the ancient landmark which thi
father have set

22:29 seest thou a man dilig in hi business? he shall stand befor
kings; he shall not stand befor mean men

23:1 when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consid dilig what
is befor thee: 23:2 and put a knife to thi throat if thou be a man
given to appetit

23:3 be not desir of hi dainties: for they are deceit meat

23:4 labour not to be rich: ceas from thine own wisdom

23:5 wilt thou set thine eye upon that which is not? for rich
certainli make themselv wings; they fli away as an eagl toward
heaven

23:6 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither
desir thou hi dainti meats: 23:7 for as he thinketh in hi heart so
is he: eat and drink saith he to thee; but hi heart is not with
thee

23:8 the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose
thi sweet word

23:9 speak not in the ear of a fool: for he will despis the wisdom
of thi word

23:10 remov not the old landmark; and enter not into the field of
the fatherless: 23:11 for their redeem is mighty; he shall plead
their caus with thee

23:12 appli thine heart unto instruct and thine ear to the word
of knowledg

23:13 withhold not correct from the child: for if thou beatest him
with the rod he shall not die

23:14 thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliv hi soul
from hell

23:15 my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoic even
mine

23:16 yea my rein shall rejoic when thi lip speak right thing

23:17 let not thine heart envi sinners: but be thou in the fear of the
lord all the day long

23:18 for sure there is an end; and thine expect shall not be
cut off

23:19 hear thou my son and be wise and guid thine heart in the
way

23:20 be not among winebibbers; among riotou eater of flesh: 23:21
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsi
shall cloth a man with rag

23:22 hearken unto thi father that begat thee and despis not thi
mother when she is old

23:23 buy the truth and sell it not; also wisdom and instruct
and understand

23:24 the father of the righteou shall greatli rejoice: and he that
begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him

23:25 thi father and thi mother shall be glad and she that bare thee
shall rejoic

23:26 my son give me thine heart and let thine eye observ my way

23:27 for a whore is a deep ditch; and a strang woman is a narrow
pit

23:28 she also lieth in wait as for a prey and increaseth the
transgressor among men

23:29 who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
babbling? who hath wound without cause? who hath red of eyes?
23:30 they that tarri long at the wine; they that go to seek mix
wine

23:31 look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth hi
colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright

23:32 at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder

23:33 thine eye shall behold strang women and thine heart shall
utter pervers thing

23:34 yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
sea or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast

23:35 they have stricken me shalt thou say and i wa not sick; they
have beaten me and i felt it not: when shall i awake? i will seek it
yet again

24:1 be not thou enviou against evil men neither desir to be with
them

24:2 for their heart studieth destruct and their lip talk of
mischief

24:3 through wisdom is an hous builded; and by understand it is
established: 24:4 and by knowledg shall the chamber be fill with
all preciou and pleasant rich

24:5 a wise man is strong; yea a man of knowledg increaseth
strength

24:6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thi war: and in multitud of
counsellor there is safeti

24:7 wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not hi mouth in the
gate

24:8 he that deviseth to do evil shall be call a mischiev person

24:9 the thought of foolish is sin: and the scorner is an
abomin to men

24:10 if thou faint in the day of advers thi strength is small

24:11 if thou forbear to deliv them that are drawn unto death and
those that are readi to be slain; 24:12 if thou sayest behold we
knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consid it? and he
that keepeth thi soul doth not he know it? and shall not he render to
everi man accord to hi works? 24:13 my son eat thou honey
becaus it is good; and the honeycomb which is sweet to thi taste:
24:14 so shall the knowledg of wisdom be unto thi soul: when thou
hast found it then there shall be a reward and thi expect shall
not be cut off

24:15 lay not wait o wick man against the dwell of the
righteous; spoil not hi rest place: 24:16 for a just man falleth
seven time and riseth up again: but the wick shall fall into
mischief

24:17 rejoic not when thine enemi falleth and let not thine heart be
glad when he stumbleth: 24:18 lest the lord see it and it displeas
him and he turn away hi wrath from him

24:19 fret not thyself becaus of evil men neither be thou enviou at
the wicked: 24:20 for there shall be no reward to the evil man; the
candl of the wick shall be put out

24:21 my son fear thou the lord and the king: and meddl not with
them that are given to change: 24:22 for their calam shall rise
suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 24:23 these thing
also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of person in
judgment

24:24 he that saith unto the wick thou are righteous; him shall the
peopl curs nation shall abhor him: 24:25 but to them that rebuk
him shall be delight and a good bless shall come upon them

24:26 everi man shall kiss hi lip that giveth a right answer

24:27 prepar thi work without and make it fit for thyself in the
field; and afterward build thine hous

24:28 be not a wit against thi neighbour without cause; and
deceiv not with thi lip

24:29 say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me: i will
render to the man accord to hi work

24:30 i went by the field of the sloth and by the vineyard of the
man void of understanding; 24:31 and lo it wa all grown over with
thorn and nettl had cover the face thereof and the stone wall
thereof wa broken down

24:32 then i saw and consid it well: i look upon it and
receiv instruct

24:33 yet a littl sleep a littl slumber a littl fold of the
hand to sleep: 24:34 so shall thi poverti come as one that
travelleth; and thi want as an arm man

25:1 these are also proverb of solomon which the men of hezekiah
king of judah copi out

25:2 it is the glori of god to conceal a thing: but the honour of
king is to search out a matter

25:3 the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of
king is unsearch

25:4 take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a
vessel for the finer

25:5 take away the wick from befor the king and hi throne shall
be establish in righteous

25:6 put not forth thyself in the presenc of the king and stand not
in the place of great men: 25:7 for better it is that it be said unto
thee come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the
presenc of the princ whom thine eye have seen

25:8 go not forth hastili to strive lest thou know not what to do in
the end thereof when thi neighbour hath put thee to shame

25:9 debat thi caus with thi neighbour himself; and discov not a
secret to another: 25:10 lest he that heareth it put thee to shame
and thine infami turn not away

25:11 a word fitli spoken is like appl of gold in pictur of
silver

25:12 as an ear of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a
wise reprov upon an obedi ear

25:13 as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faith
messeng to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of hi
master

25:14 whoso boasteth himself of a fals gift is like cloud and wind
without rain

25:15 by long forbear is a princ persuad and a soft tongu
breaketh the bone

25:16 hast thou found honey? eat so much as is suffici for thee
lest thou be fill therewith and vomit it

25:17 withdraw thi foot from thi neighbour house; lest he be weari
of thee and so hate thee

25:18 a man that beareth fals wit against hi neighbour is a
maul and a sword and a sharp arrow

25:19 confid in an unfaith man in time of troubl is like a
broken tooth and a foot out of joint

25:20 as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar
upon nitr so is he that singeth song to an heavi heart

25:21 if thine enemi be hungri give him bread to eat; and if he be
thirsti give him water to drink: 25:22 for thou shalt heap coal of
fire upon hi head and the lord shall reward thee

25:23 the north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angri counten a
backbit tongu

25:24 it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a
brawl woman and in a wide hous

25:25 as cold water to a thirsti soul so is good news from a far
countri

25:26 a righteou man fall down befor the wick is as a troubl
fountain and a corrupt spring

25:27 it is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own
glori is not glori

25:28 he that hath no rule over hi own spirit is like a citi that is
broken down and without wall

26:1 as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not
seemli for a fool

26:2 as the bird by wander as the swallow by fli so the curs
causeless shall not come

26:3 a whip for the hors a bridl for the ass and a rod for the
fool back

26:4 answer not a fool accord to hi folli lest thou also be like
unto him

26:5 answer a fool accord to hi folli lest he be wise in hi own
conceit

26:6 he that sendeth a messag by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
feet and drinketh damag

26:7 the leg of the lame are not equal: so is a parabl in the mouth
of fool

26:8 as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth
honour to a fool

26:9 as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parabl
in the mouth of fool

26:10 the great god that form all thing both rewardeth the fool
and rewardeth transgressor

26:11 as a dog returneth to hi vomit so a fool returneth to hi
folli

26:12 seest thou a man wise in hi own conceit? there is more hope of
a fool than of him

26:13 the sloth man saith there is a lion in the way; a lion is in
the street

26:14 as the door turneth upon hi hing so doth the sloth upon
hi bed

26:15 the sloth hideth hi hand in hi bosom; it grieveth him to
bring it again to hi mouth

26:16 the sluggard is wiser in hi own conceit than seven men that can
render a reason

26:17 he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belong not to
him is like one that taketh a dog by the ear

26:18 as a mad man who casteth firebrand arrow and death 26:19 so
is the man that deceiveth hi neighbour and saith am not i in sport?
26:20 where no wood is there the fire goeth out: so where there is no
talebear the strife ceaseth

26:21 as coal are to burn coal and wood to fire; so is a
contenti man to kindl strife

26:22 the word of a talebear are as wound and they go down into
the innermost part of the belli

26:23 burn lip and a wick heart are like a potsherd cover with
silver dross

26:24 he that hateth dissembleth with hi lip and layeth up deceit
within him; 26:25 when he speaketh fair believ him not: for there
are seven abomin in hi heart

26:26 whose hatr is cover by deceit hi wicked shall be
shew befor the whole congreg

26:27 whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
stone it will return upon him

26:28 a lie tongu hateth those that are afflict by it; and a
flatter mouth worketh ruin

27:1 boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day
may bring forth

27:2 let anoth man prais thee and not thine own mouth; a stranger
and not thine own lip

27:3 a stone is heavi and the sand weighty; but a fool wrath is
heavier than them both

27:4 wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous; but who is abl to stand
befor envy? 27:5 open rebuk is better than secret love

27:6 faith are the wound of a friend; but the kiss of an enemi
are deceit

27:7 the full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungri soul everi
bitter thing is sweet

27:8 as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that
wandereth from hi place

27:9 ointment and perfum rejoic the heart: so doth the sweet of
a man friend by hearti counsel

27:10 thine own friend and thi father friend forsak not; neither
go into thi brother hous in the day of thi calamity: for better is
a neighbour that is near than a brother far off

27:11 my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him
that reproacheth me

27:12 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself; but the
simpl pass on and are punish

27:13 take hi garment that is sureti for a stranger and take a
pledg of him for a strang woman

27:14 he that blesseth hi friend with a loud voic rise earli in
the morn it shall be count a curs to him

27:15 a continu drop in a veri raini day and a contenti woman
are alik

27:16 whosoev hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of hi
right hand which bewrayeth itself

27:17 iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the counten of hi
friend

27:18 whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
that waiteth on hi master shall be honour

27:19 as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man

27:20 hell and destruct are never full; so the eye of man are
never satisfi

27:21 as the fine pot for silver and the furnac for gold; so is a
man to hi prais

27:22 though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
pestl yet will not hi foolish depart from him

27:23 be thou dilig to know the state of thi flock and look well
to thi herd

27:24 for rich are not for ever: and doth the crown endur to everi
generation? 27:25 the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth
itself and herb of the mountain are gather

27:26 the lamb are for thi cloth and the goat are the price of
the field

27:27 and thou shalt have goat milk enough for thi food for the
food of thi household and for the mainten for thi maiden

28:1 the wick flee when no man pursueth: but the righteou are bold
as a lion

28:2 for the transgress of a land mani are the princ thereof: but
by a man of understand and knowledg the state thereof shall be
prolong

28:3 a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweep rain which
leaveth no food

28:4 they that forsak the law prais the wicked: but such as keep the
law contend with them

28:5 evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the lord
understand all thing

28:6 better is the poor that walketh in hi upright than he that
is pervers in hi way though he be rich

28:7 whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion
of riotou men shameth hi father

28:8 he that by usuri and unjust gain increaseth hi substanc he
shall gather it for him that will piti the poor

28:9 he that turneth away hi ear from hear the law even hi
prayer shall be abomin

28:10 whoso causeth the righteou to go astray in an evil way he
shall fall himself into hi own pit: but the upright shall have good
thing in possess

28:11 the rich man is wise in hi own conceit; but the poor that hath
understand searcheth him out

28:12 when righteou men do rejoic there is great glory: but when
the wick rise a man is hidden

28:13 he that covereth hi sin shall not prosper: but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have merci

28:14 happi is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth hi
heart shall fall into mischief

28:15 as a roar lion and a rang bear; so is a wick ruler over
the poor peopl

28:16 the princ that wanteth understand is also a great oppressor:
but he that hateth covet shall prolong hi day

28:17 a man that doeth violenc to the blood of ani person shall flee
to the pit; let no man stay him

28:18 whoso walketh uprightli shall be saved: but he that is pervers
in hi way shall fall at onc

28:19 he that tilleth hi land shall have plenti of bread: but he that
followeth after vain person shall have poverti enough

28:20 a faith man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
hast to be rich shall not be innoc

28:21 to have respect of person is not good: for for a piec of bread
that man will transgress

28:22 he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not
that poverti shall come upon him

28:23 he that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favour than he
that flattereth with the tongu

28:24 whoso robbeth hi father or hi mother and saith it is no
transgression; the same is the companion of a destroy

28:25 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
putteth hi trust in the lord shall be made fat

28:26 he that trusteth in hi own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
wise he shall be deliv

28:27 he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth
hi eye shall have mani a curs

28:28 when the wick rise men hide themselves: but when they perish
the righteou increas

29:1 he that be often reprov hardeneth hi neck shall suddenli
be destroy and that without remedi

29:2 when the righteou are in author the peopl rejoice: but when
the wick beareth rule the peopl mourn

29:3 whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth hi father: but he that keepeth
compani with harlot spendeth hi substanc

29:4 the king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth
gift overthroweth it

29:5 a man that flattereth hi neighbour spreadeth a net for hi feet

29:6 in the transgress of an evil man there is a snare: but the
righteou doth sing and rejoic

29:7 the righteou considereth the caus of the poor: but the wick
regardeth not to know it

29:8 scorn men bring a citi into a snare: but wise men turn away
wrath

29:9 if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or
laugh there is no rest

29:10 the bloodthirsti hate the upright: but the just seek hi soul

29:11 a fool uttereth all hi mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till
afterward

29:12 if a ruler hearken to lie all hi servant are wick

29:13 the poor and the deceit man meet together: the lord
lighteneth both their eye

29:14 the king that faith judgeth the poor hi throne shall be
establish for ever

29:15 the rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
bringeth hi mother to shame

29:16 when the wick are multipli transgress increaseth: but
the righteou shall see their fall

29:17 correct thi son and he shall give thee rest; yea he shall give
delight unto thi soul

29:18 where there is no vision the peopl perish: but he that keepeth
the law happi is he

29:19 a servant will not be correct by words: for though he
understand he will not answer

29:20 seest thou a man that is hasti in hi words? there is more hope
of a fool than of him

29:21 he that delic bringeth up hi servant from a child shall
have him becom hi son at the length

29:22 an angri man stirreth up strife and a furiou man aboundeth in
transgress

29:23 a man pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
humbl in spirit

29:24 whoso is partner with a thief hateth hi own soul: he heareth
curs and bewrayeth it not

29:25 the fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth hi trust in
the lord shall be safe

29:26 mani seek the ruler favour; but everi man judgment cometh
from the lord

29:27 an unjust man is an abomin to the just: and he that is
upright in the way is abomin to the wick

30:1 the word of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy: the man
spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal 30:2 sure i am more
brutish than ani man and have not the understand of a man

30:3 i neither learn wisdom nor have the knowledg of the holi

30:4 who hath ascend up into heaven or descended? who hath gather
the wind in hi fists? who hath bound the water in a garment? who
hath establish all the end of the earth? what is hi name and what
is hi son name if thou canst tell? 30:5 everi word of god is
pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him

30:6 add thou not unto hi word lest he reprov thee and thou be
found a liar

30:7 two thing have i requir of thee; deni me them not befor i
die: 30:8 remov far from me vaniti and lies: give me neither poverti
nor riches; feed me with food conveni for me: 30:9 lest i be full
and deni thee and say who is the lord? or lest i be poor and steal
and take the name of my god in vain

30:10 accus not a servant unto hi master lest he curs thee and
thou be found guilti

30:11 there is a gener that curseth their father and doth not
bless their mother

30:12 there is a gener that are pure in their own eye and yet
is not wash from their filthi

30:13 there is a gener o how lofti are their eyes! and their
eyelid are lift up

30:14 there is a gener whose teeth are as sword and their jaw
teeth as knive to devour the poor from off the earth and the needi
from among men

30:15 the horseleach hath two daughter cri give give there are
three thing that are never satisfi yea four thing say not it is
enough: 30:16 the grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not
fill with water; and the fire that saith not it is enough

30:17 the eye that mocketh at hi father and despiseth to obey hi
mother the raven of the valley shall pick it out and the young
eagl shall eat it

30:18 there be three thing which are too wonder for me yea four
which i know not: 30:19 the way of an eagl in the air; the way of a
serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and
the way of a man with a maid

30:20 such is the way of an adulter woman; she eateth and wipeth
her mouth and saith i have done no wicked

30:21 for three thing the earth is disquiet and for four which it
cannot bear: 30:22 for a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he
is fill with meat; 30:23 for an odiou woman when she is married;
and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress

30:24 there be four thing which are littl upon the earth but they
are exceed wise: 30:25 the ant are a peopl not strong yet they
prepar their meat in the summer; 30:26 the coni are but a feebl
folk yet make they their hous in the rocks; 30:27 the locust have
no king yet go they forth all of them by bands; 30:28 the spider
taketh hold with her hand and is in king palac

30:29 there be three thing which go well yea four are come in
going: 30:30 a lion which is strongest among beast and turneth not
away for any; 30:31 a greyhound; an he goat also; and a king against
whom there is no rise up

30:32 if thou hast done foolishli in lift up thyself or if thou
hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thi mouth

30:33 sure the churn of milk bringeth forth butter and the
wring of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forc of wrath
bringeth forth strife

31:1 the word of king lemuel the propheci that hi mother taught
him

31:2 what my son? and what the son of my womb? and what the son of
my vows? 31:3 give not thi strength unto women nor thi way to that
which destroyeth king

31:4 it is not for king o lemuel it is not for king to drink wine;
nor for princ strong drink: 31:5 lest they drink and forget the
law and pervert the judgment of ani of the afflict

31:6 give strong drink unto him that is readi to perish and wine unto
those that be of heavi heart

31:7 let him drink and forget hi poverti and rememb hi miseri no
more

31:8 open thi mouth for the dumb in the caus of all such as are
appoint to destruct

31:9 open thi mouth judg righteous and plead the caus of the
poor and needi

31:10 who can find a virtuou woman? for her price is far abov
rubi

31:11 the heart of her husband doth safe trust in her so that he
shall have no need of spoil

31:12 she will do him good and not evil all the day of her life

31:13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingli with her
hand

31:14 she is like the merchant ships; she bringeth her food from
afar

31:15 she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her
household and a portion to her maiden

31:16 she considereth a field and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
hand she planteth a vineyard

31:17 she girdeth her loin with strength and strengtheneth her arm

31:18 she perceiveth that her merchandis is good: her candl goeth
not out by night

31:19 she layeth her hand to the spindl and her hand hold the
distaff

31:20 she stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea she reacheth forth
her hand to the needi

31:21 she is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
household are cloth with scarlet

31:22 she maketh herself cover of tapestry; her cloth is silk
and purpl

31:23 her husband is known in the gate when he sitteth among the
elder of the land

31:24 she maketh fine linen and selleth it; and delivereth girdl
unto the merchant

31:25 strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoic in
time to come

31:26 she openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongu is the law
of kind

31:27 she looketh well to the way of her household and eateth not
the bread of idl

31:28 her children aris up and call her blessed; her husband also
and he praiseth her

31:29 mani daughter have done virtuous but thou excellest them
all

31:30 favour is deceit and beauti is vain: but a woman that
feareth the lord she shall be prais

31:31 give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own work prais
her in the gate




ecclesiast

or

the preacher


1:1 the word of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem

1:2 vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher vaniti of vanities; all is
vaniti

1:3 what profit hath a man of all hi labour which he taketh under the
sun? 1:4 one gener passeth away and anoth gener cometh:
but the earth abideth for ever

1:5 the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to hi
place where he aros

1:6 the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north;
it whirleth about continu and the wind returneth again accord
to hi circuit

1:7 all the river run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the
place from whenc the river come thither they return again

1:8 all thing are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not
satisfi with see nor the ear fill with hear

1:9 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be; and that
which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing
under the sun

1:10 is there ani thing whereof it may be said see thi is new? it
hath been alreadi of old time which wa befor us

1:11 there is no remembr of former things; neither shall there be
ani remembr of thing that are to come with those that shall come
after

1:12 i the preacher wa king over israel in jerusalem

1:13 and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern
all thing that are done under heaven: thi sore travail hath god
given to the son of man to be exercis therewith

1:14 i have seen all the work that are done under the sun; and
behold all is vaniti and vexat of spirit

1:15 that which is crook cannot be made straight: and that which is
want cannot be number

1:16 i commun with mine own heart say lo i am come to great
estat and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
befor me in jerusalem: yea my heart had great experi of wisdom
and knowledg

1:17 and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know mad and
folly: i perceiv that thi also is vexat of spirit

1:18 for in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledg increaseth sorrow

2:1 i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth
therefor enjoy pleasure: and behold thi also is vaniti

2:2 i said of laughter it is mad: and of mirth what doeth it? 2:3 i
sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquaint mine
heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folli till i might see what wa
that good for the son of men which they should do under the heaven
all the day of their life

2:4 i made me great works; i build me houses; i plant me
vineyards: 2:5 i made me garden and orchard and i plant tree in
them of all kind of fruits: 2:6 i made me pool of water to water
therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 2:7 i got me servant
and maiden and had servant born in my house; also i had great
possess of great and small cattl abov all that were in jerusalem
befor me: 2:8 i gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar
treasur of king and of the provinces: i gat me men singer and women
singer and the delight of the son of men as music instrument
and that of all sort

2:9 so i wa great and increas more than all that were befor me in
jerusalem: also my wisdom remain with me

2:10 and whatsoev mine eye desir i kept not from them i withheld
not my heart from ani joy; for my heart rejoic in all my labour: and
thi wa my portion of all my labour

2:11 then i look on all the work that my hand had wrought and on
the labour that i had labour to do: and behold all wa vaniti and
vexat of spirit and there wa no profit under the sun

2:12 and i turn myself to behold wisdom and mad and folly: for
what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath
been alreadi done

2:13 then i saw that wisdom excelleth folli as far as light excelleth
dark

2:14 the wise man eye are in hi head; but the fool walketh in
darkness: and i myself perceiv also that one event happeneth to them
all

2:15 then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it
happeneth even to me; and whi wa i then more wise? then i said in my
heart that thi also is vaniti

2:16 for there is no remembr of the wise more than of the fool for
ever; see that which now is in the day to come shall all be
forgotten

and how dieth the wise man? as the fool

2:17 therefor i hate life; becaus the work that is wrought under
the sun is grievou unto me: for all is vaniti and vexat of spirit

2:18 yea i hate all my labour which i had taken under the sun:
becaus i should leav it unto the man that shall be after me

2:19 and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have labour and
wherein i have shew myself wise under the sun thi is also vaniti

2:20 therefor i went about to caus my heart to despair of all the
labour which i took under the sun

2:21 for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledg
and in equity; yet to a man that hath not labour therein shall he
leav it for hi portion thi also is vaniti and a great evil

2:22 for what hath man of all hi labour and of the vexat of hi
heart wherein he hath labour under the sun? 2:23 for all hi day
are sorrow and hi travail grief; yea hi heart taketh not rest in
the night thi is also vaniti

2:24 there is noth better for a man than that he should eat and
drink and that he should make hi soul enjoy good in hi labour thi
also i saw that it wa from the hand of god

2:25 for who can eat or who els can hasten hereunto more than i?
2:26 for god giveth to a man that is good in hi sight wisdom and
knowledg and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and
to heap up that he may give to him that is good befor god thi also
is vaniti and vexat of spirit

3:1 to everi thing there is a season and a time to everi purpos
under the heaven: 3:2 a time to be born and a time to die; a time to
plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 3:3 a time to
kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build
up; 3:4 a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a
time to dance; 3:5 a time to cast away stone and a time to gather
stone together; a time to embrac and a time to refrain from
embracing; 3:6 a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and
a time to cast away; 3:7 a time to rend and a time to sew; a time to
keep silenc and a time to speak; 3:8 a time to love and a time to
hate; a time of war and a time of peac

3:9 what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
3:10 i have seen the travail which god hath given to the son of men
to be exercis in it

3:11 he hath made everi thing beauti in hi time: also he hath set
the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that
god maketh from the begin to the end

3:12 i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoic
and to do good in hi life

3:13 and also that everi man should eat and drink and enjoy the good
of all hi labour it is the gift of god

3:14 i know that whatsoev god doeth it shall be for ever: noth
can be put to it nor ani thing taken from it: and god doeth it that
men should fear befor him

3:15 that which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath alreadi
been; and god requireth that which is past

3:16 and moreov i saw under the sun the place of judgment that
wicked wa there; and the place of righteous that iniqu
wa there

3:17 i said in mine heart god shall judg the righteou and the
wicked: for there is a time there for everi purpos and for everi
work

3:18 i said in mine heart concern the estat of the son of men
that god might manifest them and that they might see that they
themselv are beast

3:19 for that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beasts; even
one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth so dieth the other; yea
they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preemin abov a
beast: for all is vaniti

3:20 all go unto one place; all are of the dust and all turn to dust
again

3:21 who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 3:22 wherefor i
perceiv that there is noth better than that a man should rejoic
in hi own works; for that is hi portion: for who shall bring him to
see what shall be after him? 4:1 so i return and consid all
the oppress that are done under the sun: and behold the tear of
such as were oppress and they had no comforter; and on the side of
their oppressor there wa power; but they had no comfort

4:2 wherefor i prais the dead which are alreadi dead more than the
live which are yet aliv

4:3 yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun

4:4 again i consid all travail and everi right work that for
thi a man is envi of hi neighbour thi is also vaniti and
vexat of spirit

4:5 the fool foldeth hi hand togeth and eateth hi own flesh

4:6 better is an hand with quiet than both the hand full with
travail and vexat of spirit

4:7 then i return and i saw vaniti under the sun

4:8 there is one alon and there is not a second; yea he hath
neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all hi labour;
neither is hi eye satisfi with riches; neither saith he for whom
do i labour and bereav my soul of good? thi is also vaniti yea it
is a sore travail

4:9 two are better than one; becaus they have a good reward for their
labour

4:10 for if they fall the one will lift up hi fellow: but woe to him
that is alon when he falleth; for he hath not anoth to help him up

4:11 again if two lie togeth then they have heat: but how can one
be warm alone? 4:12 and if one prevail against him two shall
withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickli broken

4:13 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king
who will no more be admonish

4:14 for out of prison he cometh to reign; wherea also he that is
born in hi kingdom becometh poor

4:15 i consid all the live which walk under the sun with the
second child that shall stand up in hi stead

4:16 there is no end of all the peopl even of all that have been
befor them: they also that come after shall not rejoic in him
sure thi also is vaniti and vexat of spirit

5:1 keep thi foot when thou goest to the hous of god and be more
readi to hear than to give the sacrific of fools: for they consid
not that they do evil

5:2 be not rash with thi mouth and let not thine heart be hasti to
utter ani thing befor god: for god is in heaven and thou upon earth:
therefor let thi word be few

5:3 for a dream cometh through the multitud of business; and a fool
voic is known by multitud of word

5:4 when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it; for he hath
no pleasur in fools: pay that which thou hast vow

5:5 better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest
vow and not pay

5:6 suffer not thi mouth to caus thi flesh to sin; neither say thou
befor the angel that it wa an error: wherefor should god be angri
at thi voic and destroy the work of thine hands? 5:7 for in the
multitud of dream and mani word there are also diver vanities: but
fear thou god

5:8 if thou seest the oppress of the poor and violent pervert
of judgment and justic in a provinc marvel not at the matter: for
he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than
they

5:9 moreov the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is
serv by the field

5:10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfi with silver; nor he
that loveth abund with increase: thi is also vaniti

5:11 when good increas they are increas that eat them: and what
good is there to the owner thereof save the behold of them with
their eyes? 5:12 the sleep of a labour man is sweet whether he
eat littl or much: but the abund of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep

5:13 there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun name
rich kept for the owner thereof to their hurt

5:14 but those rich perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son
and there is noth in hi hand

5:15 as he came forth of hi mother womb nake shall he return to
go as he came and shall take noth of hi labour which he may
carri away in hi hand

5:16 and thi also is a sore evil that in all point as he came so
shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath labour for the wind?
5:17 all hi day also he eateth in dark and he hath much sorrow
and wrath with hi sick

5:18 behold that which i have seen: it is good and come for one to
eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all hi labour that he
taketh under the sun all the day of hi life which god giveth him:
for it is hi portion

5:19 everi man also to whom god hath given rich and wealth and hath
given him power to eat thereof and to take hi portion and to
rejoic in hi labour; thi is the gift of god

5:20 for he shall not much rememb the day of hi life; becaus god
answereth him in the joy of hi heart

6:1 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common
among men: 6:2 a man to whom god hath given rich wealth and
honour so that he wanteth noth for hi soul of all that he
desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger
eateth it: thi is vaniti and it is an evil diseas

6:3 if a man beget an hundr children and live mani year so that
the day of hi year be mani and hi soul be not fill with good
and also that he have no burial; i say that an untim birth is
better than he

6:4 for he cometh in with vaniti and departeth in dark and hi
name shall be cover with dark

6:5 moreov he hath not seen the sun nor known ani thing: thi hath
more rest than the other

6:6 yea though he live a thousand year twice told yet hath he seen
no good: do not all go to one place? 6:7 all the labour of man is for
hi mouth and yet the appetit is not fill

6:8 for what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor
that knoweth to walk befor the living? 6:9 better is the sight of
the eye than the wander of the desire: thi is also vaniti and
vexat of spirit

6:10 that which hath been is name alreadi and it is known that it is
man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he

6:11 see there be mani thing that increas vaniti what is man the
better? 6:12 for who knoweth what is good for man in thi life all
the day of hi vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? 7:1 a good name is
better than preciou ointment; and the day of death than the day of
one birth

7:2 it is better to go to the hous of mourn than to go to the
hous of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the live will
lay it to hi heart

7:3 sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sad of the
counten the heart is made better

7:4 the heart of the wise is in the hous of mourning; but the heart
of fool is in the hous of mirth

7:5 it is better to hear the rebuk of the wise than for a man to
hear the song of fool

7:6 for as the crackl of thorn under a pot so is the laughter of
the fool: thi also is vaniti

7:7 sure oppress maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
heart

7:8 better is the end of a thing than the begin thereof: and the
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit

7:9 be not hasti in thi spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fool

7:10 say not thou what is the caus that the former day were better
than these? for thou dost not enquir wise concern thi

7:11 wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun

7:12 for wisdom is a defenc and money is a defence: but the
excel of knowledg is that wisdom giveth life to them that have
it

7:13 consid the work of god: for who can make that straight which
he hath made crooked? 7:14 in the day of prosper be joy but in
the day of advers consider: god also hath set the one over against
the other to the end that man should find noth after him

7:15 all thing have i seen in the day of my vanity: there is a just
man that perisheth in hi righteous and there is a wick man
that prolongeth hi life in hi wicked

7:16 be not righteou over much; neither make thyself over wise: whi
shouldest thou destroy thyself ? 7:17 be not over much wick
neither be thou foolish: whi shouldest thou die befor thi time? 7:18
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea also from thi
withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth god shall come forth of
them all

7:19 wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighti men which are
in the citi

7:20 for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and
sinneth not

7:21 also take no heed unto all word that are spoken; lest thou hear
thi servant curs thee: 7:22 for oftentim also thine own heart
knoweth that thou thyself likewis hast curs other

7:23 all thi have i prove by wisdom: i said i will be wise; but it
wa far from me

7:24 that which is far off and exceed deep who can find it out?
7:25 i appli mine heart to know and to search and to seek out
wisdom and the reason of thing and to know the wicked of folli
even of foolish and madness: 7:26 and i find more bitter than
death the woman whose heart is snare and net and her hand as
bands: whoso pleaseth god shall escap from her; but the sinner shall
be taken by her

7:27 behold thi have i found saith the preacher count one by
one to find out the account: 7:28 which yet my soul seeketh but i
find not: one man among a thousand have i found; but a woman among all
those have i not found

7:29 lo thi onli have i found that god hath made man upright; but
they have sought out mani invent

8:1 who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpret of a
thing? a man wisdom maketh hi face to shine and the bold of
hi face shall be chang

8:2 i counsel thee to keep the king command and that in regard
of the oath of god

8:3 be not hasti to go out of hi sight: stand not in an evil thing;
for he doeth whatsoev pleaseth him

8:4 where the word of a king is there is power: and who may say unto
him what doest thou? 8:5 whoso keepeth the command shall feel no
evil thing: and a wise man heart discerneth both time and judgment

8:6 becaus to everi purpos there is time and judgment therefor the
miseri of man is great upon him

8:7 for he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when
it shall be? 8:8 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and
there is no discharg in that war; neither shall wicked deliv
those that are given to it

8:9 all thi have i seen and appli my heart unto everi work that is
done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over
anoth to hi own hurt

8:10 and so i saw the wick buri who had come and gone from the
place of the holi and they were forgotten in the citi where they had
so done: thi is also vaniti

8:11 becaus sentenc against an evil work is not execut speedili
therefor the heart of the son of men is fulli set in them to do
evil

8:12 though a sinner do evil an hundr time and hi day be
prolong yet sure i know that it shall be well with them that fear
god which fear befor him: 8:13 but it shall not be well with the
wick neither shall he prolong hi day which are as a shadow;
becaus he feareth not befor god

8:14 there is a vaniti which is done upon the earth; that there be
just men unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wicked;
again there be wick men to whom it happeneth accord to the work
of the righteous: i said that thi also is vaniti

8:15 then i commend mirth becaus a man hath no better thing under
the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry: for that shall
abid with him of hi labour the day of hi life which god giveth
him under the sun

8:16 when i appli mine heart to know wisdom and to see the busi
that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor
night seeth sleep with hi eyes:) 8:17 then i beheld all the work of
god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun:
becaus though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it;
yea farther; though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be
abl to find it

9:1 for all thi i consid in my heart even to declar all thi
that the righteou and the wise and their work are in the hand of
god: no man knoweth either love or hatr by all that is befor them

9:2 all thing come alik to all: there is one event to the righteou
and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean;
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the
good so is the sinner; and he that sweareth as he that feareth an
oath

9:3 thi is an evil among all thing that are done under the sun that
there is one event unto all: yea also the heart of the son of men is
full of evil and mad is in their heart while they live and after
that they go to the dead

9:4 for to him that is join to all the live there is hope: for a
live dog is better than a dead lion

9:5 for the live know that they shall die: but the dead know not ani
thing neither have they ani more a reward; for the memori of them is
forgotten

9:6 also their love and their hatr and their envi is now
perished; neither have they ani more a portion for ever in ani thing
that is done under the sun

9:7 go thi way eat thi bread with joy and drink thi wine with a
merri heart; for god now accepteth thi work

9:8 let thi garment be alway white; and let thi head lack no
ointment

9:9 live joy with the wife whom thou lovest all the day of the
life of thi vaniti which he hath given thee under the sun all the
day of thi vanity: for that is thi portion in thi life and in thi
labour which thou takest under the sun

9:10 whatsoev thi hand findeth to do do it with thi might; for
there is no work nor devic nor knowledg nor wisdom in the grave
whither thou goest

9:11 i return and saw under the sun that the race is not to the
swift nor the battl to the strong neither yet bread to the wise
nor yet rich to men of understand nor yet favour to men of
skill; but time and chanc happeneth to them all

9:12 for man also knoweth not hi time: as the fish that are taken
in an evil net and as the bird that are caught in the snare; so are
the son of men snare in an evil time when it falleth suddenli upon
them

9:13 thi wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seem great
unto me: 9:14 there wa a littl citi and few men within it; and
there came a great king against it and besieg it and built great
bulwark against it: 9:15 now there wa found in it a poor wise man
and he by hi wisdom deliv the city; yet no man rememb that
same poor man

9:16 then said i wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
poor man wisdom is despis and hi word are not heard

9:17 the word of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cri of him
that ruleth among fool

9:18 wisdom is better than weapon of war: but one sinner destroyeth
much good

10:1 dead fli caus the ointment of the apothecari to send forth a
stink savour: so doth a littl folli him that is in reput for
wisdom and honour

10:2 a wise man heart is at hi right hand; but a fool heart at
hi left

10:3 yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way hi wisdom
faileth him and he saith to everi one that he is a fool

10:4 if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leav not thi
place; for yield pacifieth great offenc

10:5 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error
which proceedeth from the ruler: 10:6 folli is set in great digniti
and the rich sit in low place

10:7 i have seen servant upon hors and princ walk as servant
upon the earth

10:8 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
hedg a serpent shall bite him

10:9 whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith; and he that
cleaveth wood shall be endang therebi

10:10 if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edg then must he
put to more strength: but wisdom is profit to direct

10:11 sure the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler
is no better

10:12 the word of a wise man mouth are gracious; but the lip of a
fool will swallow up himself

10:13 the begin of the word of hi mouth is foolishness: and the
end of hi talk is mischiev mad

10:14 a fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
and what shall be after him who can tell him? 10:15 the labour of
the foolish wearieth everi one of them becaus he knoweth not how to
go to the citi

10:16 woe to thee o land when thi king is a child and thi princ
eat in the morning! 10:17 bless art thou o land when thi king is
the son of nobl and thi princ eat in due season for strength
and not for drunkenness! 10:18 by much sloth the build
decayeth; and through idl of the hand the hous droppeth
through

10:19 a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all thing

10:20 curs not the king no not in thi thought; and curs not the
rich in thi bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carri the voic
and that which hath wing shall tell the matter

11:1 cast thi bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after mani
day

11:2 give a portion to seven and also to eight; for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth

11:3 if the cloud be full of rain they empti themselv upon the
earth: and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in
the place where the tree falleth there it shall be

11:4 he that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth
the cloud shall not reap

11:5 as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the
bone do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou
knowest not the work of god who maketh all

11:6 in the morn sow thi seed and in the even withhold not
thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either thi or
that or whether they both shall be alik good

11:7 truli the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eye
to behold the sun: 11:8 but if a man live mani year and rejoic in
them all; yet let him rememb the day of darkness; for they shall be
mani all that cometh is vaniti

11:9 rejoic o young man in thi youth; and let thi heart cheer thee
in the day of thi youth and walk in the way of thine heart and in
the sight of thine eyes: but know thou that for all these thing god
will bring thee into judgment

11:10 therefor remov sorrow from thi heart and put away evil from
thi flesh: for childhood and youth are vaniti

12:1 rememb now thi creator in the day of thi youth while the evil
day come not nor the year draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no
pleasur in them; 12:2 while the sun or the light or the moon or
the star be not darken nor the cloud return after the rain: 12:3
in the day when the keeper of the hous shall trembl and the strong
men shall bow themselv and the grinder ceas becaus they are few
and those that look out of the window be darken 12:4 and the door
shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grind is low
and he shall rise up at the voic of the bird and all the daughter
of musick shall be brought low; 12:5 also when they shall be afraid of
that which is high and fear shall be in the way and the almond tree
shall flourish and the grasshopp shall be a burden and desir
shall fail: becaus man goeth to hi long home and the mourner go
about the streets: 12:6 or ever the silver cord be loos or the
golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or
the wheel broken at the cistern

12:7 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
shall return unto god who gave it

12:8 vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher; all is vaniti

12:9 and moreov becaus the preacher wa wise he still taught the
peopl knowledge; yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in
order mani proverb

12:10 the preacher sought to find out accept words: and that which
wa written wa upright even word of truth

12:11 the word of the wise are as goad and as nail fasten by the
master of assembl which are given from one shepherd

12:12 and further by these my son be admonished: of make mani
book there is no end; and much studi is a weari of the flesh

12:13 let us hear the conclus of the whole matter: fear god and
keep hi commandments: for thi is the whole duti of man

12:14 for god shall bring everi work into judgment with everi secret
thing whether it be good or whether it be evil

6:10 who is she that looketh forth as the morn fair as the moon

8:5 who is thi that cometh up from the wilder lean upon her
beloved? i rais thee up under the appl tree: there thi mother
brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee

8:6 set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm: for
love is strong as death; jealousi is cruel as the grave: the coal
thereof are coal of fire which hath a most vehement flame

8:7 mani water cannot quench love neither can the flood drown it:
if a man would give all the substanc of hi hous for love it would
utterli be contemn

8:8 we have a littl sister and she hath no breasts: what shall we do
for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? 8:9 if she be
a wall we will build upon her a palac of silver: and if she be a
door we will inclos her with board of cedar

8:10 i am a wall and my breast like towers: then wa i in hi eye
as one that found favour

8:11 solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto
keepers; everi one for the fruit thereof wa to bring a thousand
piec of silver

8:12 my vineyard which is mine is befor me: thou o solomon must
have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundr

8:13 thou that dwellest in the garden the companion hearken to thi
voice: caus me to hear it

8:14 make hast my belov and be thou like to a roe or to a young
hart upon the mountain of spice




the book of the prophet isaiah


1:1 the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concern
judah and jerusalem in the day of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah
king of judah

1:2 hear o heaven and give ear o earth: for the lord hath spoken
i have nourish and brought up children and they have rebel
against me

1:3 the ox knoweth hi owner and the ass hi master crib: but
israel doth not know my peopl doth not consid

1:4 ah sin nation a peopl laden with iniqu a seed of
evildo children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the lord
they have provok the holi one of israel unto anger they are gone
away backward

1:5 whi should ye be stricken ani more? ye will revolt more and more:
the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint

1:6 from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no sound
in it; but wound and bruis and putrifi sores: they have not
been close neither bound up neither mollifi with ointment

1:7 your countri is desol your citi are burn with fire: your
land stranger devour it in your presenc and it is desol as
overthrown by stranger

1:8 and the daughter of zion is left as a cottag in a vineyard as a
lodg in a garden of cucumb as a besieg citi

1:9 except the lord of host had left unto us a veri small remnant we
should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah

1:10 hear the word of the lord ye ruler of sodom; give ear unto the
law of our god ye peopl of gomorrah

1:11 to what purpos is the multitud of your sacrific unto me?
saith the lord: i am full of the burnt offer of ram and the fat
of fed beasts; and i delight not in the blood of bullock or of
lamb or of he goat

1:12 when ye come to appear befor me who hath requir thi at your
hand to tread my courts? 1:13 bring no more vain oblations; incens
is an abomin unto me; the new moon and sabbath the call of
assembl i cannot away with; it is iniqu even the solemn
meet

1:14 your new moon and your appoint feast my soul hateth: they are
a troubl unto me; i am weari to bear them

1:15 and when ye spread forth your hand i will hide mine eye from
you: yea when ye make mani prayer i will not hear: your hand are
full of blood

1:16 wash you make you clean; put away the evil of your do from
befor mine eyes; ceas to do evil; 1:17 learn to do well; seek
judgment reliev the oppress judg the fatherless plead for the
widow

1:18 come now and let us reason togeth saith the lord: though your
sin be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
like crimson they shall be as wool

1:19 if ye be will and obedi ye shall eat the good of the land:
1:20 but if ye refus and rebel ye shall be devour with the sword:
for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it

1:21 how is the faith citi becom an harlot! it wa full of
judgment; righteous lodg in it; but now murder

1:22 thi silver is becom dross thi wine mix with water: 1:23 thi
princ are rebelli and companion of thieves: everi one loveth
gift and followeth after rewards: they judg not the fatherless
neither doth the caus of the widow come unto them

1:24 therefor saith the lord the lord of host the mighti one of
israel ah i will eas me of mine adversari and aveng me of mine
enemies: 1:25 and i will turn my hand upon thee and pure purg away
thi dross and take away all thi tin: 1:26 and i will restor thi
judg as at the first and thi counsellor as at the beginning:
afterward thou shalt be call the citi of righteous the
faith citi

1:27 zion shall be redeem with judgment and her convert with
righteous

1:28 and the destruct of the transgressor and of the sinner shall
be togeth and they that forsak the lord shall be consum

1:29 for they shall be asham of the oak which ye have desir and
ye shall be confound for the garden that ye have chosen

1:30 for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that
hath no water

1:31 and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark
and they shall both burn togeth and none shall quench them

2:1 the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concern judah and
jerusalem

2:2 and it shall come to pass in the last day that the mountain of
the lord hous shall be establish in the top of the mountain and
shall be exalt abov the hills; and all nation shall flow unto it

2:3 and mani peopl shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the
mountain of the lord to the hous of the god of jacob; and he will
teach us of hi way and we will walk in hi paths: for out of zion
shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem

2:4 and he shall judg among the nation and shall rebuk mani
people: and they shall beat their sword into plowshar and their
spear into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against
nation neither shall they learn war ani more

2:5 o hous of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the
lord

2:6 therefor thou hast forsaken thi peopl the hous of jacob
becaus they be replenish from the east and are soothsay like
the philistin and they pleas themselv in the children of
stranger

2:7 their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there ani
end of their treasures; their land is also full of hors neither is
there ani end of their chariots: 2:8 their land also is full of idols;
they worship the work of their own hand that which their own finger
have made: 2:9 and the mean man boweth down and the great man
humbleth himself: therefor forgiv them not

2:10 enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the
lord and for the glori of hi majesti

2:11 the lofti look of man shall be humbl and the haughti of
men shall be bow down and the lord alon shall be exalt in that
day

2:12 for the day of the lord of host shall be upon everi one that is
proud and lofti and upon everi one that is lift up; and he shall be
brought low: 2:13 and upon all the cedar of lebanon that are high
and lift up and upon all the oak of bashan 2:14 and upon all the
high mountain and upon all the hill that are lift up 2:15 and
upon everi high tower and upon everi fenc wall 2:16 and upon all
the ship of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictur

2:17 and the lofti of man shall be bow down and the haughti
of men shall be made low: and the lord alon shall be exalt in that
day

2:18 and the idol he shall utterli abolish

2:19 and they shall go into the hole of the rock and into the cave
of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glori of hi majesti
when he ariseth to shake terribl the earth

2:20 in that day a man shall cast hi idol of silver and hi idol
of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the mole
and to the bats; 2:21 to go into the cleft of the rock and into the
top of the rag rock for fear of the lord and for the glori of
hi majesti when he ariseth to shake terribl the earth

2:22 ceas ye from man whose breath is in hi nostrils: for wherein
is he to be account of ? 3:1 for behold the lord the lord of
host doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the
staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water

3:2 the mighti man and the man of war the judg and the prophet
and the prudent and the ancient 3:3 the captain of fifti and the
honour man and the counsellor and the cun artific and the
eloqu orat

3:4 and i will give children to be their princ and babe shall rule
over them

3:5 and the peopl shall be oppress everi one by anoth and everi
one by hi neighbour: the child shall behav himself proudli against
the ancient and the base against the honour

3:6 when a man shall take hold of hi brother of the hous of hi
father say thou hast cloth be thou our ruler and let thi
ruin be under thi hand: 3:7 in that day shall he swear say i will
not be an healer; for in my hous is neither bread nor clothing: make
me not a ruler of the peopl

3:8 for jerusalem is ruin and judah is fallen: becaus their tongu
and their do are against the lord to provok the eye of hi
glori

3:9 the shew of their counten doth wit against them; and they
declar their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul! for
they have reward evil unto themselv

3:10 say ye to the righteou that it shall be well with him: for they
shall eat the fruit of their do

3:11 woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of
hi hand shall be given him

3:12 as for my peopl children are their oppressor and women rule
over them o my peopl they which lead thee caus thee to err and
destroy the way of thi path

3:13 the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judg the peopl

3:14 the lord will enter into judgment with the ancient of hi
peopl and the princ thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard;
the spoil of the poor is in your hous

3:15 what mean ye that ye beat my peopl to piec and grind the
face of the poor? saith the lord god of host

3:16 moreov the lord saith becaus the daughter of zion are
haughti and walk with stretch forth neck and wanton eye walk
and minc as they go and make a tinkl with their feet: 3:17
therefor the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the
daughter of zion and the lord will discov their secret part

3:18 in that day the lord will take away the braveri of their tinkl
ornament about their feet and their caul and their round tire
like the moon 3:19 the chain and the bracelet and the muffler
3:20 the bonnet and the ornament of the leg and the headband
and the tablet and the ear 3:21 the ring and nose jewel
3:22 the changeabl suit of apparel and the mantl and the
wimpl and the crisp pin 3:23 the glass and the fine linen
and the hood and the vail

3:24 and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there
shall be stink; and instead of a girdl a rent; and instead of well
set hair baldness; and instead of a stomach a gird of sackcloth;
and burn instead of beauti

3:25 thi men shall fall by the sword and thi mighti in the war

3:26 and her gate shall lament and mourn; and she be desol
shall sit upon the ground

4:1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man say we
will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel: onli let us be
call by thi name to take away our reproach

4:2 in that day shall the branch of the lord be beauti and
gloriou and the fruit of the earth shall be excel and come for
them that are escap of israel

4:3 and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he
that remaineth in jerusalem shall be call holi even everi one that
is written among the live in jerusalem: 4:4 when the lord shall have
wash away the filth of the daughter of zion and shall have purg
the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of
judgment and by the spirit of burn

4:5 and the lord will creat upon everi dwell place of mount zion
and upon her assembl a cloud and smoke by day and the shine of
a flame fire by night: for upon all the glori shall be a defenc

4:6 and there shall be a tabernacl for a shadow in the day time from
the heat and for a place of refug and for a covert from storm and
from rain

5:1 now will i sing to my wellbelov a song of my belov touch
hi vineyard my wellbelov hath a vineyard in a veri fruit hill:
5:2 and he fenc it and gather out the stone thereof and plant
it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and
also made a winepress therein: and he look that it should bring
forth grape and it brought forth wild grape

5:3 and now o inhabit of jerusalem and men of judah judg i
pray you betwixt me and my vineyard

5:4 what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not
done in it? wherefor when i look that it should bring forth
grape brought it forth wild grapes? 5:5 and now go to; i will tell
you what i will do to my vineyard: i will take away the hedg thereof
and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof and it
shall be trodden down: 5:6 and i will lay it waste: it shall not be
prune nor digged; but there shall come up brier and thorns: i will
also command the cloud that they rain no rain upon it

5:7 for the vineyard of the lord of host is the hous of israel and
the men of judah hi pleasant plant: and he look for judgment but
behold oppression; for righteous but behold a cri

5:8 woe unto them that join hous to hous that lay field to field
till there be no place that they may be place alon in the midst of
the earth! 5:9 in mine ear said the lord of host of a truth mani
hous shall be desol even great and fair without inhabit

5:10 yea ten acr of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of
an homer shall yield an ephah

5:11 woe unto them that rise up earli in the morn that they may
follow strong drink; that continu until night till wine inflam
them! 5:12 and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and
wine are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the lord
neither consid the oper of hi hand

5:13 therefor my peopl are gone into captiv becaus they have no
knowledge: and their honour men are famish and their multitud
dri up with thirst

5:14 therefor hell hath enlarg herself and open her mouth
without measure: and their glori and their multitud and their pomp
and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it

5:15 and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighti man shall
be humbl and the eye of the lofti shall be humbled: 5:16 but the
lord of host shall be exalt in judgment and god that is holi shall
be sanctifi in righteous

5:17 then shall the lamb feed after their manner and the wast
place of the fat one shall stranger eat

5:18 woe unto them that draw iniqu with cord of vaniti and sin as
it were with a cart rope: 5:19 that say let him make speed and
hasten hi work that we may see it: and let the counsel of the holi
one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it! 5:20 woe unto
them that call evil good and good evil; that put dark for light
and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for
bitter! 5:21 woe unto them that are wise in their own eye and
prudent in their own sight! 5:22 woe unto them that are mighti to
drink wine and men of strength to mingl strong drink: 5:23 which
justifi the wick for reward and take away the righteous of the
righteou from him! 5:24 therefor as the fire devoureth the stubbl
and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as
rotten and their blossom shall go up as dust: becaus they have
cast away the law of the lord of host and despis the word of the
holi one of israel

5:25 therefor is the anger of the lord kindl against hi peopl
and he hath stretch forth hi hand against them and hath smitten
them: and the hill did trembl and their carcas were torn in the
midst of the street

for all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch
out still

5:26 and he will lift up an ensign to the nation from far and will
hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and behold they shall come
with speed swiftly: 5:27 none shall be weari nor stumbl among them;
none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdl of their loin
be loos nor the latchet of their shoe be broken: 5:28 whose arrow
are sharp and all their bow bent their hors hoof shall be
count like flint and their wheel like a whirlwind: 5:29 their
roar shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions: yea
they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carri it away
safe and none shall deliv it

5:30 and in that day they shall roar against them like the roar of
the sea: and if one look unto the land behold dark and sorrow
and the light is darken in the heaven thereof

6:1 in the year that king uzziah die i saw also the lord sit upon
a throne high and lift up and hi train fill the templ

6:2 abov it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain
he cover hi face and with twain he cover hi feet and with
twain he did fli

6:3 and one cri unto anoth and said holi holi holi is the
lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of hi glori

6:4 and the post of the door move at the voic of him that cri
and the hous wa fill with smoke

6:5 then said i woe is me! for i am undone; becaus i am a man of
unclean lip and i dwell in the midst of a peopl of unclean lips:
for mine eye have seen the king the lord of host

6:6 then flew one of the seraphim unto me have a live coal in hi
hand which he had taken with the tong from off the altar: 6:7 and he
laid it upon my mouth and said lo thi hath touch thi lips; and
thine iniqu is taken away and thi sin purg

6:8 also i heard the voic of the lord say whom shall i send and
who will go for us? then said i here am i; send me

6:9 and he said go and tell thi peopl hear ye inde but
understand not; and see ye inde but perceiv not

6:10 make the heart of thi peopl fat and make their ear heavi and
shut their eyes; lest they see with their eye and hear with their
ear and understand with their heart and convert and be heal

6:11 then said i lord how long? and he answer until the citi be
wast without inhabit and the hous without man and the land be
utterli desol 6:12 and the lord have remov men far away and
there be a great forsak in the midst of the land

6:13 but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be
eaten: as a teil tree and as an oak whose substanc is in them when
they cast their leaves: so the holi seed shall be the substanc
thereof

7:1 and it came to pass in the day of ahaz the son of jotham the son
of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the
son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war
against it but could not prevail against it

7:2 and it wa told the hous of david say syria is confeder
with ephraim and hi heart wa move and the heart of hi peopl as
the tree of the wood are move with the wind

7:3 then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou
and shearjashub thi son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fuller field; 7:4 and say unto him take heed
and be quiet; fear not neither be faintheart for the two tail of
these smoke firebrand for the fierc anger of rezin with syria
and of the son of remaliah

7:5 becaus syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil
counsel against thee say 7:6 let us go up against judah and vex
it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the
midst of it even the son of tabeal: 7:7 thu saith the lord god it
shall not stand neither shall it come to pass

7:8 for the head of syria is damascu and the head of damascu is
rezin; and within threescor and five year shall ephraim be broken
that it be not a peopl

7:9 and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is
remaliah son if ye will not believ sure ye shall not be
establish

7:10 moreov the lord spake again unto ahaz say 7:11 ask thee a
sign of the lord thi god; ask it either in the depth or in the height
abov

7:12 but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord

7:13 and he said hear ye now o hous of david; is it a small thing
for you to weari men but will ye weari my god also? 7:14 therefor
the lord himself shall give you a sign; behold a virgin shall
conceiv and bear a son and shall call hi name immanuel

7:15 butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refus the
evil and choos the good

7:16 for befor the child shall know to refus the evil and choos
the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her
king

7:17 the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thi peopl and upon thi
father hous day that have not come from the day that ephraim
depart from judah; even the king of assyria

7:18 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss
for the fli that is in the uttermost part of the river of egypt and
for the bee that is in the land of assyria

7:19 and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desol
valley and in the hole of the rock and upon all thorn and upon
all bush

7:20 in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hire
name by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head
and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consum the beard

7:21 and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a
young cow and two sheep; 7:22 and it shall come to pass for the
abund of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter
and honey shall everi one eat that is left in the land

7:23 and it shall come to pass in that day that everi place shall be
where there were a thousand vine at a thousand silverl it shall
even be for brier and thorn

7:24 with arrow and with bow shall men come thither; becaus all the
land shall becom brier and thorn

7:25 and on all hill that shall be dig with the mattock there
shall not come thither the fear of brier and thorns: but it shall be
for the send forth of oxen and for the tread of lesser cattl

8:1 moreov the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write
in it with a man pen concern mahershalalhashbaz

8:2 and i took unto me faith wit to record uriah the priest
and zechariah the son of jeberechiah

8:3 and i went unto the prophetess; and she conceiv and bare a son

then said the lord to me call hi name mahershalalhashbaz

8:4 for befor the child shall have knowledg to cri my father and
my mother the rich of damascu and the spoil of samaria shall be
taken away befor the king of assyria

8:5 the lord spake also unto me again say 8:6 forasmuch as thi
peopl refuseth the water of shiloah that go softli and rejoic in
rezin and remaliah son; 8:7 now therefor behold the lord bringeth
up upon them the water of the river strong and mani even the king
of assyria and all hi glory: and he shall come up over all hi
channel and go over all hi banks: 8:8 and he shall pass through
judah; he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck;
and the stretch out of hi wing shall fill the breadth of thi
land o immanuel

8:9 associ yourselv o ye peopl and ye shall be broken in
pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries: gird yourselv and ye
shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselv and ye shall be broken in
piec

8:10 take counsel togeth and it shall come to nought; speak the
word and it shall not stand: for god is with us

8:11 for the lord spake thu to me with a strong hand and instruct
me that i should not walk in the way of thi peopl say 8:12 say
ye not a confederaci to all them to whom thi peopl shall say a
confederacy; neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid

8:13 sanctifi the lord of host himself; and let him be your fear and
let him be your dread

8:14 and he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbl and
for a rock of offenc to both the hous of israel for a gin and for
a snare to the inhabit of jerusalem

8:15 and mani among them shall stumbl and fall and be broken and
be snare and be taken

8:16 bind up the testimoni seal the law among my discipl

8:17 and i will wait upon the lord that hideth hi face from the
hous of jacob and i will look for him

8:18 behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for
sign and for wonder in israel from the lord of host which dwelleth
in mount zion

8:19 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have
familiar spirit and unto wizard that peep and that mutter: should
not a peopl seek unto their god? for the live to the dead? 8:20 to
the law and to the testimony: if they speak not accord to thi
word it is becaus there is no light in them

8:21 and they shall pass through it hardli bestead and hungry: and it
shall come to pass that when they shall be hungri they shall fret
themselv and curs their king and their god and look upward

8:22 and they shall look unto the earth; and behold troubl and
dark dim of anguish; and they shall be driven to dark

9:1 nevertheless the dim shall not be such as wa in her vexat
when at the first he lightli afflict the land of zebulun and the
land of naphtali and afterward did more grievous afflict her by the
way of the sea beyond jordan in galile of the nation

9:2 the peopl that walk in dark have seen a great light: they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the
light shine

9:3 thou hast multipli the nation and not increas the joy: they
joy befor thee accord to the joy in harvest and as men rejoic
when they divid the spoil

9:4 for thou hast broken the yoke of hi burden and the staff of hi
shoulder the rod of hi oppressor as in the day of midian

9:5 for everi battl of the warrior is with confus nois and
garment roll in blood; but thi shall be with burn and fuel of
fire

9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given: and the
govern shall be upon hi shoulder: and hi name shall be call
wonder counsellor the mighti god the everlast father the
princ of peac

9:7 of the increas of hi govern and peac there shall be no end
upon the throne of david and upon hi kingdom to order it and to
establish it with judgment and with justic from henceforth even for
ever the zeal of the lord of host will perform thi

9:8 the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath light upon israel

9:9 and all the peopl shall know even ephraim and the inhabit of
samaria that say in the pride and stout of heart 9:10 the brick
are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomor are
cut down but we will chang them into cedar

9:11 therefor the lord shall set up the adversari of rezin against
him and join hi enemi together; 9:12 the syrian befor and the
philistin behind; and they shall devour israel with open mouth for
all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out
still

9:13 for the peopl turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do
they seek the lord of host

9:14 therefor the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch
and rush in one day

9:15 the ancient and honour he is the head; and the prophet that
teacheth lie he is the tail

9:16 for the leader of thi peopl caus them to err; and they that
are led of them are destroy

9:17 therefor the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither
shall have merci on their fatherless and widows: for everi one is an
hypocrit and an evildo and everi mouth speaketh folli for all
thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out
still

9:18 for wicked burneth as the fire: it shall devour the brier
and thorn and shall kindl in the thicket of the forest and they
shall mount up like the lift up of smoke

9:19 through the wrath of the lord of host is the land darken and
the peopl shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare hi
brother

9:20 and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he
shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied: they
shall eat everi man the flesh of hi own arm: 9:21 manasseh ephraim;
and ephraim manasseh: and they togeth shall be against judah for
all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out
still

10:1 woe unto them that decre unright decre and that write
grievous which they have prescribed; 10:2 to turn asid the needi
from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my peopl
that widow may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless!
10:3 and what will ye do in the day of visit and in the
desol which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?
and where will ye leav your glory? 10:4 without me they shall bow
down under the prison and they shall fall under the slain for all
thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out
still

10:5 o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is
mine indign

10:6 i will send him against an hypocrit nation and against the
peopl of my wrath will i give him a charg to take the spoil and to
take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the street

10:7 howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth hi heart think so; but
it is in hi heart to destroy and cut off nation not a few

10:8 for he saith are not my princ altogeth kings? 10:9 is not
calno as carchemish? is not hamath as arpad? is not samaria as
damascus? 10:10 as my hand hath found the kingdom of the idol and
whose graven imag did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria; 10:11
shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idol so do to
jerusalem and her idols? 10:12 wherefor it shall come to pass that
when the lord hath perform hi whole work upon mount zion and on
jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
assyria and the glori of hi high look

10:13 for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by
my wisdom; for i am prudent: and i have remov the bound of the
peopl and have rob their treasur and i have put down the
inhabit like a valiant man: 10:14 and my hand hath found as a nest
the rich of the people: and as one gathereth egg that are left
have i gather all the earth; and there wa none that move the wing
or open the mouth or peep

10:15 shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
shall the saw magnifi itself against him that shaketh it? as if the
rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the
staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood

10:16 therefor shall the lord the lord of host send among hi fat
one leanness; and under hi glori he shall kindl a burn like the
burn of a fire

10:17 and the light of israel shall be for a fire and hi holi one
for a flame: and it shall burn and devour hi thorn and hi brier in
one day; 10:18 and shall consum the glori of hi forest and of hi
fruit field both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
standard-bear fainteth

10:19 and the rest of the tree of hi forest shall be few that a
child may write them

10:20 and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of
israel and such as are escap of the hous of jacob shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the lord the
holi one of israel in truth

10:21 the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the
mighti god

10:22 for though thi peopl israel be as the sand of the sea yet a
remnant of them shall return: the consumpt decre shall overflow
with righteous

10:23 for the lord god of host shall make a consumpt even
determin in the midst of all the land

10:24 therefor thu saith the lord god of host o my peopl that
dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian: he shall smite thee
with a rod and shall lift up hi staff against thee after the manner
of egypt

10:25 for yet a veri littl while and the indign shall ceas
and mine anger in their destruct

10:26 and the lord of host shall stir up a scourg for him accord
to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb: and as hi rod wa
upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt

10:27 and it shall come to pass in that day that hi burden shall be
taken away from off thi shoulder and hi yoke from off thi neck and
the yoke shall be destroy becaus of the anoint

10:28 he is come to aiath he is pass to migron; at michmash he hath
laid up hi carriages: 10:29 they are gone over the passage: they have
taken up their lodg at geba; ramah is afraid; gibeah of saul is
fled

10:30 lift up thi voic o daughter of gallim: caus it to be heard
unto laish o poor anathoth

10:31 madmenah is removed; the inhabit of gebim gather themselv
to flee

10:32 as yet shall he remain at nob that day: he shall shake hi hand
against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem

10:33 behold the lord the lord of host shall lop the bough with
terror: and the high one of statur shall be hewn down and the
haughti shall be humbl

10:34 and he shall cut down the thicket of the forest with iron and
lebanon shall fall by a mighti one

11:1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jess and a
branch shall grow out of hi roots: 11:2 and the spirit of the lord
shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understand the
spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledg and of the fear
of the lord; 11:3 and shall make him of quick understand in the
fear of the lord: and he shall not judg after the sight of hi eye
neither reprov after the hear of hi ears: 11:4 but with
righteous shall he judg the poor and reprov with equiti for the
meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of hi
mouth and with the breath of hi lip shall he slay the wick

11:5 and righteous shall be the girdl of hi loin and
faith the girdl of hi rein

11:6 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall

11:7 and the cow and the bear shall feed; their young one shall lie

11:8 and the suck child shall play on the hole of the asp and the
wean child shall put hi hand on the cockatric den

11:9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holi mountain: for the
earth shall be full of the knowledg of the lord as the water cover

11:10 and in that day there shall be a root of jess which shall
stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the gentil seek: and

11:11 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set

judah from the four corner of the earth

11:13 the envi also of ephraim shall depart and the adversari of

11:14 but they shall fli upon the shoulder of the philistin toward
the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay
their hand upon edom and moab; and the children of ammon shall obey
them

11:15 and the lord shall utterli destroy the tongu of the egyptian
sea; and with hi mighti wind shall he shake hi hand over the river
and shall smite it in the seven stream and make men go over dryshod

11:16 and there shall be an highway for the remnant of hi peopl
which shall be left from assyria; like as it wa to israel in the day
that he came up out of the land of egypt

12:1 and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will prais thee:

comfortedst me

12:2 behold god is my salvation; i will trust and not be afraid: for

13:1 the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see

13:2 lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voic unto
them shake the hand that they may go into the gate of the nobl

13:3 i have command my sanctifi one i have also call my mighti
one for mine anger even them that rejoic in my high

13:4 the nois of a multitud in the mountain like as of a great
people; a tumultu nois of the kingdom of nation gather

13:5 they come from a far countri from the end of heaven even the
lord and the weapon of hi indign to destroy the whole land

13:6 howl ye; for the day of the lord is at hand; it shall come as a
destruct from the almighti

13:7 therefor shall all hand be faint and everi man heart shall

of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall
be amaz one at another; their face shall be as flame

13:9 behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and
fierc anger to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the
sinner thereof out of it

13:10 for the star of heaven and the constel thereof shall not
give their light: the sun shall be darken in hi go forth and
the moon shall not caus her light to shine

13:11 and i will punish the world for their evil and the wick for
their iniquity; and i will caus the arrog of the proud to ceas
and will lay low the haughti of the terribl

13:12 i will make a man more preciou than fine gold; even a man than

13:13 therefor i will shake the heaven and the earth shall remov
out of her place in the wrath of the lord of host and in the day of
hi fierc anger

13:14 and it shall be as the chase roe and as a sheep that no man
taketh up: they shall everi man turn to hi own peopl and flee everi
one into hi own land

13:15 everi one that is found shall be thrust through; and everi one
that is join unto them shall fall by the sword

13:16 their children also shall be dash to piec befor their eyes;
their hous shall be spoil and their wive ravish

13:17 behold i will stir up the mede against them which shall not
regard silver; and as for gold they shall not delight in it

13:18 their bow also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
shall have no piti on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not

13:19 and babylon the glori of kingdom the beauti of the chalde
excel shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah

13:20 it shall never be inhabit neither shall it be dwelt in from
gener to generation: neither shall the arabian pitch tent there;
neither shall the shepherd make their fold there

13:21 but wild beast of the desert shall lie there; and their hous
shall be full of dole creatures; and owl shall dwell there and
satyr shall danc there

13:22 and the wild beast of the island shall cri in their desol
hous and dragon in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to

14:1 for the lord will have merci on jacob and will yet choos
israel and set them in their own land: and the stranger shall be
join with them and they shall cleav to the hous of jacob

14:2 and the peopl shall take them and bring them to their place:
and the hous of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for
servant and handmaids: and they shall take them captiv whose
captiv they were; and they shall rule over their oppressor

14:3 and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give
thee rest from thi sorrow and from thi fear and from the hard
bondag wherein thou wast made to serv 14:4 that thou shalt take up
thi proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the
oppressor ceased! the golden citi ceased! 14:5 the lord hath broken
the staff of the wick and the sceptr of the ruler

14:6 he who smote the peopl in wrath with a continu stroke he that
rule the nation in anger is persecut and none hindereth

14:7 the whole earth is at rest and is quiet: they break forth into
sing

14:8 yea the fir tree rejoic at thee and the cedar of lebanon
say sinc thou art laid down no feller is come up against us

14:9 hell from beneath is move for thee to meet thee at thi coming:
it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief one of the
earth; it hath rais up from their throne all the king of the
nation

14:10 all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also becom
weak as we? art thou becom like unto us? 14:11 thi pomp is brought
down to the grave and the nois of thi viols: the worm is spread
under thee and the worm cover thee

14:12 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucif son of the morning!
how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations!
14:13 for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i
will exalt my throne abov the star of god: i will sit also upon the
mount of the congreg in the side of the north: 14:14 i will
ascend abov the height of the clouds; i will be like the most high

14:15 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the side of the pit

14:16 they that see thee shall narrowli look upon thee and consid
thee say is thi the man that made the earth to trembl that did
shake kingdoms; 14:17 that made the world as a wilder and
destroy the citi thereof; that open not the hous of hi
prisoners? 14:18 all the king of the nation even all of them lie
in glori everi one in hi own hous

14:19 but thou art cast out of thi grave like an abomin branch
and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a
sword that go down to the stone of the pit; as a carcas trodden
under feet

14:20 thou shalt not be join with them in burial becaus thou hast
destroy thi land and slain thi people: the seed of evildo shall
never be renown

14:21 prepar slaughter for hi children for the iniqu of their
fathers; that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the
face of the world with citi

14:22 for i will rise up against them saith the lord of host and
cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith
the lord

14:23 i will also make it a possess for the bittern and pool of
water: and i will sweep it with the besom of destruct saith the
lord of host

14:24 the lord of host hath sworn say sure as i have thought
so shall it come to pass; and as i have purpos so shall it stand:
14:25 that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountain
tread him under foot: then shall hi yoke depart from off them and
hi burden depart from off their shoulder

14:26 thi is the purpos that is purpos upon the whole earth: and
thi is the hand that is stretch out upon all the nation

14:27 for the lord of host hath purpos and who shall disannul it?
and hi hand is stretch out and who shall turn it back? 14:28 in
the year that king ahaz die wa thi burden

14:29 rejoic not thou whole palestina becaus the rod of him that
smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent root shall come forth a
cockatric and hi fruit shall be a fieri fli serpent

14:30 and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needi shall
lie down in safety: and i will kill thi root with famin and he shall
slay thi remnant

14:31 howl o gate; cri o city; thou whole palestina art dissolved:
for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alon
in hi appoint time

14:32 what shall one then answer the messeng of the nation? that
the lord hath found zion and the poor of hi peopl shall trust in
it

15:1 the burden of moab becaus in the night ar of moab is laid
wast and brought to silence; becaus in the night kir of moab is
laid wast and brought to silence; 15:2 he is gone up to bajith and
to dibon the high place to weep: moab shall howl over nebo and
over medeba: on all their head shall be bald and everi beard cut
off

15:3 in their street they shall gird themselv with sackcloth: on
the top of their hous and in their street everi one shall howl
weep abundantli

15:4 and heshbon shall cri and elealeh: their voic shall be heard
even unto jahaz: therefor the arm soldier of moab shall cri out;
hi life shall be grievou unto him

15:5 my heart shall cri out for moab; hi fugit shall flee unto
zoar an heifer of three year old: for by the mount up of luhith
with weep shall they go it up; for in the way of horonaim they
shall rais up a cri of destruct

15:6 for the water of nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
wither away the grass faileth there is no green thing

15:7 therefor the abund they have gotten and that which they
have laid up shall they carri away to the brook of the willow

15:8 for the cri is gone round about the border of moab; the howl
thereof unto eglaim and the howl thereof unto beerelim

15:9 for the water of dimon shall be full of blood: for i will bring
more upon dimon lion upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the
remnant of the land

16:1 send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the
wilder unto the mount of the daughter of zion

16:2 for it shall be that as a wander bird cast out of the nest
so the daughter of moab shall be at the ford of arnon

16:3 take counsel execut judgment; make thi shadow as the night in
the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that
wandereth

16:4 let mine outcast dwell with thee moab; be thou a covert to them
from the face of the spoiler: for the extortion is at an end the
spoiler ceaseth the oppressor are consum out of the land

16:5 and in merci shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
upon it in truth in the tabernacl of david judg and seek
judgment and hast righteous

16:6 we have heard of the pride of moab; he is veri proud: even of hi
haughti and hi pride and hi wrath: but hi lie shall not be
so

16:7 therefor shall moab howl for moab everi one shall howl: for the
foundat of kirhareseth shall ye mourn; sure they are stricken

16:8 for the field of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah: the
lord of the heathen have broken down the princip plant thereof
they are come even unto jazer they wander through the wilderness:
her branch are stretch out they are gone over the sea

16:9 therefor i will bewail with the weep of jazer the vine of
sibmah: i will water thee with my tear o heshbon and elealeh: for
the shout for thi summer fruit and for thi harvest is fallen

16:10 and glad is taken away and joy out of the plenti field;
and in the vineyard there shall be no sing neither shall there be
shouting: the treader shall tread out no wine in their presses; i
have made their vintag shout to ceas

16:11 wherefor my bowel shall sound like an harp for moab and mine
inward part for kirharesh

16:12 and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weari on
the high place that he shall come to hi sanctuari to pray; but he
shall not prevail

16:13 thi is the word that the lord hath spoken concern moab sinc
that time

16:14 but now the lord hath spoken say within three year as the
year of an hirel and the glori of moab shall be contemn with
all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be veri small and
feebl

17:1 the burden of damascu behold damascu is taken away from be
a citi and it shall be a ruinou heap

17:2 the citi of aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flock which
shall lie down and none shall make them afraid

17:3 the fortress also shall ceas from ephraim and the kingdom from
damascu and the remnant of syria: they shall be as the glori of the
children of israel saith the lord of host

17:4 and in that day it shall come to pass that the glori of jacob
shall be made thin and the fat of hi flesh shall wax lean

17:5 and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and
reapeth the ear with hi arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth
ear in the valley of rephaim

17:6 yet glean grape shall be left in it as the shake of an
oliv tree two or three berri in the top of the uppermost bough
four or five in the outmost fruit branch thereof saith the lord
god of israel

17:7 at that day shall a man look to hi maker and hi eye shall
have respect to the holi one of israel

17:8 and he shall not look to the altar the work of hi hand
neither shall respect that which hi finger have made either the
grove or the imag

17:9 in that day shall hi strong citi be as a forsaken bough and
an uppermost branch which they left becaus of the children of
israel: and there shall be desol

17:10 becaus thou hast forgotten the god of thi salvat and hast
not been mind of the rock of thi strength therefor shalt thou
plant pleasant plant and shalt set it with strang slips: 17:11 in
the day shalt thou make thi plant to grow and in the morn shalt
thou make thi seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the
day of grief and of desper sorrow

17:12 woe to the multitud of mani peopl which make a nois like the
nois of the seas; and to the rush of nation that make a rush
like the rush of mighti waters! 17:13 the nation shall rush like
the rush of mani waters: but god shall rebuk them and they shall
flee far off and shall be chase as the chaff of the mountain befor
the wind and like a roll thing befor the whirlwind

17:14 and behold at eveningtid trouble; and befor the morn he is
not

hitherto; a nation mete out and trodden down whose land the river
have spoiled! 18:3 all ye inhabit of the world and dweller on
the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye

18:4 for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will
consid in my dwell place like a clear heat upon herb and like a
cloud of dew in the heat of harvest

18:5 for afor the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour
grape is ripen in the flower he shall both cut off the sprig with
prune hook and take away and cut down the branch

18:6 they shall be left togeth unto the fowl of the mountain and
to the beast of the earth: and the fowl shall summer upon them and
all the beast of the earth shall winter upon them

18:7 in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of host

whose land the river have spoil to the place of the name of the

neighbour; citi against citi and kingdom against kingdom

19:3 and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and i
will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idol
and to the charmer and to them that have familiar spirit and to
the wizard

19:4 and the egyptian will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
and a fierc king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of

host which he shaketh over it

19:17 and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt everi one
that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself becaus of the
counsel of the lord of host which he hath determin against it

19:18 in that day shall five citi in the land of egypt speak the
languag of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts; one shall be

19:19 in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of
the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord

19:20 and it shall be for a sign and for a wit unto the lord of
host in the land of egypt: for they shall cri unto the lord becaus

and the residu of the number of archer the mighti men of the
children of kedar shall be diminished: for the lord god of israel

thi robe and strengthen him with thi girdl and i will commit thi
govern into hi hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabit
of jerusalem and to the hous of judah

22:22 and the key of the hous of david will i lay upon hi shoulder;
so he shall open and none shall shut; and he shall shut and none

22:23 and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be
for a gloriou throne to hi father hous

22:24 and they shall hang upon him all the glori of hi father
hous the offspr and the issu all vessel of small quantiti
from the vessel of cup even to all the vessel of flagon

22:25 in that day saith the lord of host shall the nail that is
fasten in the sure place be remov and be cut down and fall; and
the burden that wa upon it shall be cut off: for the lord hath spoken
it

23:1 the burden of tyre howl ye ship of tarshish; for it is laid
wast so that there is no hous no enter in: from the land of
chittim it is reveal to them

23:2 be still ye inhabit of the isle; thou whom the merchant of
zidon that pass over the sea have replenish

23:3 and by great water the seed of sihor the harvest of the river
is her revenue; and she is a mart of nation

23:4 be thou asham o zidon: for the sea hath spoken even the
strength of the sea say i travail not nor bring forth children
neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgin

23:5 as at the report concern egypt so shall they be sore pain
at the report of tyre

23:6 pass ye over to tarshish; howl ye inhabit of the isl

23:7 is thi your joyou citi whose antiqu is of ancient days? her
own feet shall carri her afar off to sojourn

23:8 who hath taken thi counsel against tyre the crown citi
whose merchant are princ whose traffick are the honour of
the earth? 23:9 the lord of host hath purpos it to stain the
pride of all glori and to bring into contempt all the honour of
the earth

23:10 pass through thi land as a river o daughter of tarshish: there
is no more strength

23:11 he stretch out hi hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms:
the lord hath given a command against the merchant citi to
destroy the strong hold thereof

23:12 and he said thou shalt no more rejoic o thou oppress
virgin daughter of zidon: aris pass over to chittim; there also
shalt thou have no rest

23:13 behold the land of the chaldeans; thi peopl wa not till the
assyrian found it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up
the tower thereof they rais up the palac thereof; and he brought
it to ruin

23:14 howl ye ship of tarshish: for your strength is laid wast

23:15 and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be
forgotten seventi year accord to the day of one king: after the
end of seventi year shall tyre sing as an harlot

23:16 take an harp go about the citi thou harlot that hast been
forgotten; make sweet melodi sing mani song that thou mayest be
rememb

23:17 and it shall come to pass after the end of seventi year that
the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall
commit fornic with all the kingdom of the world upon the face of
the earth

23:18 and her merchandis and her hire shall be holi to the lord:
it shall not be treasur nor laid up; for her merchandis shall be
for them that dwell befor the lord to eat suffici and for
durabl cloth

24:1 behold the lord maketh the earth empti and maketh it wast and
turneth it upsid down and scattereth abroad the inhabit thereof

24:2 and it shall be as with the peopl so with the priest; as with
the servant so with hi master; as with the maid so with her
mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller; as with the lender
so with the borrower; as with the taker of usuri so with the giver of
usuri to him

24:3 the land shall be utterli empti and utterli spoiled: for the
lord hath spoken thi word

24:4 the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and
fadeth away the haughti peopl of the earth do languish

24:5 the earth also is defil under the inhabit thereof; becaus
they have transgress the law chang the ordin broken the
everlast coven

24:6 therefor hath the curs devour the earth and they that dwell
therein are desolate: therefor the inhabit of the earth are
burn and few men left

24:7 the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryheart
do sigh

24:8 the mirth of tabret ceaseth the nois of them that rejoic
endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth

24:9 they shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
bitter to them that drink it

24:10 the citi of confus is broken down: everi hous is shut up
that no man may come in

24:11 there is a cri for wine in the streets; all joy is darken
the mirth of the land is gone

24:12 in the citi is left desol and the gate is smitten with
destruct

24:13 when thu it shall be in the midst of the land among the peopl
there shall be as the shake of an oliv tree and as the glean
grape when the vintag is done

24:14 they shall lift up their voic they shall sing for the majesti
of the lord they shall cri aloud from the sea

24:15 wherefor glorifi ye the lord in the fire even the name of the
lord god of israel in the isl of the sea

24:16 from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard song even
glori to the righteou but i said my lean my lean woe unto
me! the treacher dealer have dealt treacherously; yea the
treacher dealer have dealt veri treacher

24:17 fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabit of
the earth

24:18 and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the nois of
the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the
midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the window from on
high are open and the foundat of the earth do shake

24:19 the earth is utterli broken down the earth is clean dissolv
the earth is move exceedingli

24:20 the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be
remov like a cottage; and the transgress thereof shall be heavi
upon it; and it shall fall and not rise again

24:21 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall
punish the host of the high one that are on high and the king of
the earth upon the earth

24:22 and they shall be gather togeth as prison are gather
in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after mani day
shall they be visit

24:23 then the moon shall be confound and the sun asham when the
lord of host shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and befor
hi ancient glorious

25:1 o lord thou art my god; i will exalt thee i will prais thi
name; for thou hast done wonder things; thi counsel of old are
faith and truth

25:2 for thou hast made of a citi an heap; of a defenc citi a ruin:
a palac of stranger to be no city; it shall never be built

25:3 therefor shall the strong peopl glorifi thee the citi of the
terribl nation shall fear thee

25:4 for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the
needi in hi distress a refug from the storm a shadow from the
heat when the blast of the terribl one is as a storm against the
wall

25:5 thou shalt bring down the nois of stranger as the heat in a
dri place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the
terribl one shall be brought low

25:6 and in thi mountain shall the lord of host make unto all peopl
a feast of fat thing a feast of wine on the lee of fat thing
full of marrow of wine on the lee well refin

25:7 and he will destroy in thi mountain the face of the cover
cast over all peopl and the vail that is spread over all nation

25:8 he will swallow up death in victory; and the lord god will wipe
away tear from off all faces; and the rebuk of hi peopl shall he
take away from off all the earth: for the lord hath spoken it

25:9 and it shall be said in that day lo thi is our god; we have
wait for him and he will save us: thi is the lord; we have wait
for him we will be glad and rejoic in hi salvat

25:10 for in thi mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab
shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the
dunghil

25:11 and he shall spread forth hi hand in the midst of them as he
that swimmeth spreadeth forth hi hand to swim: and he shall bring
down their pride togeth with the spoil of their hand

25:12 and the fortress of the high fort of thi wall shall he bring
down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust

26:1 in that day shall thi song be sung in the land of judah; we have
a strong city; salvat will god appoint for wall and bulwark

26:2 open ye the gate that the righteou nation which keepeth the
truth may enter in

26:3 thou wilt keep him in perfect peac whose mind is stay on
thee: becaus he trusteth in thee

26:4 trust ye in the lord for ever: for in the lord jehovah is
everlast strength: 26:5 for he bringeth down them that dwell on
high; the lofti citi he layeth it low; he layeth it low even to the
ground; he bringeth it even to the dust

26:6 the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the
step of the needi

26:7 the way of the just is uprightness: thou most upright dost
weigh the path of the just

26:8 yea in the way of thi judgment o lord have we wait for
thee; the desir of our soul is to thi name and to the remembr of
thee

26:9 with my soul have i desir thee in the night; yea with my
spirit within me will i seek thee early: for when thi judgment are in
the earth the inhabit of the world will learn righteous

26:10 let favour be shew to the wick yet will he not learn
righteousness: in the land of upright will he deal unjustli and
will not behold the majesti of the lord

26:11 lord when thi hand is lift up they will not see: but they
shall see and be asham for their envi at the people; yea the fire
of thine enemi shall devour them

26:12 lord thou wilt ordain peac for us: for thou also hast wrought
all our work in us

26:13 o lord our god other lord besid thee have had dominion over
us: but by thee onli will we make mention of thi name

26:14 they are dead they shall not live; they are deceas they
shall not rise: therefor hast thou visit and destroy them and
made all their memori to perish

26:15 thou hast increas the nation o lord thou hast increas the
nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst remov it far unto all the
end of the earth

26:16 lord in troubl have they visit thee they pour out a
prayer when thi chasten wa upon them

26:17 like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her
deliveri is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in
thi sight o lord

26:18 we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it
were brought forth wind; we have not wrought ani deliver in the
earth; neither have the inhabit of the world fallen

26:19 thi dead men shall live togeth with my dead bodi shall they
aris awak and sing ye that dwell in dust: for thi dew is as the
dew of herb and the earth shall cast out the dead

26:20 come my peopl enter thou into thi chamber and shut thi
door about thee: hide thyself as it were for a littl moment until
the indign be overpast

26:21 for behold the lord cometh out of hi place to punish the
inhabit of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall
disclos her blood and shall no more cover her slain

27:1 in that day the lord with hi sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the pierc serpent even leviathan that
crook serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea

27:2 in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine

27:3 i the lord do keep it; i will water it everi moment: lest ani
hurt it i will keep it night and day

27:4 furi is not in me: who would set the brier and thorn against me
in battle? i would go through them i would burn them togeth

27:5 or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peac with
me; and he shall make peac with me

27:6 he shall caus them that come of jacob to take root: israel shall
blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit

27:7 hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him? or is he
slain accord to the slaughter of them that are slain by him? 27:8
in measur when it shooteth forth thou wilt debat with it: he
stayeth hi rough wind in the day of the east wind

27:9 by thi therefor shall the iniqu of jacob be purged; and thi
is all the fruit to take away hi sin; when he maketh all the stone
of the altar as chalkston that are beaten in sunder the grove and
imag shall not stand up

27:10 yet the defenc citi shall be desol and the habit
forsaken and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed and
there shall he lie down and consum the branch thereof

27:11 when the bough thereof are wither they shall be broken off:
the women come and set them on fire: for it is a peopl of no
understanding: therefor he that made them will not have merci on
them and he that form them will shew them no favour

27:12 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat
off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye
shall be gather one by one o ye children of israel

27:13 and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet
shall be blown and they shall come which were readi to perish in the
land of assyria and the outcast in the land of egypt and shall
worship the lord in the holi mount at jerusalem

28:1 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkard of ephraim whose
gloriou beauti is a fade flower which are on the head of the fat
valley of them that are overcom with wine! 28:2 behold the lord
hath a mighti and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a
destroy storm as a flood of mighti water overflow shall cast
down to the earth with the hand

28:3 the crown of pride the drunkard of ephraim shall be trodden
under feet: 28:4 and the gloriou beauti which is on the head of the
fat valley shall be a fade flower and as the hasti fruit befor
the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet
in hi hand he eateth it up

28:5 in that day shall the lord of host be for a crown of glori and
for a diadem of beauti unto the residu of hi peopl 28:6 and for a
spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength
to them that turn the battl to the gate

28:7 but they also have er through wine and through strong drink
are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have er through
strong drink they are swallow up of wine they are out of the way
through strong drink; they err in vision they stumbl in judgment

28:8 for all tabl are full of vomit and filthi so that there is
no place clean

28:9 whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine? them that are wean from the milk and drawn
from the breast

28:10 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept; line
upon line line upon line; here a littl and there a little: 28:11
for with stammer lip and anoth tongu will he speak to thi
peopl

28:12 to whom he said thi is the rest wherewith ye may caus the
weari to rest; and thi is the refreshing: yet they would not hear

28:13 but the word of the lord wa unto them precept upon precept
precept upon precept; line upon line line upon line; here a littl
and there a little; that they might go and fall backward and be
broken and snare and taken

28:14 wherefor hear the word of the lord ye scorn men that rule
thi peopl which is in jerusalem

28:15 becaus ye have said we have made a coven with death and
with hell are we at agreement; when the overflow scourg shall pass
through it shall not come unto us: for we have made lie our refug
and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: 28:16 therefor thu saith
the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundat a stone a tri
stone a preciou corner stone a sure foundation: he that believeth
shall not make hast

28:17 judgment also will i lay to the line and righteous to the
plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refug of lie and the
water shall overflow the hide place

28:18 and your coven with death shall be disannul and your
agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflow scourg
shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it

28:19 from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morn
by morn shall it pass over by day and by night: and it shall be a
vexat onli to understand the report

28:20 for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
it: and the cover narrow than that he can wrap himself in it

28:21 for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be
wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do hi work hi strang
work; and bring to pass hi act hi strang act

28:22 now therefor be ye not mocker lest your band be made strong:
for i have heard from the lord god of host a consumpt even
determin upon the whole earth

28:23 give ye ear and hear my voice; hearken and hear my speech

28:24 doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
clod of hi ground? 28:25 when he hath made plain the face thereof
doth he not cast abroad the fitch and scatter the cummin and cast
in the princip wheat and the appoint barley and the rie in their
place? 28:26 for hi god doth instruct him to discret and doth
teach him

28:27 for the fitch are not thresh with a thresh instrument
neither is a cart wheel turn about upon the cummin; but the fitch
are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod

28:28 bread corn is bruised; becaus he will not ever be thresh it
nor break it with the wheel of hi cart nor bruis it with hi
horsemen

28:29 thi also cometh forth from the lord of host which is
wonder in counsel and excel in work

29:1 woe to ariel to ariel the citi where david dwelt! add ye year
to year; let them kill sacrific

29:2 yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heavi and
sorrow: and it shall be unto me as ariel

29:3 and i will camp against thee round about and will lay sieg
against thee with a mount and i will rais fort against thee

29:4 and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the
ground and thi speech shall be low out of the dust and thi voic
shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground
and thi speech shall whisper out of the dust

29:5 moreov the multitud of thi stranger shall be like small dust
and the multitud of the terribl one shall be as chaff that passeth
away: yea it shall be at an instant suddenli

29:6 thou shalt be visit of the lord of host with thunder and with
earthquak and great nois with storm and tempest and the flame of
devour fire

29:7 and the multitud of all the nation that fight against ariel
even all that fight against her and her munit and that distress
her shall be as a dream of a night vision

29:8 it shall even be as when an hungri man dreameth and behold he
eateth; but he awaketh and hi soul is empty: or as when a thirsti
man dreameth and behold he drinketh; but he awaketh and behold
he is faint and hi soul hath appetite: so shall the multitud of all
the nation be that fight against mount zion

29:9 stay yourselv and wonder; cri ye out and cry: they are
drunken but not with wine; they stagger but not with strong drink

29:10 for the lord hath pour out upon you the spirit of deep sleep
and hath close your eyes: the prophet and your ruler the seer
hath he cover

29:11 and the vision of all is becom unto you as the word of a book
that is seal which men deliv to one that is learn say read
thi i pray thee: and he saith i cannot; for it is sealed: 29:12 and
the book is deliv to him that is not learn say read thi i
pray thee: and he saith i am not learn

29:13 wherefor the lord said forasmuch as thi peopl draw near me
with their mouth and with their lip do honour me but have remov
their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the
precept of men: 29:14 therefor behold i will proceed to do a
marvel work among thi peopl even a marvel work and a
wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the
understand of their prudent men shall be hid

29:15 woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
lord and their work are in the dark and they say who seeth us? and
who knoweth us? 29:16 sure your turn of thing upsid down shall
be esteem as the potter clay: for shall the work say of him that
made it he made me not? or shall the thing frame say of him that
frame it he had no understanding? 29:17 is it not yet a veri littl
while and lebanon shall be turn into a fruit field and the
fruit field shall be esteem as a forest? 29:18 and in that day
shall the deaf hear the word of the book and the eye of the blind
shall see out of obscur and out of dark

29:19 the meek also shall increas their joy in the lord and the poor
among men shall rejoic in the holi one of israel

29:20 for the terribl one is brought to nought and the scorner is
consum and all that watch for iniqu are cut off: 29:21 that make
a man an offend for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth
in the gate and turn asid the just for a thing of nought

29:22 therefor thu saith the lord who redeem abraham concern
the hous of jacob jacob shall not now be asham neither shall hi
face now wax pale

29:23 but when he seeth hi children the work of mine hand in the
midst of him they shall sanctifi my name and sanctifi the holi one
of jacob and shall fear the god of israel

29:24 they also that er in spirit shall come to understand and
they that murmur shall learn doctrin

30:1 woe to the rebelli children saith the lord that take
counsel but not of me; and that cover with a cover but not of my
spirit that they may add sin to sin: 30:2 that walk to go down into
egypt and have not ask at my mouth; to strengthen themselv in the
strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt! 30:3
therefor shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust
in the shadow of egypt your confus

30:4 for hi princ were at zoan and hi ambassador came to hane

30:5 they were all asham of a peopl that could not profit them nor
be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach

30:6 the burden of the beast of the south: into the land of troubl
and anguish from whenc come the young and old lion the viper and
fieri fli serpent they will carri their rich upon the shoulder
of young ass and their treasur upon the bunch of camel to a
peopl that shall not profit them

30:7 for the egyptian shall help in vain and to no purpose:
therefor have i cri concern thi their strength is to sit
still

30:8 now go write it befor them in a tabl and note it in a book
that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 30:9 that thi
is a rebelli peopl lie children children that will not hear
the law of the lord: 30:10 which say to the seer see not; and to the
prophet prophesi not unto us right thing speak unto us smooth
thing prophesi deceits: 30:11 get you out of the way turn asid out
of the path caus the holi one of israel to ceas from befor us

30:12 wherefor thu saith the holi one of israel becaus ye despis
thi word and trust in oppress and pervers and stay thereon:
30:13 therefor thi iniqu shall be to you as a breach readi to
fall swell out in a high wall whose break cometh suddenli at
an instant

30:14 and he shall break it as the break of the potter vessel
that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not
be found in the burst of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth
or to take water withal out of the pit

30:15 for thu saith the lord god the holi one of israel; in
return and rest shall ye be saved; in quiet and in confid
shall be your strength: and ye would not

30:16 but ye said no; for we will flee upon horses; therefor shall
ye flee: and we will ride upon the swift; therefor shall they that
pursu you be swift

30:17 one thousand shall flee at the rebuk of one; at the rebuk of
five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a
mountain and as an ensign on an hill

30:18 and therefor will the lord wait that he may be graciou unto
you and therefor will he be exalt that he may have merci upon
you: for the lord is a god of judgment: bless are all they that wait
for him

30:19 for the peopl shall dwell in zion at jerusalem: thou shalt weep
no more: he will be veri graciou unto thee at the voic of thi cry;
when he shall hear it he will answer thee

30:20 and though the lord give you the bread of advers and the
water of afflict yet shall not thi teacher be remov into a
corner ani more but thine eye shall see thi teachers: 30:21 and
thine ear shall hear a word behind thee say thi is the way
walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the
left

30:22 ye shall defil also the cover of thi graven imag of
silver and the ornament of thi molten imag of gold: thou shalt cast
them away as a menstruou cloth; thou shalt say unto it get thee
henc

30:23 then shall he give the rain of thi seed that thou shalt sow the
ground withal; and bread of the increas of the earth and it shall be
fat and plenteous: in that day shall thi cattl feed in larg
pastur

30:24 the oxen likewis and the young ass that ear the ground shall
eat clean provend which hath been winnow with the shovel and with
the fan

30:25 and there shall be upon everi high mountain and upon everi high
hill river and stream of water in the day of the great slaughter
when the tower fall

30:26 moreov the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven
day in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of hi peopl
and healeth the stroke of their wound

30:27 behold the name of the lord cometh from far burn with hi
anger and the burden thereof is heavy: hi lip are full of
indign and hi tongu as a devour fire: 30:28 and hi breath
as an overflow stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to
sift the nation with the siev of vanity: and there shall be a bridl
in the jaw of the peopl caus them to err

30:29 ye shall have a song as in the night when a holi solemn is
kept; and glad of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come
into the mountain of the lord to the mighti one of israel

30:30 and the lord shall caus hi gloriou voic to be heard and
shall shew the light down of hi arm with the indign of hi
anger and with the flame of a devour fire with scatter and
tempest and hailston

30:31 for through the voic of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten
down which smote with a rod

30:32 and in everi place where the ground staff shall pass which
the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabret and harps: and
in battl of shake will he fight with it

30:33 for tophet is ordain of old; yea for the king it is prepared;
he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much
wood; the breath of the lord like a stream of brimston doth kindl
it

31:1 woe to them that go down to egypt for help; and stay on hors
and trust in chariot becaus they are many; and in horsemen becaus
they are veri strong; but they look not unto the holi one of israel
neither seek the lord! 31:2 yet he also is wise and will bring evil
and will not call back hi words: but will aris against the hous of
the evildo and against the help of them that work iniqu

31:3 now the egyptian are men and not god; and their hors flesh
and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out hi hand both he that
helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they
all shall fail togeth

31:4 for thu hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the
young lion roar on hi prey when a multitud of shepherd is
call forth against him he will not be afraid of their voic nor
abas himself for the nois of them: so shall the lord of host come
down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof

31:5 as bird fli so will the lord of host defend jerusalem;
defend also he will deliv it; and pass over he will preserv
it

31:6 turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deepli
revolt

31:7 for in that day everi man shall cast away hi idol of silver
and hi idol of gold which your own hand have made unto you for a
sin

31:8 then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighti man;
and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him: but he shall flee
from the sword and hi young men shall be discomfit

31:9 and he shall pass over to hi strong hold for fear and hi
princ shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is
in zion and hi furnac in jerusalem

32:1 behold a king shall reign in righteous and princ shall
rule in judgment

32:2 and a man shall be as an hide place from the wind and a covert
from the tempest; as river of water in a dri place as the shadow of
a great rock in a weari land

32:3 and the eye of them that see shall not be dim and the ear of
them that hear shall hearken

32:4 the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledg and the
tongu of the stammer shall be readi to speak plainli

32:5 the vile person shall be no more call liber nor the churl
said to be bounti

32:6 for the vile person will speak villani and hi heart will work
iniqu to practis hypocrisi and to utter error against the lord
to make empti the soul of the hungri and he will caus the drink of
the thirsti to fail

32:7 the instrument also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wick
devic to destroy the poor with lie word even when the needi
speaketh right

32:8 but the liber deviseth liber things; and by liber thing
shall he stand

32:9 rise up ye women that are at ease; hear my voic ye careless
daughters; give ear unto my speech

32:10 mani day and year shall ye be troubl ye careless women: for
the vintag shall fail the gather shall not come

32:11 trembl ye women that are at ease; be troubl ye careless
ones: strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your
loin

32:12 they shall lament for the teat for the pleasant field for
the fruit vine

32:13 upon the land of my peopl shall come up thorn and briers; yea
upon all the hous of joy in the joyou city: 32:14 becaus the
palac shall be forsaken; the multitud of the citi shall be left;
the fort and tower shall be for den for ever a joy of wild ass
a pastur of flocks; 32:15 until the spirit be pour upon us from on
high and the wilder be a fruit field and the fruit field
be count for a forest

32:16 then judgment shall dwell in the wilder and righteous
remain in the fruit field

32:17 and the work of righteous shall be peace; and the effect of
righteous quiet and assur for ever

32:18 and my peopl shall dwell in a peaceabl habit and in sure
dwell and in quiet rest places; 32:19 when it shall hail
come down on the forest; and the citi shall be low in a low place

32:20 bless are ye that sow besid all water that send forth
thither the feet of the ox and the ass

33:1 woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
treacher and they dealt not treacher with thee! when thou
shalt ceas to spoil thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make
an end to deal treacher they shall deal treacher with thee

33:2 o lord be graciou unto us; we have wait for thee: be thou
their arm everi morn our salvat also in the time of troubl

33:3 at the nois of the tumult the peopl fled; at the lift up of
thyself the nation were scatter

33:4 and your spoil shall be gather like the gather of the
caterpiller: as the run to and fro of locust shall he run upon
them

33:5 the lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath fill zion
with judgment and righteous

33:6 and wisdom and knowledg shall be the stabil of thi time and
strength of salvation: the fear of the lord is hi treasur

33:7 behold their valiant one shall cri without: the ambassador of
peac shall weep bitterli

33:8 the highway lie wast the wayfar man ceaseth: he hath broken
the coven he hath despis the citi he regardeth no man

33:9 the earth mourneth and languisheth: lebanon is asham and hewn
down: sharon is like a wilderness; and bashan and carmel shake off
their fruit

33:10 now will i rise saith the lord; now will i be exalted; now will
i lift up myself

33:11 ye shall conceiv chaff ye shall bring forth stubble: your
breath as fire shall devour you

33:12 and the peopl shall be as the burn of lime: as thorn cut
up shall they be burn in the fire

33:13 hear ye that are far off what i have done; and ye that are
near acknowledg my might

33:14 the sinner in zion are afraid; fear hath surpris the
hypocrit who among us shall dwell with the devour fire? who
among us shall dwell with everlast burnings? 33:15 he that walketh
righteous and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of
oppress that shaketh hi hand from hold of bribe that
stoppeth hi ear from hear of blood and shutteth hi eye from
see evil; 33:16 he shall dwell on high: hi place of defenc shall
be the munit of rocks: bread shall be given him; hi water shall
be sure

33:17 thine eye shall see the king in hi beauty: they shall behold
the land that is veri far off

33:18 thine heart shall medit terror where is the scribe? where is
the receiver? where is he that count the towers? 33:19 thou shalt
not see a fierc peopl a peopl of a deeper speech than thou canst
perceive; of a stammer tongu that thou canst not understand

33:20 look upon zion the citi of our solemnities: thine eye shall
see jerusalem a quiet habit a tabernacl that shall not be taken
down; not one of the stake thereof shall ever be remov neither
shall ani of the cord thereof be broken

33:21 but there the gloriou lord will be unto us a place of broad
river and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oar neither
shall gallant ship pass therebi

33:22 for the lord is our judg the lord is our lawgiv the lord is
our king; he will save us

33:23 thi tackl are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
mast they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great
spoil divided; the lame take the prey

33:24 and the inhabit shall not say i am sick: the peopl that
dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniqu

34:1 come near ye nation to hear; and hearken ye people: let the
earth hear and all that is therein; the world and all thing that
come forth of it

34:2 for the indign of the lord is upon all nation and hi furi
upon all their armies: he hath utterli destroy them he hath
deliv them to the slaughter

34:3 their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up
out of their carcas and the mountain shall be melt with their
blood

34:4 and all the host of heaven shall be dissolv and the heaven
shall be roll togeth as a scroll: and all their host shall fall
down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a fall fig from
the fig tree

34:5 for my sword shall be bath in heaven: behold it shall come
down upon idumea and upon the peopl of my curs to judgment

34:6 the sword of the lord is fill with blood it is made fat with
fat and with the blood of lamb and goat with the fat of the
kidney of rams: for the lord hath a sacrific in bozrah and a great
slaughter in the land of idumea

34:7 and the unicorn shall come down with them and the bullock with
the bulls; and their land shall be soak with blood and their dust
made fat with fat

34:8 for it is the day of the lord vengeanc and the year of
recomp for the controversi of zion

34:9 and the stream thereof shall be turn into pitch and the dust
thereof into brimston and the land thereof shall becom burn
pitch

34:10 it shall not be quench night nor day; the smoke thereof shall
go up for ever: from gener to gener it shall lie waste; none
shall pass through it for ever and ever

34:11 but the cormor and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also
and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the
line of confus and the stone of empti

34:12 they shall call the nobl thereof to the kingdom but none
shall be there and all her princ shall be noth

34:13 and thorn shall come up in her palac nettl and brambl in
the fortress thereof: and it shall be an habit of dragon and
a court for owl

34:14 the wild beast of the desert shall also meet with the wild
beast of the island and the satyr shall cri to hi fellow; the
screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of
rest

34:15 there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and
gather under her shadow: there shall the vultur also be gather
everi one with her mate

34:16 seek ye out of the book of the lord and read: no one of these
shall fail none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath command
and hi spirit it hath gather them

34:17 and he hath cast the lot for them and hi hand hath divid it
unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever from gener to
gener shall they dwell therein

35:1 the wilder and the solitari place shall be glad for them; and
the desert shall rejoic and blossom as the rose

35:2 it shall blossom abundantli and rejoic even with joy and
singing: the glori of lebanon shall be given unto it the excel
of carmel and sharon they shall see the glori of the lord and the
excel of our god

35:3 strengthen ye the weak hand and confirm the feebl knee

35:4 say to them that are of a fear heart be strong fear not:
behold your god will come with vengeanc even god with a recompence;
he will come and save you

35:5 then the eye of the blind shall be open and the ear of the
deaf shall be unstop

35:6 then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongu of the
dumb sing: for in the wilder shall water break out and stream
in the desert

35:7 and the parch ground shall becom a pool and the thirsti land
spring of water: in the habit of dragon where each lay shall
be grass with reed and rush

35:8 and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be call
the way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall
be for those: the wayfar men though fool shall not err therein

35:9 no lion shall be there nor ani raven beast shall go up
thereon it shall not be found there; but the redeem shall walk
there: 35:10 and the ransom of the lord shall return and come to
zion with song and everlast joy upon their heads: they shall
obtain joy and glad and sorrow and sigh shall flee away

36:1 now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that
sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenc citi of
judah and took them

36:2 and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem
unto king hezekiah with a great armi and he stood by the conduit of
the upper pool in the highway of the fuller field

36:3 then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiah son which wa over
the hous and shebna the scribe and joah asaph son the record

36:4 and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thu saith
the great king the king of assyria what confid is thi wherein
thou trustest? 36:5 i say sayest thou (but they are but vain words)
i have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust that
thou rebellest against me? 36:6 lo thou trustest in the staff of
thi broken reed on egypt; whereon if a man lean it will go into hi
hand and pierc it: so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in
him

36:7 but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god: is it not
he whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away and
said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship befor thi altar?
36:8 now therefor give pledg i pray thee to my master the king of
assyria and i will give thee two thousand hors if thou be abl on
thi part to set rider upon them

36:9 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
of my master servant and put thi trust on egypt for chariot and
for horsemen? 36:10 and am i now come up without the lord against
thi land to destroy it? the lord said unto me go up against thi
land and destroy it

36:11 then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i
pray thee unto thi servant in the syrian language; for we understand
it: and speak not to us in the jew languag in the ear of the
peopl that are on the wall

36:12 but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thi master and to
thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit
upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own
piss with you? 36:13 then rabshakeh stood and cri with a loud
voic in the jew languag and said hear ye the word of the great
king the king of assyria

36:14 thu saith the king let not hezekiah deceiv you: for he shall
not be abl to deliv you

36:15 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord say the
lord will sure deliv us: thi citi shall not be deliv into the
hand of the king of assyria

36:16 hearken not to hezekiah: for thu saith the king of assyria
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me: and eat ye
everi one of hi vine and everi one of hi fig tree and drink ye
everi one the water of hi own cistern; 36:17 until i come and take
you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land
of bread and vineyard

36:18 bewar lest hezekiah persuad you say the lord will deliv
us

hath ani of the god of the nation deliv hi land out of the hand
of the king of assyria? 36:19 where are the god of hamath and
arphad? where are the god of sepharvaim? and have they deliv
samaria out of my hand? 36:20 who are they among all the god of
these land that have deliv their land out of my hand that the
lord should deliv jerusalem out of my hand? 36:21 but they held
their peac and answer him not a word: for the king command
wa say answer him not

36:22 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that wa over the
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the
record to hezekiah with their cloth rent and told him the word
of rabshakeh

37:1 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent
hi cloth and cover himself with sackcloth and went into the
hous of the lord

37:2 and he sent eliakim who wa over the household and shebna the
scribe and the elder of the priest cover with sackcloth unto
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz

37:3 and they said unto him thu saith hezekiah thi day is a day of
troubl and of rebuk and of blasphemy: for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth

37:4 it may be the lord thi god will hear the word of rabshakeh whom
the king of assyria hi master hath sent to reproach the live god
and will reprov the word which the lord thi god hath heard:
wherefor lift up thi prayer for the remnant that is left

37:5 so the servant of king hezekiah came to isaiah

37:6 and isaiah said unto them thu shall ye say unto your master
thu saith the lord be not afraid of the word that thou hast heard
wherewith the servant of the king of assyria have blasphem me

37:7 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and return to hi own land; and i will caus him to fall by the sword
in hi own land

37:8 so rabshakeh return and found the king of assyria war
against libnah: for he had heard that he wa depart from lachish

37:9 and he heard say concern tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come
forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messeng
to hezekiah say 37:10 thu shall ye speak to hezekiah king of
judah say let not thi god in whom thou trustest deceiv thee
say jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
assyria

37:11 behold thou hast heard what the king of assyria have done to
all land by destroy them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
37:12 have the god of the nation deliv them which my father
have destroy as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of
eden which were in telassar? 37:13 where is the king of hamath and
the king of arphad and the king of the citi of sepharvaim hena and
ivah? 37:14 and hezekiah receiv the letter from the hand of the
messeng and read it: and hezekiah went up unto the hous of the
lord and spread it befor the lord

37:15 and hezekiah pray unto the lord say 37:16 o lord of
host god of israel that dwellest between the cherubim thou art
the god even thou alon of all the kingdom of the earth: thou hast
made heaven and earth

37:17 inclin thine ear o lord and hear; open thine eye o lord
and see: and hear all the word of sennacherib which hath sent to
reproach the live god

37:18 of a truth lord the king of assyria have laid wast all the
nation and their countri 37:19 and have cast their god into the
fire: for they were no god but the work of men hand wood and
stone: therefor they have destroy them

37:20 now therefor o lord our god save us from hi hand that all
the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou
onli

37:21 then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah say thu
saith the lord god of israel wherea thou hast pray to me against
sennacherib king of assyria: 37:22 thi is the word which the lord
hath spoken concern him; the virgin the daughter of zion hath
despis thee and laugh thee to scorn; the daughter of jerusalem
hath shaken her head at thee

37:23 whom hast thou reproach and blasphemed? and against whom hast
thou exalt thi voic and lift up thine eye on high? even against
the holi one of israel

37:24 by thi servant hast thou reproach the lord and hast said by
the multitud of my chariot am i come up to the height of the
mountain to the side of lebanon; and i will cut down the tall
cedar thereof and the choic fir tree thereof: and i will enter
into the height of hi border and the forest of hi carmel

37:25 i have dig and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
have i dri up all the river of the besieg place

37:26 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it; and of ancient
time that i have form it? now have i brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay wast defenc citi into ruinou heap

37:27 therefor their inhabit were of small power they were
dismay and confounded: they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the housetop and as corn blast
befor it be grown up

37:28 but i know thi abod and thi go out and thi come in and
thi rage against me

37:29 becaus thi rage against me and thi tumult is come up into
mine ear therefor will i put my hook in thi nose and my bridl in
thi lip and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest

37:30 and thi shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat thi year such
as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the
same: and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyard and
eat the fruit thereof

37:31 and the remnant that is escap of the hous of judah shall
again take root downward and bear fruit upward: 37:32 for out of
jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escap out of mount
zion: the zeal of the lord of host shall do thi

37:33 therefor thu saith the lord concern the king of assyria he
shall not come into thi citi nor shoot an arrow there nor come
befor it with shield nor cast a bank against it

37:34 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall
not come into thi citi saith the lord

37:35 for i will defend thi citi to save it for mine own sake and
for my servant david sake

37:36 then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of
the assyrian a hundr and fourscor and five thousand: and when they
aros earli in the morn behold they were all dead corps

37:37 so sennacherib king of assyria depart and went and return
and dwelt at nineveh

37:38 and it came to pass as he wa worship in the hous of
nisroch hi god that adrammelech and sharez hi son smote him with
the sword; and they escap into the land of armenia: and esarhaddon
hi son reign in hi stead

38:1 in those day wa hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the
prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thu saith
the lord set thine hous in order: for thou shalt die and not live

38:2 then hezekiah turn hi face toward the wall and pray unto
the lord 38:3 and said rememb now o lord i beseech thee how i
have walk befor thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have
done that which is good in thi sight and hezekiah wept sore

38:4 then came the word of the lord to isaiah say 38:5 go and
say to hezekiah thu saith the lord the god of david thi father i
have heard thi prayer i have seen thi tears: behold i will add unto
thi day fifteen year

38:6 and i will deliv thee and thi citi out of the hand of the king
of assyria: and i will defend thi citi

38:7 and thi shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord
will do thi thing that he hath spoken; 38:8 behold i will bring
again the shadow of the degre which is gone down in the sun dial of
ahaz ten degre backward so the sun return ten degre by which
degre it wa gone down

38:9 the write of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and
wa recov of hi sickness: 38:10 i said in the cut off of my
day i shall go to the gate of the grave: i am depriv of the
residu of my year

38:11 i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of
the living: i shall behold man no more with the inhabit of the
world

38:12 mine age is depart and is remov from me as a shepherd
tent: i have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with
pine sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me

38:13 i reckon till morn that as a lion so will he break all
my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me

38:14 like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter: i did mourn as a
dove: mine eye fail with look upward: o lord i am oppressed;
undertak for me

38:15 what shall i say? he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath
done it: i shall go softli all my year in the bitter of my soul

38:16 o lord by these thing men live and in all these thing is the
life of my spirit: so wilt thou recov me and make me to live

38:17 behold for peac i had great bitterness: but thou hast in love
to my soul deliv it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast
all my sin behind thi back

38:18 for the grave cannot prais thee death can not celebr thee:
they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thi truth

38:19 the live the live he shall prais thee as i do thi day:
the father to the children shall make known thi truth

38:20 the lord wa readi to save me: therefor we will sing my song
to the string instrument all the day of our life in the hous of
the lord

38:21 for isaiah had said let them take a lump of fig and lay it
for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recov

38:22 hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to
the hous of the lord? 39:1 at that time merodachbaladan the son of
baladan king of babylon sent letter and a present to hezekiah: for
he had heard that he had been sick and wa recov

39:2 and hezekiah wa glad of them and shew them the hous of hi
preciou thing the silver and the gold and the spice and the
preciou ointment and all the hous of hi armour and all that wa
found in hi treasures: there wa noth in hi hous nor in all hi
dominion that hezekiah shew them not

39:3 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto
him what said these men? and from whenc came they unto thee? and
hezekiah said they are come from a far countri unto me even from
babylon

39:4 then said he what have they seen in thine house? and hezekiah
answer all that is in mine hous have they seen: there is noth
among my treasur that i have not shew them

39:5 then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts:
39:6 behold the day come that all that is in thine hous and that
which thi father have laid up in store until thi day shall be
carri to babylon: noth shall be left saith the lord

39:7 and of thi son that shall issu from thee which thou shalt
beget shall they take away; and they shall be eunuch in the palac
of the king of babylon

39:8 then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which
thou hast spoken he said moreov for there shall be peac and truth
in my day

40:1 comfort ye comfort ye my peopl saith your god

40:2 speak ye comfort to jerusalem and cri unto her that her
warfar is accomplish that her iniqu is pardoned: for she hath
receiv of the lord hand doubl for all her sin

40:3 the voic of him that crieth in the wilder prepar ye the
way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god

40:4 everi valley shall be exalt and everi mountain and hill shall
be made low: and the crook shall be made straight and the rough
place plain: 40:5 and the glori of the lord shall be reveal and
all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the lord hath spoken
it

40:6 the voic said cri and he said what shall i cry? all flesh is
grass and all the goodli thereof is as the flower of the field:
40:7 the grass withereth the flower fadeth: becaus the spirit of the
lord bloweth upon it: sure the peopl is grass

40:8 the grass withereth the flower fadeth: but the word of our god
shall stand for ever

40:9 o zion that bringest good tide get thee up into the high
mountain; o jerusalem that bringest good tide lift up thi voic
with strength; lift it up be not afraid; say unto the citi of
judah behold your god! 40:10 behold the lord god will come with
strong hand and hi arm shall rule for him: behold hi reward is
with him and hi work befor him

40:11 he shall feed hi flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
lamb with hi arm and carri them in hi bosom and shall gentli lead
those that are with young

40:12 who hath measur the water in the hollow of hi hand and
mete out heaven with the span and comprehend the dust of the earth
in a measur and weigh the mountain in scale and the hill in a
balance? 40:13 who hath direct the spirit of the lord or be hi
counsellor hath taught him? 40:14 with whom took he counsel and who
instruct him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him
knowledg and shew to him the way of understanding? 40:15 behold
the nation are as a drop of a bucket and are count as the small
dust of the balance: behold he taketh up the isl as a veri littl
thing

40:16 and lebanon is not suffici to burn nor the beast thereof
suffici for a burnt offer

40:17 all nation befor him are as nothing; and they are count to
him less than noth and vaniti

40:18 to whom then will ye liken god? or what like will ye compar
unto him? 40:19 the workman melteth a graven imag and the goldsmith
spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chain

40:20 he that is so impoverish that he hath no oblat chooseth a
tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cun workman to
prepar a graven imag that shall not be move

40:21 have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you
from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundat of the
earth? 40:22 it is he that sitteth upon the circl of the earth and
the inhabit thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
heaven as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
40:23 that bringeth the princ to nothing; he maketh the judg of
the earth as vaniti

40:24 yea they shall not be planted; yea they shall not be sown:
yea their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also
blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take
them away as stubbl

40:25 to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal? saith the
holi one

40:26 lift up your eye on high and behold who hath creat these
thing that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by
name by the great of hi might for that he is strong in power;
not one faileth

40:27 whi sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid
from the lord and my judgment is pass over from my god? 40:28 hast
thou not known? hast thou not heard that the everlast god the
lord the creator of the end of the earth fainteth not neither is
weary? there is no search of hi understand

40:29 he giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength

40:30 even the youth shall faint and be weari and the young men
shall utterli fall: 40:31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew
their strength; they shall mount up with wing as eagles; they shall
run and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint

41:1 keep silenc befor me o islands; and let the peopl renew their
strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near
togeth to judgment

41:2 who rais up the righteou man from the east call him to hi
foot gave the nation befor him and made him rule over kings? he
gave them as the dust to hi sword and as driven stubbl to hi bow

41:3 he pursu them and pass safely; even by the way that he had
not gone with hi feet

41:4 who hath wrought and done it call the gener from the
beginning? i the lord the first and with the last; i am he

41:5 the isl saw it and feared; the end of the earth were afraid
drew near and came

41:6 they help everi one hi neighbour; and everi one said to hi
brother be of good courag

41:7 so the carpent encourag the goldsmith and he that smootheth
with the hammer him that smote the anvil say it is readi for the
sodering: and he fasten it with nail that it should not be move

41:8 but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the
seed of abraham my friend

41:9 thou whom i have taken from the end of the earth and call
thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my
servant; i have chosen thee and not cast thee away

41:10 fear thou not; for i am with thee: be not dismayed; for i am thi
god: i will strengthen thee; yea i will help thee; yea i will uphold
thee with the right hand of my righteous

41:11 behold all they that were incens against thee shall be
asham and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive
with thee shall perish

41:12 thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that
contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as noth
and as a thing of nought

41:13 for i the lord thi god will hold thi right hand say unto
thee fear not; i will help thee

41:14 fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel; i will help
thee saith the lord and thi redeem the holi one of israel

41:15 behold i will make thee a new sharp thresh instrument have
teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountain and beat them small and shalt
make the hill as chaff

41:16 thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carri them away and the
whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoic in the lord and
shalt glori in the holi one of israel

41:17 when the poor and needi seek water and there is none and their
tongu faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of
israel will not forsak them

41:18 i will open river in high place and fountain in the midst of
the valleys: i will make the wilder a pool of water and the dri
land spring of water

41:19 i will plant in the wilder the cedar the shittah tree and
the myrtl and the oil tree; i will set in the desert the fir tree
and the pine and the box tree together: 41:20 that they may see and
know and consid and understand togeth that the hand of the lord
hath done thi and the holi one of israel hath creat it

41:21 produc your caus saith the lord; bring forth your strong
reason saith the king of jacob

41:22 let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen: let
them shew the former thing what they be that we may consid them
and know the latter end of them; or declar us thing for to come

41:23 shew the thing that are to come hereaft that we may know
that ye are gods: yea do good or do evil that we may be dismay
and behold it togeth

41:24 behold ye are of noth and your work of nought: an
abomin is he that chooseth you

41:25 i have rais up one from the north and he shall come: from the
rise of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon
princ as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay

41:26 who hath declar from the begin that we may know? and
beforetim that we may say he is righteous? yea there is none that
sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that
heareth your word

41:27 the first shall say to zion behold behold them: and i will
give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tide

41:28 for i beheld and there wa no man; even among them and there
wa no counsellor that when i ask of them could answer a word

41:29 behold they are all vanity; their work are nothing: their
molten imag are wind and confus

42:1 behold my servant whom i uphold; mine elect in whom my soul
delighteth; i have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth
judgment to the gentil

42:2 he shall not cri nor lift up nor caus hi voic to be heard in
the street

42:3 a bruis reed shall he not break and the smoke flax shall he
not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth

42:4 he shall not fail nor be discourag till he have set judgment
in the earth: and the isl shall wait for hi law

42:5 thu saith god the lord he that creat the heaven and
stretch them out; he that spread forth the earth and that which
cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the peopl upon it and
spirit to them that walk therein: 42:6 i the lord have call thee in
righteous and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give
thee for a coven of the peopl for a light of the gentiles; 42:7
to open the blind eye to bring out the prison from the prison
and them that sit in dark out of the prison hous

42:8 i am the lord: that is my name: and my glori will i not give to
anoth neither my prais to graven imag

42:9 behold the former thing are come to pass and new thing do i
declare: befor they spring forth i tell you of them

42:10 sing unto the lord a new song and hi prais from the end of
the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein; the
isl and the inhabit thereof

42:11 let the wilder and the citi thereof lift up their voic
the villag that kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabit of the rock
sing let them shout from the top of the mountain

42:12 let them give glori unto the lord and declar hi prais in the
island

42:13 the lord shall go forth as a mighti man he shall stir up
jealousi like a man of war: he shall cri yea roar; he shall prevail
against hi enemi

42:14 i have long time holden my peace; i have been still and
refrain myself: now will i cri like a travail woman; i will
destroy and devour at onc

42:15 i will make wast mountain and hill and dri up all their
herbs; and i will make the river island and i will dri up the
pool

42:16 and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; i will
lead them in path that they have not known: i will make dark
light befor them and crook thing straight these thing will i do
unto them and not forsak them

42:17 they shall be turn back they shall be greatli asham that
trust in graven imag that say to the molten imag ye are our
god

42:18 hear ye deaf; and look ye blind that ye may see

42:19 who is blind but my servant? or deaf as my messeng that i
sent? who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lord
servant? 42:20 see mani thing but thou observest not; open
the ear but he heareth not

42:21 the lord is well pleas for hi righteous sake; he will
magnifi the law and make it honour

42:22 but thi is a peopl rob and spoiled; they are all of them
snare in hole and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a
prey and none delivereth; for a spoil and none saith restor

42:23 who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
for the time to come? 42:24 who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to
the robbers? did not the lord he against whom we have sinned? for
they would not walk in hi way neither were they obedi unto hi
law

42:25 therefor he hath pour upon him the furi of hi anger and the
strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about yet he
knew not; and it burn him yet he laid it not to heart

43:1 but now thu saith the lord that creat thee o jacob and he
that form thee o israel fear not: for i have redeem thee i have
call thee by thi name; thou art mine

43:2 when thou passest through the water i will be with thee; and
through the river they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindl upon thee

43:3 for i am the lord thi god the holi one of israel thi saviour: i
gave egypt for thi ransom ethiopia and seba for thee

43:4 sinc thou wast preciou in my sight thou hast been honour
and i have love thee: therefor will i give men for thee and peopl
for thi life

43:5 fear not: for i am with thee: i will bring thi seed from the
east and gather thee from the west; 43:6 i will say to the north
give up; and to the south keep not back: bring my son from far and
my daughter from the end of the earth; 43:7 even everi one that is
call by my name: for i have creat him for my glori i have form
him; yea i have made him

43:8 bring forth the blind peopl that have eye and the deaf that
have ear

43:9 let all the nation be gather togeth and let the peopl be
assembled: who among them can declar thi and shew us former things?
let them bring forth their wit that they may be justified: or
let them hear and say it is truth

43:10 ye are my wit saith the lord and my servant whom i have
chosen: that ye may know and believ me and understand that i am he:
befor me there wa no god form neither shall there be after me

43:11 i even i am the lord; and besid me there is no saviour

43:12 i have declar and have save and i have shew when there
wa no strang god among you: therefor ye are my wit saith the
lord that i am god

43:13 yea befor the day wa i am he; and there is none that can
deliv out of my hand: i will work and who shall let it? 43:14 thu
saith the lord your redeem the holi one of israel; for your sake i
have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobl and the
chaldean whose cri is in the ship

43:15 i am the lord your holi one the creator of israel your king

43:16 thu saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path
in the mighti waters; 43:17 which bringeth forth the chariot and
hors the armi and the power; they shall lie down togeth they
shall not rise: they are extinct they are quench as tow

43:18 rememb ye not the former thing neither consid the thing
of old

43:19 behold i will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall
ye not know it? i will even make a way in the wilder and river
in the desert

43:20 the beast of the field shall honour me the dragon and the
owls: becaus i give water in the wilder and river in the
desert to give drink to my peopl my chosen

43:21 thi peopl have i form for myself; they shall shew forth my
prais

43:22 but thou hast not call upon me o jacob; but thou hast been
weari of me o israel

43:23 thou hast not brought me the small cattl of thi burnt
offerings; neither hast thou honour me with thi sacrific i have
not caus thee to serv with an offer nor weari thee with
incens

43:24 thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou
fill me with the fat of thi sacrifices: but thou hast made me to
serv with thi sin thou hast weari me with thine iniqu

43:25 i even i am he that blotteth out thi transgress for mine
own sake and will not rememb thi sin

43:26 put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declar thou that
thou mayest be justifi

43:27 thi first father hath sin and thi teacher have transgress
against me

43:28 therefor i have profan the princ of the sanctuari and have
given jacob to the curs and israel to reproach

44:1 yet now hear o jacob my servant; and israel whom i have chosen:
44:2 thu saith the lord that made thee and form thee from the
womb which will help thee; fear not o jacob my servant; and thou
jesurun whom i have chosen

44:3 for i will pour water upon him that is thirsti and flood upon
the dri ground: i will pour my spirit upon thi seed and my bless
upon thine offspring: 44:4 and they shall spring up as among the
grass as willow by the water cours

44:5 one shall say i am the lords; and anoth shall call himself by
the name of jacob; and anoth shall subscrib with hi hand unto the
lord and surnam himself by the name of israel

44:6 thu saith the lord the king of israel and hi redeem the lord
of hosts; i am the first and i am the last; and besid me there is no
god

44:7 and who as i shall call and shall declar it and set it in
order for me sinc i appoint the ancient people? and the thing
that are come and shall come let them shew unto them

44:8 fear ye not neither be afraid: have not i told thee from that
time and have declar it? ye are even my wit is there a god
besid me? yea there is no god; i know not ani

44:9 they that make a graven imag are all of them vanity; and their
delect thing shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses;
they see not nor know; that they may be asham

44:10 who hath form a god or molten a graven imag that is
profit for nothing? 44:11 behold all hi fellow shall be
ashamed: and the workmen they are of men: let them all be gather
togeth let them stand up; yet they shall fear and they shall be
asham togeth

44:12 the smith with the tong both worketh in the coal and
fashioneth it with hammer and worketh it with the strength of hi
arms: yea he is hungri and hi strength faileth: he drinketh no
water and is faint

44:13 the carpent stretcheth out hi rule; he marketh it out with a
line; he fitteth it with plane and he marketh it out with the
compass and maketh it after the figur of a man accord to the
beauti of a man; that it may remain in the hous

44:14 he heweth him down cedar and taketh the cypress and the oak
which he strengtheneth for himself among the tree of the forest: he
planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it

44:15 then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof
and warm himself; yea he kindleth it and baketh bread; yea he
maketh a god and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven imag and
falleth down thereto

44:16 he burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth
flesh; he roasteth roast and is satisfied: yea he warmeth himself
and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire: 44:17 and the residu
thereof he maketh a god even hi graven image: he falleth down unto
it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliv me;
for thou art my god

44:18 they have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eye
that they cannot see; and their heart that they cannot understand

44:19 and none considereth in hi heart neither is there knowledg
nor understand to say i have burn part of it in the fire; yea
also i have bake bread upon the coal thereof; i have roast flesh
and eaten it: and shall i make the residu thereof an abomination?
shall i fall down to the stock of a tree? 44:20 he feedeth on ashes:
a deceiv heart hath turn him asid that he cannot deliv hi
soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand? 44:21 rememb
these o jacob and israel; for thou art my servant: i have form
thee; thou art my servant: o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of

44:22 i have blot out as a thick cloud thi transgress and

44:23 sing o ye heavens; for the lord hath done it: shout ye lower
part of the earth: break forth into sing ye mountain o forest
and everi tree therein: for the lord hath redeem jacob and
glorifi himself in israel

44:24 thu saith the lord thi redeem and he that form thee from
the womb i am the lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth
the heaven alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; 44:25
that frustrateth the token of the liar and maketh divin mad;
that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledg foolish;
44:26 that confirmeth the word of hi servant and performeth the
counsel of hi messengers; that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be
inhabited; and to the citi of judah ye shall be built and i will
rais up the decay place thereof: 44:27 that saith to the deep be
dri and i will dri up thi rivers: 44:28 that saith of cyru he is my
shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure: even say to jerusalem
thou shalt be built; and to the templ thi foundat shall be laid

45:1 thu saith the lord to hi anoint to cyru whose right hand i
have holden to subdu nation befor him; and i will loos the loin
of king to open befor him the two leav gates; and the gate shall
not be shut; 45:2 i will go befor thee and make the crook place
straight: i will break in piec the gate of brass and cut in sunder
the bar of iron: 45:3 and i will give thee the treasur of dark
and hidden rich of secret place that thou mayest know that i the
lord which call thee by thi name am the god of israel

45:4 for jacob my servant sake and israel mine elect i have even
call thee by thi name: i have surnam thee though thou hast not
known me

45:5 i am the lord and there is none els there is no god besid me:
i gird thee though thou hast not known me: 45:6 that they may know
from the rise of the sun and from the west that there is none
besid me i am the lord and there is none els

45:7 i form the light and creat darkness: i make peac and creat
evil: i the lord do all these thing

45:8 drop down ye heaven from abov and let the sky pour down
righteousness: let the earth open and let them bring forth salvat
and let righteous spring up together; i the lord have creat it

45:9 woe unto him that striveth with hi maker! let the potsherd
strive with the potsherd of the earth shall the clay say to him that
fashioneth it what makest thou? or thi work he hath no hands? 45:10
woe unto him that saith unto hi father what begettest thou? or to
the woman what hast thou brought forth? 45:11 thu saith the lord
the holi one of israel and hi maker ask me of thing to come
concern my son and concern the work of my hand command ye me

45:12 i have made the earth and creat man upon it: i even my
hand have stretch out the heaven and all their host have i

45:13 i have rais him up in righteous and i will direct all hi
ways: he shall build my citi and he shall let go my captiv not for
price nor reward saith the lord of host

45:14 thu saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandis of
ethiopia and of the sabean men of statur shall come over unto
thee and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chain
they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall

is none els there is no god

45:15 verili thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the
saviour

45:16 they shall be asham and also confound all of them: they
shall go to confus togeth that are maker of idol

45:17 but israel shall be save in the lord with an everlast
salvation: ye shall not be asham nor confound world without end

45:18 for thu saith the lord that creat the heavens; god himself
that form the earth and made it; he hath establish it he creat
it not in vain he form it to be inhabited: i am the lord; and there

from that time? have not i the lord? and there is no god els besid
me; a just god and a saviour; there is none besid me

45:22 look unto me and be ye save all the end of the earth: for i

46:5 to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compar me that

silver in the balanc and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god:
they fall down yea they worship

46:7 they bear him upon the shoulder they carri him and set him in

one shall cri unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of hi
troubl

46:8 rememb thi and shew yourselv men: bring it again to mind o

47:3 thi naked shall be uncov yea thi shame shall be seen: i

47:5 sit thou silent and get thee into dark o daughter of the
chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be call the ladi of kingdom

47:6 i wa wroth with my peopl i have pollut mine inherit and
given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the

47:7 and thou saidst i shall be a ladi for ever: so that thou didst

end of it

47:8 therefor hear now thi thou that art given to pleasur that

in one day the loss of children and widowhood: they shall come upon
thee in their perfect for the multitud of thi sorceri and for
the great abund of thine enchant

47:10 for thou hast trust in thi wickedness: thou hast said none
seeth me thi wisdom and thi knowledg it hath pervert thee; and
thou hast said in thine heart i am and none els besid me

47:11 therefor shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
whenc it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be
abl to put it off: and desol shall come upon thee suddenli
which thou shalt not know

47:12 stand now with thine enchant and with the multitud of thi
sorceri wherein thou hast labour from thi youth; if so be thou

and save thee from these thing that shall come upon thee

47:14 behold they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they

not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit befor it

47:15 thu shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast labour even
thi merchant from thi youth: they shall wander everi one to hi
quarter; none shall save thee

48:1 hear ye thi o hous of jacob which are call by the name of
israel and are come forth out of the water of judah which swear by
the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not

48:2 for they call themselv of the holi citi and stay themselv
upon the god of israel; the lord of host is hi name

48:3 i have declar the former thing from the beginning; and they
went forth out of my mouth and i shew them; i did them suddenli
and they came to pass

48:4 becaus i knew that thou art obstin and thi neck is an iron
sinew and thi brow brass; 48:5 i have even from the begin

thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven imag and
my molten imag hath command them

48:6 thou hast heard see all this; and will not ye declar it? i have

48:8 yea thou heardest not; yea thou knewest not; yea from that
time that thine ear wa not opened: for i knew that thou wouldest deal
veri treacher and wast call a transgressor from the womb

48:9 for my name sake will i defer mine anger and for my prais
will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off

48:10 behold i have refin thee but not with silver; i have chosen
thee in the furnac of afflict

48:11 for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it: for how
should my name be polluted? and i will not give my glori unto anoth

48:12 hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called; i am he; i am
the first i also am the last

48:13 mine hand also hath laid the foundat of the earth and my
right hand hath span the heavens: when i call unto them they stand
up togeth

48:14 all ye assembl yourselv and hear; which among them hath
declar these things? the lord hath love him: he will do hi
pleasur on babylon and hi arm shall be on the chaldean

48:15 i even i have spoken; yea i have call him: i have brought
him and he shall make hi way prosper

48:16 come ye near unto me hear ye this; i have not spoken in secret
from the beginning; from the time that it wa there am i: and now the
lord god and hi spirit hath sent me

48:17 thu saith the lord thi redeem the holi one of israel; i am
the lord thi god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by
the way that thou shouldest go

48:18 o that thou hadst hearken to my commandments! then had thi
peac been as a river and thi righteous as the wave of the sea:
48:19 thi seed also had been as the sand and the offspr of thi
bowel like the gravel thereof; hi name should not have been cut off
nor destroy from befor me

48:20 go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldean with a voic
of sing declar ye tell thi utter it even to the end of the
earth; say ye the lord hath redeem hi servant jacob

48:21 and they thirst not when he led them through the deserts: he
caus the water to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock
also and the water gush out

48:22 there is no peac saith the lord unto the wick

49:1 listen o isl unto me; and hearken ye peopl from far; the
lord hath call me from the womb; from the bowel of my mother hath
he made mention of my name

49:2 and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
hi hand hath he hid me and made me a polish shaft; in hi quiver
hath he hid me; 49:3 and said unto me thou art my servant o israel
in whom i will be glorifi

49:4 then i said i have labour in vain i have spent my strength
for nought and in vain: yet sure my judgment is with the lord and
my work with my god

49:5 and now saith the lord that form me from the womb to be hi
servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gather
yet shall i be gloriou in the eye of the lord and my god shall be
my strength

49:6 and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
servant to rais up the tribe of jacob and to restor the preserv
of israel: i will also give thee for a light to the gentil that
thou mayest be my salvat unto the end of the earth

49:7 thu saith the lord the redeem of israel and hi holi one to
him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant
of ruler king shall see and aris princ also shall worship
becaus of the lord that is faith and the holi one of israel and
he shall choos thee

49:8 thu saith the lord in an accept time have i heard thee and
in a day of salvat have i help thee: and i will preserv thee
and give thee for a coven of the peopl to establish the earth to
caus to inherit the desol heritages; 49:9 that thou mayest say to
the prison go forth; to them that are in dark shew
yourselv they shall feed in the way and their pastur shall be
in all high place

49:10 they shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
smite them: for he that hath merci on them shall lead them even by
the spring of water shall he guid them

49:11 and i will make all my mountain a way and my highway shall be
exalt

49:12 behold these shall come from far: and lo these from the north
and from the west; and these from the land of sinim

49:13 sing o heavens; and be joy o earth; and break forth into
sing o mountains: for the lord hath comfort hi peopl and will
have merci upon hi afflict

49:14 but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath
forgotten me

49:15 can a woman forget her suck child that she should not have
compass on the son of her womb? yea they may forget yet will i
not forget thee

49:16 behold i have graven thee upon the palm of my hands; thi wall
are continu befor me

49:17 thi children shall make haste; thi destroy and they that made
thee wast shall go forth of thee

49:18 lift up thine eye round about and behold: all these gather
themselv togeth and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou
shalt sure cloth thee with them all as with an ornament and bind
them on thee as a bride doeth

49:19 for thi wast and thi desol place and the land of thi
destruct shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
inhabit and they that swallow thee up shall be far away

49:20 the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the
other shall say again in thine ear the place is too strait for me:
give place to me that i may dwell

49:21 then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these
see i have lost my children and am desol a captiv and
remov to and fro? and who hath brought up these? behold i wa left
alone; these where had they been? 49:22 thu saith the lord god
behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentil and set up my
standard to the people: and they shall bring thi son in their arm
and thi daughter shall be carri upon their shoulder

49:23 and king shall be thi nurs father and their queen thi
nurs mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward
the earth and lick up the dust of thi feet; and thou shalt know that
i am the lord: for they shall not be asham that wait for me

49:24 shall the prey be taken from the mighti or the law captiv
delivered? 49:25 but thu saith the lord even the captiv of the
mighti shall be taken away and the prey of the terribl shall be
delivered: for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and
i will save thi children

49:26 and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and
they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine: and
all flesh shall know that i the lord am thi saviour and thi redeem
the mighti one of jacob

50:1 thu saith the lord where is the bill of your mother
divorc whom i have put away? or which of my creditor is it to
whom i have sold you? behold for your iniqu have ye sold
yourselv and for your transgress is your mother put away

50:2 wherefor when i came wa there no man? when i call wa
there none to answer? is my hand shorten at all that it cannot
redeem? or have i no power to deliver? behold at my rebuk i dri up
the sea i make the river a wilderness: their fish stinketh becaus
there is no water and dieth for thirst

50:3 i cloth the heaven with black and i make sackcloth their
cover

50:4 the lord god hath given me the tongu of the learn that i
should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he
wakeneth morn by morn he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the
learn

50:5 the lord god hath open mine ear and i wa not rebelli
neither turn away back

50:6 i gave my back to the smiter and my cheek to them that pluck
off the hair: i hid not my face from shame and spit

50:7 for the lord god will help me; therefor shall i not be
confounded: therefor have i set my face like a flint and i know that
i shall not be asham

50:8 he is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me

50:9 behold the lord god will help me; who is he that shall condemn
me? lo they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them
up

50:10 who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voic
of hi servant that walketh in dark and hath no light? let him
trust in the name of the lord and stay upon hi god

50:11 behold all ye that kindl a fire that compass yourselv about
with sparks: walk in the light of your fire and in the spark that ye
have kindl thi shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in
sorrow

51:1 hearken to me ye that follow after righteous ye that seek
the lord: look unto the rock whenc ye are hewn and to the hole of
the pit whenc ye are dig

51:2 look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you: for
i call him alon and bless him and increas him

51:3 for the lord shall comfort zion: he will comfort all her wast
places; and he will make her wilder like eden and her desert like
the garden of the lord; joy and glad shall be found therein
thanksgiv and the voic of melodi

51:4 hearken unto me my people; and give ear unto me o my nation:
for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest
for a light of the peopl

51:5 my righteous is near; my salvat is gone forth and mine
arm shall judg the people; the isl shall wait upon me and on mine
arm shall they trust

51:6 lift up your eye to the heaven and look upon the earth
beneath: for the heaven shall vanish away like smoke and the earth
shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in
like manner: but my salvat shall be for ever and my righteous
shall not be abolish

51:7 hearken unto me ye that know righteous the peopl in whose
heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid
of their revil

51:8 for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall
eat them like wool: but my righteous shall be for ever and my
salvat from gener to gener

51:9 awak awak put on strength o arm of the lord; awak as in
the ancient day in the gener of old art thou not it that hath
cut rahab and wound the dragon? 51:10 art thou not it which hath
dri the sea the water of the great deep; that hath made the depth
of the sea a way for the ransom to pass over? 51:11 therefor the
redeem of the lord shall return and come with sing unto zion;
and everlast joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain
glad and joy; and sorrow and mourn shall flee away

51:12 i even i am he that comforteth you: who art thou that thou
shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man
which shall be made as grass; 51:13 and forgettest the lord thi maker
that hath stretch forth the heaven and laid the foundat of the
earth; and hast fear continu everi day becaus of the furi of
the oppressor as if he were readi to destroy? and where is the furi
of the oppressor? 51:14 the captiv exil hasteneth that he may be
loos and that he should not die in the pit nor that hi bread
should fail

51:15 but i am the lord thi god that divid the sea whose wave
roared: the lord of host is hi name

51:16 and i have put my word in thi mouth and i have cover thee in
the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heaven and lay the
foundat of the earth and say unto zion thou art my peopl

51:17 awak awak stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the
hand of the lord the cup of hi fury; thou hast drunken the dreg of
the cup of trembl and wrung them out

51:18 there is none to guid her among all the son whom she hath
brought forth; neither is there ani that taketh her by the hand of all
the son that she hath brought up

51:19 these two thing are come unto thee; who shall be sorri for
thee? desol and destruct and the famin and the sword: by
whom shall i comfort thee? 51:20 thi son have faint they lie at
the head of all the street as a wild bull in a net: they are full of
the furi of the lord the rebuk of thi god

51:21 therefor hear now thi thou afflict and drunken but not

pleadeth the caus of hi peopl behold i have taken out of thine
hand the cup of trembl even the dreg of the cup of my fury; thou
shalt no more drink it again: 51:23 but i will put it into the hand of
them that afflict thee; which have said to thi soul bow down that we
may go over: and thou hast laid thi bodi as the ground and as the
street to them that went over

52:1 awak awake; put on thi strength o zion; put on thi beauti
garment o jerusalem the holi city: for henceforth there shall no
more come into thee the uncircumcis and the unclean

52:2 shake thyself from the dust; aris and sit down o jerusalem:
loos thyself from the band of thi neck o captiv daughter of zion

52:3 for thu saith the lord ye have sold yourselv for nought; and
ye shall be redeem without money

52:4 for thu saith the lord god my peopl went down aforetim into
egypt to sojourn there; and the assyrian oppress them without caus

52:5 now therefor what have i here saith the lord that my peopl
is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl
saith the lord; and my name continu everi day is blasphem

52:6 therefor my peopl shall know my name: therefor they shall know
in that day that i am he that doth speak: behold it is i

52:7 how beauti upon the mountain are the feet of him that
bringeth good tide that publisheth peace; that bringeth good
tide of good that publisheth salvation; that saith unto zion thi
god reigneth! 52:8 thi watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the
voic togeth shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye when
the lord shall bring again zion

52:9 break forth into joy sing togeth ye wast place of
jerusalem: for the lord hath comfort hi peopl he hath redeem
jerusalem

52:10 the lord hath made bare hi holi arm in the eye of all the
nations; and all the end of the earth shall see the salvat of our
god

52:11 depart ye depart ye go ye out from thenc touch no unclean
thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean that bear the
vessel of the lord

52:12 for ye shall not go out with hast nor go by flight: for the
lord will go befor you; and the god of israel will be your rereward

52:13 behold my servant shall deal prudent he shall be exalt and
extol and be veri high

52:14 as mani were astoni at thee; hi visag wa so mar more
than ani man and hi form more than the son of men: 52:15 so shall
he sprinkl mani nations; the king shall shut their mouth at him:
for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which
they had not heard shall they consid

53:1 who hath believ our report? and to whom is the arm of the lord
revealed? 53:2 for he shall grow up befor him as a tender plant and
as a root out of a dri ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
when we shall see him there is no beauti that we should desir him

53:3 he is despis and reject of men; a man of sorrow and
acquaint with grief: and we hid as it were our face from him; he
wa despis and we esteem him not

53:4 sure he hath born our grief and carri our sorrows: yet we
did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflict

53:5 but he wa wound for our transgress he wa bruis for our
iniquities: the chastis of our peac wa upon him; and with hi
stripe we are heal

53:6 all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turn everi one to
hi own way; and the lord hath laid on him the iniqu of us all

53:7 he wa oppress and he wa afflict yet he open not hi
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep befor
her shearer is dumb so he openeth not hi mouth

53:8 he wa taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declar
hi generation? for he wa cut off out of the land of the living: for
the transgress of my peopl wa he stricken

53:9 and he made hi grave with the wick and with the rich in hi
death; becaus he had done no violenc neither wa ani deceit in hi
mouth

53:10 yet it pleas the lord to bruis him; he hath put him to grief:
when thou shalt make hi soul an offer for sin he shall see hi
seed he shall prolong hi day and the pleasur of the lord shall
prosper in hi hand

53:11 he shall see of the travail of hi soul and shall be satisfied:
by hi knowledg shall my righteou servant justifi many; for he shall
bear their iniqu

53:12 therefor will i divid him a portion with the great and he
shall divid the spoil with the strong; becaus he hath pour out hi
soul unto death: and he wa number with the transgressors; and he
bare the sin of mani and made intercess for the transgressor

54:1 sing o barren thou that didst not bear; break forth into
sing and cri aloud thou that didst not travail with child: for
more are the children of the desol than the children of the marri
wife saith the lord

54:2 enlarg the place of thi tent and let them stretch forth the
curtain of thine habitations: spare not lengthen thi cord and
strengthen thi stakes; 54:3 for thou shalt break forth on the right
hand and on the left; and thi seed shall inherit the gentil and
make the desol citi to be inhabit

54:4 fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget
the shame of thi youth and shalt not rememb the reproach of thi
widowhood ani more

54:5 for thi maker is thine husband; the lord of host is hi name;
and thi redeem the holi one of israel; the god of the whole earth
shall he be call

54:6 for the lord hath call thee as a woman forsaken and griev in
spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refus saith thi god

54:7 for a small moment have i forsaken thee; but with great merci
will i gather thee

54:8 in a littl wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
everlast kind will i have merci on thee saith the lord thi
redeem

54:9 for thi is as the water of noah unto me: for as i have sworn
that the water of noah should no more go over the earth; so have i
sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuk thee

54:10 for the mountain shall depart and the hill be removed; but my
kind shall not depart from thee neither shall the coven of my
peac be remov saith the lord that hath merci on thee

54:11 o thou afflict toss with tempest and not comfort
behold i will lay thi stone with fair colour and lay thi
foundat with sapphir

54:12 and i will make thi window of agat and thi gate of
carbuncl and all thi border of pleasant stone

54:13 and all thi children shall be taught of the lord; and great
shall be the peac of thi children

54:14 in righteous shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it
shall not come near thee

54:15 behold they shall sure gather togeth but not by me:
whosoev shall gather togeth against thee shall fall for thi sake

54:16 behold i have creat the smith that bloweth the coal in the
fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for hi work; and i have
creat the waster to destroy

54:17 no weapon that is form against thee shall prosper; and everi
tongu that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn
thi is the heritag of the servant of the lord and their
righteous is of me saith the lord

55:1 ho everi one that thirsteth come ye to the water and he that
hath no money; come ye buy and eat; yea come buy wine and milk
without money and without price

55:2 wherefor do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken dilig unto me and
eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in
fat

55:3 inclin your ear and come unto me: hear and your soul shall
live; and i will make an everlast coven with you even the sure
merci of david

55:4 behold i have given him for a wit to the peopl a leader
and command to the peopl

55:5 behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and
nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee becaus of the lord thi
god and for the holi one of israel; for he hath glorifi thee

55:6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he
is near: 55:7 let the wick forsak hi way and the unright man
hi thoughts: and let him return unto the lord and he will have merci
upon him; and to our god for he will abundantli pardon

55:8 for my thought are not your thought neither are your way my
way saith the lord

55:9 for as the heaven are higher than the earth so are my way
higher than your way and my thought than your thought

55:10 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and
returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring
forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the
eater: 55:11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it
shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i
pleas and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it

55:12 for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace: the
mountain and the hill shall break forth befor you into sing and
all the tree of the field shall clap their hand

55:13 instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of
the brier shall come up the myrtl tree: and it shall be to the lord
for a name for an everlast sign that shall not be cut off

56:1 thu saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice: for my
salvat is near to come and my righteous to be reveal

56:2 bless is the man that doeth thi and the son of man that
layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from pollut it and
keepeth hi hand from do ani evil

56:3 neither let the son of the stranger that hath join himself to
the lord speak say the lord hath utterli separ me from hi
people: neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dri tree

56:4 for thu saith the lord unto the eunuch that keep my sabbath
and choos the thing that pleas me and take hold of my covenant;
56:5 even unto them will i give in mine hous and within my wall a
place and a name better than of son and of daughters: i will give
them an everlast name that shall not be cut off

56:6 also the son of the stranger that join themselv to the lord
to serv him and to love the name of the lord to be hi servant
everi one that keepeth the sabbath from pollut it and taketh hold
of my covenant; 56:7 even them will i bring to my holi mountain and
make them joy in my hous of prayer: their burnt offer and
their sacrific shall be accept upon mine altar; for mine hous
shall be call an hous of prayer for all peopl

56:8 the lord god which gathereth the outcast of israel saith yet
will i gather other to him besid those that are gather unto him

56:9 all ye beast of the field come to devour yea all ye beast in
the forest

56:10 hi watchmen are blind: they are all ignor they are all dumb
dog they cannot bark; sleep lie down love to slumber

56:11 yea they are greedi dog which can never have enough and they
are shepherd that cannot understand: they all look to their own way
everi one for hi gain from hi quarter

56:12 come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselv
with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as thi day and much more
abund

57:1 the righteou perisheth and no man layeth it to heart: and
merci men are taken away none consid that the righteou is
taken away from the evil to come

57:2 he shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their bed each
one walk in hi upright

57:3 but draw near hither ye son of the sorceress the seed of the
adulter and the whore

57:4 against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide
mouth and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgress
a seed of falsehood

57:5 enflam yourselv with idol under everi green tree slay
the children in the valley under the clift of the rocks? 57:6 among
the smooth stone of the stream is thi portion; they they are thi
lot: even to them hast thou pour a drink offer thou hast offer
a meat offer should i receiv comfort in these? 57:7 upon a lofti
and high mountain hast thou set thi bed: even thither wentest thou up
to offer sacrific

57:8 behind the door also and the post hast thou set up thi
remembrance: for thou hast discov thyself to anoth than me and
art gone up; thou hast enlarg thi bed and made thee a coven with
them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it

57:9 and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increas
thi perfum and didst send thi messeng far off and didst debas
thyself even unto hell

57:10 thou art weari in the great of thi way; yet saidst thou
not there is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;
therefor thou wast not griev

57:11 and of whom hast thou been afraid or fear that thou hast
lie and hast not rememb me nor laid it to thi heart? have not i
held my peac even of old and thou fearest me not? 57:12 i will
declar thi righteous and thi works; for they shall not profit
thee

57:13 when thou criest let thi compani deliv thee; but the wind
shall carri them all away; vaniti shall take them: but he that putteth
hi trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holi
mountain; 57:14 and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepar the
way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my peopl

57:15 for thu saith the high and lofti one that inhabiteth etern
whose name is holy; i dwell in the high and holi place with him also
that is of a contrit and humbl spirit to reviv the spirit of the
humbl and to reviv the heart of the contrit one

57:16 for i will not contend for ever neither will i be alway wroth:
for the spirit should fail befor me and the soul which i have made

57:17 for the iniqu of hi covet wa i wroth and smote him:
i hid me and wa wroth and he went on frowardli in the way of hi
heart

57:18 i have seen hi way and will heal him: i will lead him also
and restor comfort unto him and to hi mourner

57:19 i creat the fruit of the lips; peac peac to him that is far
off and to him that is near saith the lord; and i will heal him

57:20 but the wick are like the troubl sea when it cannot rest
whose water cast up mire and dirt

57:21 there is no peac saith my god to the wick

58:1 cri aloud spare not lift up thi voic like a trumpet and shew
my peopl their transgress and the hous of jacob their sin

58:2 yet they seek me daili and delight to know my way as a nation
that did righteous and forsook not the ordin of their god:
they ask of me the ordin of justice; they take delight in
approach to god

58:3 wherefor have we fast say they and thou seest not? wherefor
have we afflict our soul and thou takest no knowledge? behold in
the day of your fast ye find pleasur and exact all your labour

58:4 behold ye fast for strife and debat and to smite with the fist
of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do thi day to make your voic
to be heard on high

58:5 is it such a fast that i have chosen? a day for a man to afflict
hi soul? is it to bow down hi head as a bulrush and to spread
sackcloth and ash under him? wilt thou call thi a fast and an
accept day to the lord? 58:6 is not thi the fast that i have
chosen? to loos the band of wicked to undo the heavi burden
and to let the oppress go free and that ye break everi yoke? 58:7
is it not to deal thi bread to the hungri and that thou bring the
poor that are cast out to thi house? when thou seest the nake that
thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
58:8 then shall thi light break forth as the morn and thine health
shall spring forth speedily: and thi righteous shall go befor
thee; the glori of the lord shall be thi rereward

58:9 then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer; thou shalt cri
and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee
the yoke the put forth of the finger and speak vanity; 58:10
and if thou draw out thi soul to the hungri and satisfi the afflict
soul; then shall thi light rise in obscur and thi dark be as
the noon day: 58:11 and the lord shall guid thee continu and
satisfi thi soul in drought and make fat thi bones: and thou shalt be
like a water garden and like a spring of water whose water fail
not

58:12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old wast places:
thou shalt rais up the foundat of mani generations; and thou
shalt be call the repair of the breach the restor of path to
dwell in

58:13 if thou turn away thi foot from the sabbath from do thi
pleasur on my holi day; and call the sabbath a delight the holi of
the lord honourable; and shalt honour him not do thine own way
nor find thine own pleasur nor speak thine own words: 58:14
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord; and i will caus thee to
ride upon the high place of the earth and feed thee with the
heritag of jacob thi father: for the mouth of the lord hath spoken
it

59:1 behold the lord hand is not shorten that it cannot save;
neither hi ear heavi that it cannot hear: 59:2 but your iniqu
have separ between you and your god and your sin have hid hi
face from you that he will not hear

59:3 for your hand are defil with blood and your finger with
iniquity; your lip have spoken lie your tongu hath mutter
pervers

59:4 none calleth for justic nor ani pleadeth for truth: they trust
in vaniti and speak lies; they conceiv mischief and bring forth
iniqu

59:5 they hatch cockatric egg and weav the spider web: he that
eateth of their egg dieth and that which is crush breaketh out
into a viper

59:6 their web shall not becom garment neither shall they cover
themselv with their works: their work are work of iniqu and
the act of violenc is in their hand

59:7 their feet run to evil and they make hast to shed innoc
blood: their thought are thought of iniquity; wast and
destruct are in their path

59:8 the way of peac they know not; and there is no judgment in their
goings: they have made them crook paths: whosoev goeth therein
shall not know peac

59:9 therefor is judgment far from us neither doth justic overtak
us: we wait for light but behold obscurity; for bright but we
walk in dark

59:10 we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had
no eyes: we stumbl at noon day as in the night; we are in desol
place as dead men

59:11 we roar all like bear and mourn sore like doves: we look for
judgment but there is none; for salvat but it is far off from us

59:12 for our transgress are multipli befor thee and our sin
testifi against us: for our transgress are with us; and as for our
iniqu we know them; 59:13 in transgress and lie against the
lord and depart away from our god speak oppress and revolt
conceiv and utter from the heart word of falsehood

59:14 and judgment is turn away backward and justic standeth afar
off: for truth is fallen in the street and equiti cannot enter

59:15 yea truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
himself a prey: and the lord saw it and it displeas him that there
wa no judgment

59:16 and he saw that there wa no man and wonder that there wa no
intercessor: therefor hi arm brought salvat unto him; and hi
righteous it sustain him

59:17 for he put on righteous as a breastplat and an helmet of
salvat upon hi head; and he put on the garment of vengeanc for
cloth and wa clad with zeal as a cloak

59:18 accord to their deed accordingli he will repay furi to hi
adversari recomp to hi enemies; to the island he will repay
recomp

61:4 and they shall build the old wast they shall rais up the
former desol and they shall repair the wast citi the
desol of mani gener

61:5 and stranger shall stand and feed your flock and the son of
the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedress

61:6 but ye shall be name the priest of the lord: men shall call you
the minist of our god: ye shall eat the rich of the gentil and
in their glori shall ye boast yourselv

61:7 for your shame ye shall have double; and for confus they shall

the double: everlast joy shall be unto them

61:8 for i the lord love judgment i hate robberi for burnt offering;

coven with them

61:9 and their seed shall be known among the gentil and their

that they are the seed which the lord hath bless

61:10 i will greatli rejoic in the lord my soul shall be joy in
my god; for he hath cloth me with the garment of salvat he hath
cover me with the robe of righteous as a bridegroom decketh
himself with ornament and as a bride adorneth herself with her

61:11 for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden
causeth the thing that are sown in it to spring forth; so the lord
god will caus righteous and prais to spring forth befor all the
nation

62:1 for zion sake will i not hold my peac and for jerusalem
sake i will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth as
bright and the salvat thereof as a lamp that burneth

62:2 and the gentil shall see thi righteous and all king thi
glory: and thou shalt be call by a new name which the mouth of the
lord shall name

62:3 thou shalt also be a crown of glori in the hand of the lord and
a royal diadem in the hand of thi god

62:4 thou shalt no more be term forsaken; neither shall thi land ani
more be term desolate: but thou shalt be call hephzibah and thi
land beulah: for the lord delighteth in thee and thi land shall be
marri

62:5 for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thi son marri
thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thi god
rejoic over thee

62:6 i have set watchmen upon thi wall o jerusalem which shall
never hold their peac day nor night: ye that make mention of the
lord keep not silenc 62:7 and give him no rest till he establish
and till he make jerusalem a prais in the earth

62:8 the lord hath sworn by hi right hand and by the arm of hi
strength sure i will no more give thi corn to be meat for thine
enemies; and the son of the stranger shall not drink thi wine for
the which thou hast laboured: 62:9 but they that have gather it
shall eat it and prais the lord; and they that have brought it
togeth shall drink it in the court of my holi

62:10 go through go through the gates; prepar ye the way of the
people; cast up cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a
standard for the peopl

62:11 behold the lord hath proclaim unto the end of the world say
ye to the daughter of zion behold thi salvat cometh; behold hi
reward is with him and hi work befor him

62:12 and they shall call them the holi peopl the redeem of the
lord: and thou shalt be call sought out a citi not forsaken

63:1 who is thi that cometh from edom with dy garment from
bozrah? thi that is gloriou in hi apparel travel in the
great of hi strength? i that speak in righteous mighti to
save

63:2 wherefor art thou red in thine apparel and thi garment like
him that treadeth in the winefat? 63:3 i have trodden the winepress
alone; and of the peopl there wa none with me: for i will tread them
in mine anger and trampl them in my fury; and their blood shall be
sprinkl upon my garment and i will stain all my raiment

63:4 for the day of vengeanc is in mine heart and the year of my
redeem is come

63:5 and i look and there wa none to help; and i wonder that
there wa none to uphold: therefor mine own arm brought salvat
unto me; and my furi it upheld me

63:6 and i will tread down the peopl in mine anger and make them
drunk in my furi and i will bring down their strength to the earth

63:7 i will mention the lovingkind of the lord and the prais
of the lord accord to all that the lord hath bestow on us and
the great good toward the hous of israel which he hath bestow
on them accord to hi merci and accord to the multitud of
hi lovingkind

63:8 for he said sure they are my peopl children that will not
lie: so he wa their saviour

63:9 in all their afflict he wa afflict and the angel of hi
presenc save them: in hi love and in hi piti he redeem them; and
he bare them and carri them all the day of old

63:10 but they rebel and vex hi holi spirit: therefor he wa
turn to be their enemi and he fought against them

63:11 then he rememb the day of old mose and hi peopl
say where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the
shepherd of hi flock? where is he that put hi holi spirit within
him? 63:12 that led them by the right hand of mose with hi gloriou
arm divid the water befor them to make himself an everlast
name? 63:13 that led them through the deep as an hors in the
wilder that they should not stumble? 63:14 as a beast goeth down
into the valley the spirit of the lord caus him to rest: so didst
thou lead thi peopl to make thyself a gloriou name

63:15 look down from heaven and behold from the habit of thi
holi and of thi glory: where is thi zeal and thi strength the
sound of thi bowel and of thi merci toward me? are they
restrained? 63:16 doubtless thou art our father though abraham be
ignor of us and israel acknowledg us not: thou o lord art our
father our redeemer; thi name is from everlast

63:17 o lord whi hast thou made us to err from thi way and harden
our heart from thi fear? return for thi servant sake the tribe of
thine inherit

63:18 the peopl of thi holi have possess it but a littl while:
our adversari have trodden down thi sanctuari

63:19 we are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
call by thi name

64:1 oh that thou wouldest rend the heaven that thou wouldest come
down that the mountain might flow down at thi presenc 64:2 as when
the melt fire burneth the fire causeth the water to boil to make
thi name known to thine adversari that the nation may trembl at
thi presence! 64:3 when thou didst terribl thing which we look
not for thou camest down the mountain flow down at thi presenc

64:4 for sinc the begin of the world men have not heard nor
perceiv by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god besid thee
what he hath prepar for him that waiteth for him

64:5 thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteous those
that rememb thee in thi ways: behold thou art wroth; for we have
sinned: in those is continu and we shall be save

64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteous
are as filthi rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniqu
like the wind have taken us away

64:7 and there is none that calleth upon thi name that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thi face from us and
hast consum us becaus of our iniqu

64:8 but now o lord thou art our father; we are the clay and thou
our potter; and we all are the work of thi hand

64:9 be not wroth veri sore o lord neither rememb iniqu for
ever: behold see we beseech thee we are all thi peopl

64:10 thi holi citi are a wilder zion is a wilder
jerusalem a desol

64:11 our holi and our beauti hous where our father prais
thee is burn up with fire: and all our pleasant thing are laid
wast

64:12 wilt thou refrain thyself for these thing o lord? wilt thou
hold thi peac and afflict us veri sore? 65:1 i am sought of them
that ask not for me; i am found of them that sought me not: i said
behold me behold me unto a nation that wa not call by my name

65:2 i have spread out my hand all the day unto a rebelli peopl
which walketh in a way that wa not good after their own thoughts;
65:3 a peopl that provoketh me to anger continu to my face; that
sacrificeth in garden and burneth incens upon altar of brick; 65:4
which remain among the grave and lodg in the monument which eat
swine flesh and broth of abomin thing is in their vessels;
65:5 which say stand by thyself come not near to me; for i am holier
than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the
day

65:6 behold it is written befor me: i will not keep silenc but
will recompens even recompens into their bosom 65:7 your
iniqu and the iniqu of your father togeth saith the
lord which have burn incens upon the mountain and blasphem me
upon the hills: therefor will i measur their former work into their
bosom

65:8 thu saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and
one saith destroy it not; for a bless is in it: so will i do for
my servant sake that i may not destroy them all

65:9 and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an
inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it and my
servant shall dwell there

65:10 and sharon shall be a fold of flock and the valley of achor a
place for the herd to lie down in for my peopl that have sought me

65:11 but ye are they that forsak the lord that forget my holi
mountain that prepar a tabl for that troop and that furnish the
drink offer unto that number

65:12 therefor will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter: becaus when i call ye did not answer; when
i spake ye did not hear; but did evil befor mine eye and did
choos that wherein i delight not

65:13 therefor thu saith the lord god behold my servant shall
eat but ye shall be hungry: behold my servant shall drink but ye
shall be thirsty: behold my servant shall rejoic but ye shall be
ashamed: 65:14 behold my servant shall sing for joy of heart but ye
shall cri for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexat of spirit

65:15 and ye shall leav your name for a curs unto my chosen: for the
lord god shall slay thee and call hi servant by anoth name: 65:16
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
god of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god
of truth; becaus the former troubl are forgotten and becaus they
are hid from mine eye

65:17 for behold i creat new heaven and a new earth: and the
former shall not be rememb nor come into mind

65:18 but be ye glad and rejoic for ever in that which i create: for
behold i creat jerusalem a rejoic and her peopl a joy

65:19 and i will rejoic in jerusalem and joy in my people: and the
voic of weep shall be no more heard in her nor the voic of
cri

65:20 there shall be no more thenc an infant of day nor an old man
that hath not fill hi days: for the child shall die an hundr
year old; but the sinner be an hundr year old shall be
accurs

65:21 and they shall build hous and inhabit them; and they shall
plant vineyard and eat the fruit of them

65:22 they shall not build and anoth inhabit; they shall not plant
and anoth eat: for as the day of a tree are the day of my peopl
and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hand

65:23 they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble; for
they are the seed of the bless of the lord and their offspr with
them

65:24 and it shall come to pass that befor they call i will answer;
and while they are yet speak i will hear

65:25 the wolf and the lamb shall feed togeth and the lion shall
eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent meat they
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holi mountain saith the lord

66:1 thu saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my
footstool: where is the hous that ye build unto me? and where is the
place of my rest? 66:2 for all those thing hath mine hand made and
all those thing have been saith the lord: but to thi man will i
look even to him that is poor and of a contrit spirit and trembleth
at my word

66:3 he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth
a lamb as if he cut off a dog neck; he that offereth an oblat
as if he offer swine blood; he that burneth incens as if he
bless an idol

yea they have chosen their own way and their soul delighteth in
their abomin

66:4 i also will choos their delus and will bring their fear
upon them; becaus when i call none did answer; when i spake they
did not hear: but they did evil befor mine eye and chose that in
which i delight not

66:5 hear the word of the lord ye that trembl at hi word; your
brethren that hate you that cast you out for my name sake said
let the lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy and they
shall be asham

66:6 a voic of nois from the citi a voic from the templ a voic
of the lord that rendereth recomp to hi enemi

66:7 befor she travail she brought forth; befor her pain came
she wa deliv of a man child

66:8 who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the
earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at
once? for as soon as zion travail she brought forth her children

66:9 shall i bring to the birth and not caus to bring forth? saith
the lord: shall i caus to bring forth and shut the womb? saith thi
god

66:10 rejoic ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that
love her: rejoic for joy with her all ye that mourn for her: 66:11
that ye may suck and be satisfi with the breast of her
consolations; that ye may milk out and be delight with the
abund of her glori

66:12 for thu saith the lord behold i will extend peac to her like
a river and the glori of the gentil like a flow stream: then
shall ye suck ye shall be born upon her side and be dandl upon
her knee

66:13 as one whom hi mother comforteth so will i comfort you; and ye
shall be comfort in jerusalem

66:14 and when ye see thi your heart shall rejoic and your bone
shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the lord shall be known
toward hi servant and hi indign toward hi enemi

66:15 for behold the lord will come with fire and with hi chariot
like a whirlwind to render hi anger with furi and hi rebuk with
flame of fire

66:16 for by fire and by hi sword will the lord plead with all flesh:
and the slain of the lord shall be mani

66:17 they that sanctifi themselv and purifi themselv in the
garden behind one tree in the midst eat swine flesh and the
abomin and the mous shall be consum togeth saith the
lord

66:18 for i know their work and their thoughts: it shall come that i
will gather all nation and tongues; and they shall come and see my
glori

66:19 and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that
escap of them unto the nation to tarshish pul and lud that draw
the bow to tubal and javan to the isl afar off that have not
heard my fame neither have seen my glory; and they shall declar my
glori among the gentil

66:20 and they shall bring all your brethren for an offer unto the
lord out of all nation upon hors and in chariot and in litter
and upon mule and upon swift beast to my holi mountain jerusalem
saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offer in a clean
vessel into the hous of the lord

66:21 and i will also take of them for priest and for levit saith
the lord

66:22 for as the new heaven and the new earth which i will make
shall remain befor me saith the lord so shall your seed and your
name remain

66:23 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to anoth
and from one sabbath to anoth shall all flesh come to worship
befor me saith the lord

66:24 and they shall go forth and look upon the carcas of the men
that have transgress against me: for their worm shall not die
neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhor
unto all flesh




the book of the prophet jeremiah


1:1 the word of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priest that
were in anathoth in the land of benjamin: 1:2 to whom the word of the
lord came in the day of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the
thirteenth year of hi reign

1:3 it came also in the day of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of
judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah
king of judah unto the carri away of jerusalem captiv in the
fifth month

1:4 then the word of the lord came unto me say 1:5 befor i
form thee in the belli i knew thee; and befor thou camest forth out
of the womb i sanctifi thee and i ordain thee a prophet unto the
nation

1:6 then said i ah lord god! behold i cannot speak: for i am a
child

1:7 but the lord said unto me say not i am a child: for thou shalt
go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoev i command thee thou
shalt speak

1:8 be not afraid of their faces: for i am with thee to deliv thee
saith the lord

1:9 then the lord put forth hi hand and touch my mouth and the
lord said unto me behold i have put my word in thi mouth

1:10 see i have thi day set thee over the nation and over the
kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw
down to build and to plant

1:11 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say jeremiah
what seest thou? and i said i see a rod of an almond tree

1:12 then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen: for i will
hasten my word to perform it

1:13 and the word of the lord came unto me the second time say
what seest thou? and i said i see a seeth pot; and the face
thereof is toward the north

1:14 then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break
forth upon all the inhabit of the land

1:15 for lo i will call all the famili of the kingdom of the
north saith the lord; and they shall come and they shall set everi
one hi throne at the enter of the gate of jerusalem and against
all the wall thereof round about and against all the citi of
judah

1:16 and i will utter my judgment against them touch all their
wicked who have forsaken me and have burn incens unto other
god and worship the work of their own hand

1:17 thou therefor gird up thi loin and aris and speak unto them
all that i command thee: be not dismay at their face lest i
confound thee befor them

1:18 for behold i have made thee thi day a defenc citi and an
iron pillar and brasen wall against the whole land against the
king of judah against the princ thereof against the priest
thereof and against the peopl of the land

1:19 and they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
against thee; for i am with thee saith the lord to deliv thee

2:1 moreov the word of the lord came to me say 2:2 go and cri
in the ear of jerusalem say thu saith the lord; i rememb
thee the kind of thi youth the love of thine espous when
thou wentest after me in the wilder in a land that wa not sown

2:3 israel wa holi unto the lord and the firstfruit of hi
increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them
saith the lord

2:4 hear ye the word of the lord o hous of jacob and all the
famili of the hous of israel: 2:5 thu saith the lord what
iniqu have your father found in me that they are gone far from
me and have walk after vaniti and are becom vain? 2:6 neither
said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of
egypt that led us through the wilder through a land of desert
and of pit through a land of drought and of the shadow of death
through a land that no man pass through and where no man dwelt?
2:7 and i brought you into a plenti countri to eat the fruit
thereof and the good thereof; but when ye enter ye defil my
land and made mine heritag an abomin

2:8 the priest said not where is the lord? and they that handl the
law knew me not: the pastor also transgress against me and the
prophet prophesi by baal and walk after thing that do not
profit

2:9 wherefor i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your
children children will i plead

2:10 for pass over the isl of chittim and see; and send unto kedar
and consid dilig and see if there be such a thing

2:11 hath a nation chang their god which are yet no gods? but my
peopl have chang their glori for that which doth not profit

2:12 be astonish o ye heaven at thi and be horribl afraid be
ye veri desol saith the lord

2:13 for my peopl have commit two evils; they have forsaken me the
fountain of live water and hew them out cistern broken
cistern that can hold no water

2:14 is israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? whi is he spoiled?
2:15 the young lion roar upon him and yell and they made hi
land waste: hi citi are burn without inhabit

2:16 also the children of noph and tahapan have broken the crown of
thi head

2:17 hast thou not procur thi unto thyself in that thou hast
forsaken the lord thi god when he led thee by the way? 2:18 and now
what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the water of
sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the
water of the river? 2:19 thine own wicked shall correct thee
and thi backslid shall reprov thee: know therefor and see that
it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thi
god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of host

2:20 for of old time i have broken thi yoke and burst thi bands; and
thou saidst i will not transgress; when upon everi high hill and
under everi green tree thou wanderest play the harlot

2:21 yet i had plant thee a nobl vine wholli a right seed: how
then art thou turn into the degener plant of a strang vine unto
me? 2:22 for though thou wash thee with nitr and take thee much
soap yet thine iniqu is mark befor me saith the lord god

2:23 how canst thou say i am not pollut i have not gone after
baalim? see thi way in the valley know what thou hast done: thou art
a swift dromedari travers her ways; 2:24 a wild ass use to the
wilder that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occas
who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weari
themselves; in her month they shall find her

2:25 withhold thi foot from be unshod and thi throat from thirst:
but thou saidst there is no hope: no; for i have love stranger and
after them will i go

2:26 as the thief is asham when he is found so is the hous of
israel ashamed; they their king their princ and their priest
and their prophet

2:27 say to a stock thou art my father; and to a stone thou hast
brought me forth: for they have turn their back unto me and not
their face: but in the time of their troubl they will say aris and
save us

2:28 but where are thi god that thou hast made thee? let them aris
if they can save thee in the time of thi trouble: for accord to the
number of thi citi are thi god o judah

2:29 wherefor will ye plead with me? ye all have transgress against
me saith the lord

2:30 in vain have i smitten your children; they receiv no
correction: your own sword hath devour your prophet like a
destroy lion

2:31 o gener see ye the word of the lord have i been a
wilder unto israel? a land of darkness? wherefor say my peopl
we are lords; we will come no more unto thee? 2:32 can a maid forget
her ornament or a bride her attire? yet my peopl have forgotten me
day without number

2:33 whi trimmest thou thi way to seek love? therefor hast thou also
taught the wick one thi way

2:34 also in thi skirt is found the blood of the soul of the poor
innocents: i have not found it by secret search but upon all these

2:35 yet thou sayest becaus i am innoc sure hi anger shall
turn from me behold i will plead with thee becaus thou sayest i
have not sin

2:36 whi gaddest thou about so much to chang thi way? thou also shalt
be asham of egypt as thou wast asham of assyria

2:37 yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hand upon thine
head: for the lord hath reject thi confid and thou shalt not
prosper in them

3:1 they say if a man put away hi wife and she go from him and
becom anoth man shall he return unto her again? shall not that
land be greatli polluted? but thou hast play the harlot with mani
lovers; yet return again to me saith the lord

3:2 lift up thine eye unto the high place and see where thou hast
not been lien with in the way hast thou sat for them as the arabian
in the wilderness; and thou hast pollut the land with thi whoredom
and with thi wicked

3:3 therefor the shower have been withholden and there hath been no
latter rain; and thou hadst a whore forehead thou refusedst to be
asham

3:4 wilt thou not from thi time cri unto me my father thou art the
guid of my youth? 3:5 will he reserv hi anger for ever? will he
keep it to the end? behold thou hast spoken and done evil thing as
thou couldest

3:6 the lord said also unto me in the day of josiah the king hast
thou seen that which backslid israel hath done? she is gone up upon
everi high mountain and under everi green tree and there hath play
the harlot

3:7 and i said after she had done all these thing turn thou unto me
but she return not and her treacher sister judah saw it

3:8 and i saw when for all the caus wherebi backslid israel
commit adulteri i had put her away and given her a bill of
divorce; yet her treacher sister judah fear not but went and
play the harlot also

3:9 and it came to pass through the light of her whoredom that
she defil the land and commit adulteri with stone and with
stock

3:10 and yet for all thi her treacher sister judah hath not turn
unto me with her whole heart but feignedli saith the lord

3:11 and the lord said unto me the backslid israel hath justifi
herself more than treacher judah

3:12 go and proclaim these word toward the north and say return
thou backslid israel saith the lord; and i will not caus mine
anger to fall upon you: for i am merci saith the lord and i will
not keep anger for ever

3:13 onli acknowledg thine iniqu that thou hast transgress
against the lord thi god and hast scatter thi way to the stranger
under everi green tree and ye have not obey my voic saith the
lord

3:14 turn o backslid children saith the lord; for i am marri
unto you: and i will take you one of a citi and two of a famili and
i will bring you to zion: 3:15 and i will give you pastor accord
to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledg and understand

3:16 and it shall come to pass when ye be multipli and increas in
the land in those day saith the lord they shall say no more the
ark of the coven of the lord: neither shall it come to mind:
neither shall they rememb it; neither shall they visit it; neither
shall that be done ani more

3:17 at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord;
and all the nation shall be gather unto it to the name of the
lord to jerusalem: neither shall they walk ani more after the
imagin of their evil heart

3:18 in those day the hous of judah shall walk with the hous of
israel and they shall come togeth out of the land of the north to
the land that i have given for an inherit unto your father

3:19 but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give
thee a pleasant land a goodli heritag of the host of nations? and i
said thou shalt call me my father; and shalt not turn away from me

3:20 sure as a wife treacher departeth from her husband so
have ye dealt treacher with me o hous of israel saith the
lord

3:21 a voic wa heard upon the high place weep and supplic
of the children of israel: for they have pervert their way and they
have forgotten the lord their god

3:22 return ye backslid children and i will heal your
backslid

behold we come unto thee; for thou art the lord our god

3:23 truli in vain is salvat hope for from the hill and from the
multitud of mountains: truli in the lord our god is the salvat of
israel

3:24 for shame hath devour the labour of our father from our youth;
their flock and their herd their son and their daughter

3:25 we lie down in our shame and our confus covereth us: for we
have sin against the lord our god we and our father from our
youth even unto thi day and have not obey the voic of the lord
our god

4:1 if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me: and
if thou wilt put away thine abomin out of my sight then shalt
thou not remov

4:2 and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and
in righteousness; and the nation shall bless themselv in him and
in him shall they glori

4:3 for thu saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break
up your fallow ground and sow not among thorn

4:4 circumcis yourselv to the lord and take away the foreskin of
your heart ye men of judah and inhabit of jerusalem: lest my furi
come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it becaus of the
evil of your do

4:5 declar ye in judah and publish in jerusalem; and say blow ye
the trumpet in the land: cri gather togeth and say assembl
yourselv and let us go into the defenc citi

4:6 set up the standard toward zion: retir stay not: for i will
bring evil from the north and a great destruct

4:7 the lion is come up from hi thicket and the destroy of the
gentil is on hi way; he is gone forth from hi place to make thi
land desolate; and thi citi shall be laid wast without an
inhabit

4:8 for thi gird you with sackcloth lament and howl: for the fierc
anger of the lord is not turn back from us

4:9 and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes; and the
priest shall be astonish and the prophet shall wonder

4:10 then said i ah lord god! sure thou hast greatli deceiv thi
peopl and jerusalem say ye shall have peace; wherea the sword
reacheth unto the soul

4:11 at that time shall it be said to thi peopl and to jerusalem a
dri wind of the high place in the wilder toward the daughter of
my peopl not to fan nor to cleans 4:12 even a full wind from
those place shall come unto me: now also will i give sentenc against
them

4:13 behold he shall come up as cloud and hi chariot shall be as
a whirlwind: hi hors are swifter than eagl woe unto us! for we
are spoil

4:14 o jerusalem wash thine heart from wicked that thou mayest
be save how long shall thi vain thought lodg within thee? 4:15
for a voic declareth from dan and publisheth afflict from mount
ephraim

4:16 make ye mention to the nations; behold publish against
jerusalem that watcher come from a far countri and give out their
voic against the citi of judah

4:17 as keeper of a field are they against her round about; becaus
she hath been rebelli against me saith the lord

4:18 thi way and thi do have procur these thing unto thee; thi
is thi wicked becaus it is bitter becaus it reacheth unto
thine heart

4:19 my bowel my bowels! i am pain at my veri heart; my heart
maketh a nois in me; i cannot hold my peac becaus thou hast heard
o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war

4:20 destruct upon destruct is cried; for the whole land is
spoiled: suddenli are my tent spoil and my curtain in a moment

4:21 how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the
trumpet? 4:22 for my peopl is foolish they have not known me; they
are sottish children and they have none understanding: they are wise
to do evil but to do good they have no knowledg

4:23 i beheld the earth and lo it wa without form and void; and
the heaven and they had no light

4:24 i beheld the mountain and lo they trembl and all the hill
move lightli

4:25 i beheld and lo there wa no man and all the bird of the
heaven were fled

4:26 i beheld and lo the fruit place wa a wilder and all
the citi thereof were broken down at the presenc of the lord and
by hi fierc anger

4:27 for thu hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate;
yet will i not make a full end

4:28 for thi shall the earth mourn and the heaven abov be black;
becaus i have spoken it i have purpos it and will not repent
neither will i turn back from it

4:29 the whole citi shall flee for the nois of the horsemen and
bowmen; they shall go into thicket and climb up upon the rocks:
everi citi shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein

4:30 and when thou art spoil what wilt thou do? though thou
clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornament
of gold though thou rentest thi face with paint in vain shalt
thou make thyself fair; thi lover will despis thee they will seek
thi life

4:31 for i have heard a voic as of a woman in travail and the
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voic of
the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her
hand say woe is me now! for my soul is weari becaus of
murder

5:1 run ye to and fro through the street of jerusalem and see now
and know and seek in the broad place thereof if ye can find a man
if there be ani that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth; and i
will pardon it

5:2 and though they say the lord liveth; sure they swear fals

5:3 o lord are not thine eye upon the truth? thou hast stricken
them but they have not grieved; thou hast consum them but they
have refus to receiv correction: they have made their face harder
than a rock; they have refus to return

5:4 therefor i said sure these are poor; they are foolish: for
they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god

5:5 i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them; for
they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god:
but these have altogeth broken the yoke and burst the bond

5:6 wherefor a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of
the even shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their
cities: everi one that goeth out thenc shall be torn in pieces:
becaus their transgress are mani and their backslid are
increas

5:7 how shall i pardon thee for this? thi children have forsaken me
and sworn by them that are no gods: when i had fed them to the full
they then commit adulteri and assembl themselv by troop in
the harlot hous

5:8 they were as fed hors in the morning: everi one neigh after
hi neighbour wife

5:9 shall i not visit for these things? saith the lord: and shall not
my soul be aveng on such a nation as this? 5:10 go ye up upon her
wall and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her
battlements; for they are not the lord

5:11 for the hous of israel and the hous of judah have dealt veri
treacher against me saith the lord

5:12 they have beli the lord and said it is not he; neither shall
evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 5:13 and the
prophet shall becom wind and the word is not in them: thu shall it
be done unto them

5:14 wherefor thu saith the lord god of host becaus ye speak thi
word behold i will make my word in thi mouth fire and thi peopl
wood and it shall devour them

5:15 lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o hous of israel
saith the lord: it is a mighti nation it is an ancient nation a
nation whose languag thou knowest not neither understandest what
they say

5:16 their quiver is as an open sepulchr they are all mighti men

5:17 and they shall eat up thine harvest and thi bread which thi
son and thi daughter should eat: they shall eat up thi flock and
thine herds: they shall eat up thi vine and thi fig trees: they shall
impoverish thi fenc citi wherein thou trustedst with the sword

5:18 nevertheless in those day saith the lord i will not make a
full end with you

5:19 and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefor doeth the
lord our god all these thing unto us? then shalt thou answer them
like as ye have forsaken me and serv strang god in your land so
shall ye serv stranger in a land that is not your

5:20 declar thi in the hous of jacob and publish it in judah
say 5:21 hear now thi o foolish peopl and without
understanding; which have eye and see not; which have ear and hear
not: 5:22 fear ye not me? saith the lord: will ye not trembl at my
presenc which have place the sand for the bound of the sea by a
perpetu decre that it cannot pass it: and though the wave thereof
toss themselv yet can they not prevail; though they roar yet can
they not pass over it? 5:23 but thi peopl hath a revolt and a
rebelli heart; they are revolt and gone

5:24 neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our
god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in hi season:
he reserveth unto us the appoint week of the harvest

5:25 your iniqu have turn away these thing and your sin have
withholden good thing from you

5:26 for among my peopl are found wick men: they lay wait as he
that setteth snares; they set a trap they catch men

5:27 as a cage is full of bird so are their hous full of deceit:
therefor they are becom great and waxen rich

5:28 they are waxen fat they shine: yea they overpass the deed of
the wicked: they judg not the caus the caus of the fatherless yet
they prosper; and the right of the needi do they not judg

5:29 shall i not visit for these things? saith the lord: shall not my
soul be aveng on such a nation as this? 5:30 a wonder and
horribl thing is commit in the land; 5:31 the prophet prophesi
fals and the priest bear rule by their means; and my peopl love
to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? 6:1 o ye
children of benjamin gather yourselv to flee out of the midst of
jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in
bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north and great
destruct

6:2 i have liken the daughter of zion to a come and delic
woman

6:3 the shepherd with their flock shall come unto her; they shall
pitch their tent against her round about; they shall feed everi one
in hi place

6:4 prepar ye war against her; aris and let us go up at noon woe
unto us! for the day goeth away for the shadow of the even are
stretch out

6:5 aris and let us go by night and let us destroy her palac

6:6 for thu hath the lord of host said hew ye down tree and cast
a mount against jerusalem: thi is the citi to be visited; she is
wholli oppress in the midst of her

6:7 as a fountain casteth out her water so she casteth out her
wickedness: violenc and spoil is heard in her; befor me continu
is grief and wound

6:8 be thou instruct o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee;
lest i make thee desol a land not inhabit

6:9 thu saith the lord of host they shall throughli glean the
remnant of israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegather
into the basket

6:10 to whom shall i speak and give warn that they may hear?
behold their ear is uncircumcis and they cannot hearken: behold
the word of the lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in
it

6:11 therefor i am full of the furi of the lord; i am weari with
hold in: i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the
assembl of young men together: for even the husband with the wife
shall be taken the age with him that is full of day

6:12 and their hous shall be turn unto other with their field
and wive together: for i will stretch out my hand upon the
inhabit of the land saith the lord

6:13 for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everi
one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the
priest everi one dealeth fals

6:14 they have heal also the hurt of the daughter of my peopl
slightli say peac peace; when there is no peac

6:15 were they asham when they had commit abomination? nay they
were not at all asham neither could they blush: therefor they
shall fall among them that fall: at the time that i visit them they
shall be cast down saith the lord

6:16 thu saith the lord stand ye in the way and see and ask for
the old path where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall
find rest for your soul but they said we will not walk therein

6:17 also i set watchmen over you say hearken to the sound of the
trumpet but they said we will not hearken

6:18 therefor hear ye nation and know o congreg what is
among them

6:19 hear o earth: behold i will bring evil upon thi peopl even
the fruit of their thought becaus they have not hearken unto my
word nor to my law but reject it

6:20 to what purpos cometh there to me incens from sheba and the
sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offer are not
accept nor your sacrific sweet unto me

6:21 therefor thu saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblock
befor thi peopl and the father and the son togeth shall fall
upon them; the neighbour and hi friend shall perish

6:22 thu saith the lord behold a peopl cometh from the north
countri and a great nation shall be rais from the side of the
earth

6:23 they shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel and have no
mercy; their voic roareth like the sea; and they ride upon hors
set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion

6:24 we have heard the fame thereof: our hand wax feeble: anguish
hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail

6:25 go not forth into the field nor walk by the way; for the sword
of the enemi and fear is on everi side

6:26 o daughter of my peopl gird thee with sackcloth and wallow
thyself in ashes: make thee mourn as for an onli son most bitter
lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenli come upon us

6:27 i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my peopl that
thou mayest know and tri their way

6:28 they are all grievou revolt walk with slanders: they are
brass and iron; they are all corrupt

6:29 the bellow are burn the lead is consum of the fire; the
founder melteth in vain: for the wick are not pluck away

6:30 reprob silver shall men call them becaus the lord hath
reject them

7:1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord say 7:2 stand in
the gate of the lord hous and proclaim there thi word and say
hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these
gate to worship the lord

7:3 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel amend your way
and your do and i will caus you to dwell in thi place

7:4 trust ye not in lie word say the templ of the lord the
templ of the lord the templ of the lord are these

7:5 for if ye throughli amend your way and your doings; if ye
throughli execut judgment between a man and hi neighbour; 7:6 if ye
oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not
innoc blood in thi place neither walk after other god to your
hurt: 7:7 then will i caus you to dwell in thi place in the land
that i gave to your father for ever and ever

7:8 behold ye trust in lie word that cannot profit

7:9 will ye steal murder and commit adulteri and swear fals and
burn incens unto baal and walk after other god whom ye know not;
7:10 and come and stand befor me in thi hous which is call by my
name and say we are deliv to do all these abominations? 7:11 is
thi hous which is call by my name becom a den of robber in
your eyes? behold even i have seen it saith the lord

7:12 but go ye now unto my place which wa in shiloh where i set my
name at the first and see what i did to it for the wicked of my
peopl israel

7:13 and now becaus ye have done all these work saith the lord
and i spake unto you rise up earli and speak but ye heard not;
and i call you but ye answer not; 7:14 therefor will i do unto
thi hous which is call by my name wherein ye trust and unto the
place which i gave to you and to your father as i have done to
shiloh

7:15 and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your
brethren even the whole seed of ephraim

7:16 therefor pray not thou for thi peopl neither lift up cri nor
prayer for them neither make intercess to me: for i will not hear
thee

7:17 seest thou not what they do in the citi of judah and in the
street of jerusalem? 7:18 the children gather wood and the father
kindl the fire and the women knead their dough to make cake to the
queen of heaven and to pour out drink offer unto other god that
they may provok me to anger

7:19 do they provok me to anger? saith the lord: do they not provok
themselv to the confus of their own faces? 7:20 therefor thu
saith the lord god; behold mine anger and my furi shall be pour out
upon thi place upon man and upon beast and upon the tree of the
field and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn and shall
not be quench

7:21 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; put your burnt
offer unto your sacrific and eat flesh

7:22 for i spake not unto your father nor command them in the day
that i brought them out of the land of egypt concern burnt
offer or sacrifices: 7:23 but thi thing command i them say
obey my voic and i will be your god and ye shall be my people: and
walk ye in all the way that i have command you that it may be well
unto you

7:24 but they hearken not nor inclin their ear but walk in the
counsel and in the imagin of their evil heart and went
backward and not forward

7:25 sinc the day that your father came forth out of the land of
egypt unto thi day i have even sent unto you all my servant the
prophet daili rise up earli and send them: 7:26 yet they
hearken not unto me nor inclin their ear but harden their
neck: they did wors than their father

7:27 therefor thou shalt speak all these word unto them; but they
will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they
will not answer thee

7:28 but thou shalt say unto them thi is a nation that obeyeth not
the voic of the lord their god nor receiveth correction: truth is
perish and is cut off from their mouth

7:29 cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a
lament on high places; for the lord hath reject and forsaken
the gener of hi wrath

7:30 for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the
lord: they have set their abomin in the hous which is call by
my name to pollut it

7:31 and they have built the high place of tophet which is in the
valley of the son of hinnom to burn their son and their daughter in
the fire; which i command them not neither came it into my heart

7:32 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that it shall
no more be call tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the
valley of slaughter: for they shall buri in tophet till there be no
place

7:33 and the carcas of thi peopl shall be meat for the fowl of
the heaven and for the beast of the earth; and none shall fray them
away

7:34 then will i caus to ceas from the citi of judah and from the
street of jerusalem the voic of mirth and the voic of glad
the voic of the bridegroom and the voic of the bride: for the land
shall be desol

8:1 at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bone of
the king of judah and the bone of hi princ and the bone of the
priest and the bone of the prophet and the bone of the
inhabit of jerusalem out of their graves: 8:2 and they shall
spread them befor the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven
whom they have love and whom they have serv and after whom they
have walk and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped:
they shall not be gather nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon
the face of the earth

8:3 and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residu of
them that remain of thi evil famili which remain in all the place
whither i have driven them saith the lord of host

8:4 moreov thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord; shall they
fall and not arise? shall he turn away and not return? 8:5 whi then
is thi peopl of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetu backsliding?
they hold fast deceit they refus to return

8:6 i hearken and heard but they spake not aright: no man repent
him of hi wicked say what have i done? everi one turn to
hi cours as the hors rusheth into the battl

8:7 yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appoint times; and the
turtl and the crane and the swallow observ the time of their coming;
but my peopl know not the judgment of the lord

8:8 how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us?
lo certainli in vain made he it; the pen of the scribe is in vain

8:9 the wise men are asham they are dismay and taken: lo they
have reject the word of the lord; and what wisdom is in them? 8:10
therefor will i give their wive unto other and their field to
them that shall inherit them: for everi one from the least even unto
the greatest is given to covet from the prophet even unto the
priest everi one dealeth fals

8:11 for they have heal the hurt of the daughter of my peopl
slightli say peac peace; when there is no peac

8:12 were they asham when they had commit abomination? nay they
were not at all asham neither could they blush: therefor shall
they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visit they
shall be cast down saith the lord

8:13 i will sure consum them saith the lord: there shall be no
grape on the vine nor fig on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade;
and the thing that i have given them shall pass away from them

8:14 whi do we sit still? assembl yourselv and let us enter into
the defenc citi and let us be silent there: for the lord our god
hath put us to silenc and given us water of gall to drink becaus
we have sin against the lord

8:15 we look for peac but no good came; and for a time of health
and behold trouble! 8:16 the snort of hi hors wa heard from
dan: the whole land trembl at the sound of the neigh of hi
strong ones; for they are come and have devour the land and all
that is in it; the citi and those that dwell therein

8:17 for behold i will send serpent cockatric among you which
will not be charm and they shall bite you saith the lord

8:18 when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in
me

8:19 behold the voic of the cri of the daughter of my peopl becaus
of them that dwell in a far country: is not the lord in zion? is not
her king in her? whi have they provok me to anger with their graven
imag and with strang vanities? 8:20 the harvest is past the
summer is end and we are not save

8:21 for the hurt of the daughter of my peopl am i hurt; i am black;
astonish hath taken hold on me

8:22 is there no balm in gilead; is there no physician there? whi then
is not the health of the daughter of my peopl recovered? 9:1 oh that
my head were water and mine eye a fountain of tear that i might
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 9:2 oh
that i had in the wilder a lodg place of wayfar men; that i
might leav my peopl and go from them! for they be all adulter
an assembl of treacher men

9:3 and they bend their tongu like their bow for lies: but they are
not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil
to evil and they know not me saith the lord

9:4 take ye heed everi one of hi neighbour and trust ye not in ani
brother: for everi brother will utterli supplant and everi neighbour
will walk with slander

9:5 and they will deceiv everi one hi neighbour and will not speak
the truth: they have taught their tongu to speak lie and weari
themselv to commit iniqu

9:6 thine habit is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
refus to know me saith the lord

9:7 therefor thu saith the lord of host behold i will melt them
and tri them; for how shall i do for the daughter of my people? 9:8
their tongu is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh
peaceabl to hi neighbour with hi mouth but in heart he layeth hi
wait

9:9 shall i not visit them for these things? saith the lord: shall not
my soul be aveng on such a nation as this? 9:10 for the mountain
will i take up a weep and wail and for the habit of the
wilder a lament becaus they are burn up so that none can
pass through them; neither can men hear the voic of the cattle; both
the fowl of the heaven and the beast are fled; they are gone

9:11 and i will make jerusalem heap and a den of dragons; and i will
make the citi of judah desol without an inhabit

9:12 who is the wise man that may understand this? and who is he to
whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declar it for
what the land perisheth and is burn up like a wilder that none
passeth through? 9:13 and the lord saith becaus they have forsaken
my law which i set befor them and have not obey my voic neither
walk therein; 9:14 but have walk after the imagin of their
own heart and after baalim which their father taught them: 9:15
therefor thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; behold i
will feed them even thi peopl with wormwood and give them water
of gall to drink

9:16 i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor
their father have known: and i will send a sword after them till i
have consum them

9:17 thu saith the lord of host consid ye and call for the
mourn women that they may come; and send for cun women that
they may come: 9:18 and let them make hast and take up a wail for
us that our eye may run down with tear and our eyelid gush out
with water

9:19 for a voic of wail is heard out of zion how are we spoiled!
we are greatli confound becaus we have forsaken the land becaus
our dwell have cast us out

9:20 yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear
receiv the word of hi mouth and teach your daughter wail and
everi one her neighbour lament

9:21 for death is come up into our window and is enter into our
palac to cut off the children from without and the young men from
the street

9:22 speak thu saith the lord even the carcas of men shall fall
as dung upon the open field and as the hand after the harvestman
and none shall gather them

9:23 thu saith the lord let not the wise man glori in hi wisdom
neither let the mighti man glori in hi might let not the rich man
glori in hi riches: 9:24 but let him that glorieth glori in thi
that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which
exercis lovingkind judgment and righteous in the earth:
for in these thing i delight saith the lord

9:25 behold the day come saith the lord that i will punish all
them which are circumcis with the uncircumcised; 9:26 egypt and
judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are
in the utmost corner that dwell in the wilderness: for all these
nation are uncircumcis and all the hous of israel are
uncircumcis in the heart

10:1 hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o hous of
israel: 10:2 thu saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen
and be not dismay at the sign of heaven; for the heathen are
dismay at them

10:3 for the custom of the peopl are vain: for one cutteth a tree
out of the forest the work of the hand of the workman with the axe

10:4 they deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nail
and with hammer that it move not

10:5 they are upright as the palm tree but speak not: they must need
be born becaus they cannot go be not afraid of them; for they
cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good

10:6 forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord; thou art
great and thi name is great in might

10:7 who would not fear thee o king of nations? for to thee doth it
appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nation and in
all their kingdom there is none like unto thee

10:8 but they are altogeth brutish and foolish: the stock is a
doctrin of vaniti

10:9 silver spread into plate is brought from tarshish and gold from
uphaz the work of the workman and of the hand of the founder: blue
and purpl is their clothing: they are all the work of cun men

10:10 but the lord is the true god he is the live god and an
everlast king: at hi wrath the earth shall trembl and the
nation shall not be abl to abid hi indign

10:11 thu shall ye say unto them the god that have not made the
heaven and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from
under these heaven

10:12 he hath made the earth by hi power he hath establish the
world by hi wisdom and hath stretch out the heaven by hi
discret

10:13 when he uttereth hi voic there is a multitud of water in
the heaven and he causeth the vapour to ascend from the end of the
earth; he maketh lightn with rain and bringeth forth the wind out
of hi treasur

10:14 everi man is brutish in hi knowledge: everi founder is
confound by the graven image: for hi molten imag is falsehood and
there is no breath in them

10:15 they are vaniti and the work of errors: in the time of their
visit they shall perish

10:16 the portion of jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
all things; and israel is the rod of hi inheritance: the lord of
host is hi name

10:17 gather up thi ware out of the land o inhabit of the
fortress

10:18 for thu saith the lord behold i will sling out the
inhabit of the land at thi onc and will distress them that
they may find it so

10:19 woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but i said truli
thi is a grief and i must bear it

10:20 my tabernacl is spoil and all my cord are broken: my
children are gone forth of me and they are not: there is none to
stretch forth my tent ani more and to set up my curtain

10:21 for the pastor are becom brutish and have not sought the
lord: therefor they shall not prosper and all their flock shall be
scatter

10:22 behold the nois of the bruit is come and a great commot
out of the north countri to make the citi of judah desol and a
den of dragon

10:23 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not
in man that walketh to direct hi step

10:24 o lord correct me but with judgment; not in thine anger lest
thou bring me to noth

10:25 pour out thi furi upon the heathen that know thee not and upon
the famili that call not on thi name: for they have eaten up jacob
and devour him and consum him and have made hi habit
desol

11:1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord say 11:2 hear ye
the word of thi coven and speak unto the men of judah and to
the inhabit of jerusalem; 11:3 and say thou unto them thu saith
the lord god of israel; curs be the man that obeyeth not the word
of thi coven 11:4 which i command your father in the day that
i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnac
say obey my voic and do them accord to all which i command
you: so shall ye be my peopl and i will be your god: 11:5 that i may
perform the oath which i have sworn unto your father to give them a
land flow with milk and honey as it is thi day then answer i
and said so be it o lord

11:6 then the lord said unto me proclaim all these word in the
citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem say hear ye the
word of thi coven and do them

11:7 for i earnestli protest unto your father in the day that i
brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto thi day rise
earli and protest say obey my voic

11:8 yet they obey not nor inclin their ear but walk everi one
in the imagin of their evil heart: therefor i will bring upon
them all the word of thi coven which i command them to do: but
they did them not

11:9 and the lord said unto me a conspiraci is found among the men of
judah and among the inhabit of jerusalem

11:10 they are turn back to the iniqu of their forefath
which refus to hear my words; and they went after other god to
serv them: the hous of israel and the hous of judah have broken my
coven which i made with their father

11:11 therefor thu saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon
them which they shall not be abl to escape; and though they shall
cri unto me i will not hearken unto them

11:12 then shall the citi of judah and inhabit of jerusalem go
and cri unto the god unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not
save them at all in the time of their troubl

11:13 for accord to the number of thi citi were thi god o
judah; and accord to the number of the street of jerusalem have ye
set up altar to that shame thing even altar to burn incens unto
baal

11:14 therefor pray not thou for thi peopl neither lift up a cri
or prayer for them: for i will not hear them in the time that they cri
unto me for their troubl

11:15 what hath my belov to do in mine hous see she hath
wrought lewd with mani and the holi flesh is pass from thee?
when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest

11:16 the lord call thi name a green oliv tree fair and of
goodli fruit: with the nois of a great tumult he hath kindl fire
upon it and the branch of it are broken

11:17 for the lord of host that plant thee hath pronounc evil
against thee for the evil of the hous of israel and of the hous of
judah which they have done against themselv to provok me to anger
in offer incens unto baal

11:18 and the lord hath given me knowledg of it and i know it: then
thou shewedst me their do

11:19 but i wa like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter;
and i knew not that they had devis devic against me say let
us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off
from the land of the live that hi name may be no more rememb

11:20 but o lord of host that judgest righteous that triest the
rein and the heart let me see thi vengeanc on them: for unto thee
have i reveal my caus

11:21 therefor thu saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek
thi life say prophesi not in the name of the lord that thou die
not by our hand: 11:22 therefor thu saith the lord of host behold
i will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their son
and their daughter shall die by famine: 11:23 and there shall be no
remnant of them: for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even
the year of their visit

12:1 righteou art thou o lord when i plead with thee: yet let me
talk with thee of thi judgments: wherefor doth the way of the wick
prosper? wherefor are all they happi that deal veri treacherously?
12:2 thou hast plant them yea they have taken root: they grow
yea they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth and far
from their rein

12:3 but thou o lord knowest me: thou hast seen me and tri mine
heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and
prepar them for the day of slaughter

12:4 how long shall the land mourn and the herb of everi field
wither for the wicked of them that dwell therein? the beast are
consum and the birds; becaus they said he shall not see our last
end

12:5 if thou hast run with the footmen and they have weari thee
then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peac
wherein thou trustedst they weari thee then how wilt thou do in
the swell of jordan? 12:6 for even thi brethren and the hous of
thi father even they have dealt treacher with thee; yea they
have call a multitud after thee: believ them not though they
speak fair word unto thee

12:7 i have forsaken mine hous i have left mine heritage; i have
given the dearli belov of my soul into the hand of her enemi

12:8 mine heritag is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out
against me: therefor have i hate it

12:9 mine heritag is unto me as a speckl bird the bird round
about are against her; come ye assembl all the beast of the field
come to devour

12:10 mani pastor have destroy my vineyard they have trodden my
portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desol
wilder

12:11 they have made it desol and be desol it mourneth unto
me; the whole land is made desol becaus no man layeth it to
heart

12:12 the spoiler are come upon all high place through the
wilderness: for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of
the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peac

12:13 they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns: they have put
themselv to pain but shall not profit: and they shall be asham of
your revenu becaus of the fierc anger of the lord

12:14 thu saith the lord against all mine evil neighbour that touch
the inherit which i have caus my peopl israel to inherit;
behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the hous
of judah from among them

12:15 and it shall come to pass after that i have pluck them out i
will return and have compass on them and will bring them again
everi man to hi heritag and everi man to hi land

12:16 and it shall come to pass if they will dilig learn the
way of my peopl to swear by my name the lord liveth; as they
taught my peopl to swear by baal; then shall they be built in the
midst of my peopl

12:17 but if they will not obey i will utterli pluck up and destroy
that nation saith the lord

13:1 thu saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdl and
put it upon thi loin and put it not in water

13:2 so i got a girdl accord to the word of the lord and put it
on my loin

13:3 and the word of the lord came unto me the second time say
13:4 take the girdl that thou hast got which is upon thi loin and
aris go to euphrat and hide it there in a hole of the rock

13:5 so i went and hid it by euphrat as the lord command me

13:6 and it came to pass after mani day that the lord said unto me
aris go to euphrat and take the girdl from thenc which i
command thee to hide there

13:7 then i went to euphrat and dig and took the girdl from
the place where i had hid it: and behold the girdl wa mar it
wa profit for noth

13:8 then the word of the lord came unto me say 13:9 thu saith
the lord after thi manner will i mar the pride of judah and the
great pride of jerusalem

13:10 thi evil peopl which refus to hear my word which walk in
the imagin of their heart and walk after other god to serv
them and to worship them shall even be as thi girdl which is good
for noth

13:11 for as the girdl cleaveth to the loin of a man so have i
caus to cleav unto me the whole hous of israel and the whole hous
of judah saith the lord; that they might be unto me for a peopl and
for a name and for a prais and for a glory: but they would not
hear

13:12 therefor thou shalt speak unto them thi word; thu saith the
lord god of israel everi bottl shall be fill with wine: and they
shall say unto thee do we not certainli know that everi bottl shall
be fill with wine? 13:13 then shalt thou say unto them thu saith
the lord behold i will fill all the inhabit of thi land even
the king that sit upon david throne and the priest and the
prophet and all the inhabit of jerusalem with drunken

13:14 and i will dash them one against anoth even the father and
the son togeth saith the lord: i will not piti nor spare nor
have merci but destroy them

13:15 hear ye and give ear; be not proud: for the lord hath spoken

13:16 give glori to the lord your god befor he caus dark and
befor your feet stumbl upon the dark mountain and while ye look
for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross
dark

13:17 but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret place
for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tear
becaus the lord flock is carri away captiv

13:18 say unto the king and to the queen humbl yourselv sit down:
for your princip shall come down even the crown of your glori

13:19 the citi of the south shall be shut up and none shall open
them: judah shall be carri away captiv all of it it shall be
wholli carri away captiv

13:20 lift up your eye and behold them that come from the north:
where is the flock that wa given thee thi beauti flock? 13:21
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught
them to be captain and as chief over thee: shall not sorrow take
thee as a woman in travail? 13:22 and if thou say in thine heart
wherefor come these thing upon me? for the great of thine
iniqu are thi skirt discov and thi heel made bare

13:23 can the ethiopian chang hi skin or the leopard hi spots?
then may ye also do good that are accustom to do evil

13:24 therefor will i scatter them as the stubbl that passeth away
by the wind of the wilder

13:25 thi is thi lot the portion of thi measur from me saith the
lord; becaus thou hast forgotten me and trust in falsehood

13:26 therefor will i discov thi skirt upon thi face that thi
shame may appear

13:27 i have seen thine adulteri and thi neigh the lewd of
thi whoredom and thine abomin on the hill in the field woe
unto thee o jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it
onc be? 14:1 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concern
the dearth

14:2 judah mourneth and the gate thereof languish; they are black
unto the ground; and the cri of jerusalem is gone up

14:3 and their nobl have sent their littl one to the waters: they
came to the pit and found no water; they return with their vessel
empty; they were asham and confound and cover their head

14:4 becaus the ground is chapt for there wa no rain in the earth
the plowmen were asham they cover their head

14:5 yea the hind also calv in the field and forsook it becaus
there wa no grass

14:6 and the wild ass did stand in the high place they snuf up
the wind like dragons; their eye did fail becaus there wa no
grass

14:7 o lord though our iniqu testifi against us do thou it for
thi name sake: for our backslid are many; we have sin against
thee

14:8 o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of troubl whi
shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfar man
that turneth asid to tarri for a night? 14:9 whi shouldest thou be
as a man astoni as a mighti man that cannot save? yet thou o lord
art in the midst of us and we are call by thi name; leav us not

14:10 thu saith the lord unto thi peopl thu have they love to
wander they have not refrain their feet therefor the lord doth
not accept them; he will now rememb their iniqu and visit their
sin

14:11 then said the lord unto me pray not for thi peopl for their
good

14:12 when they fast i will not hear their cry; and when they offer
burnt offer and an oblat i will not accept them: but i will
consum them by the sword and by the famin and by the pestil

14:13 then said i ah lord god! behold the prophet say unto them
ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine; but i will
give you assur peac in thi place

14:14 then the lord said unto me the prophet prophesi lie in my
name: i sent them not neither have i command them neither spake
unto them: they prophesi unto you a fals vision and divin and a
thing of nought and the deceit of their heart

14:15 therefor thu saith the lord concern the prophet that
prophesi in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and
famin shall not be in thi land; by sword and famin shall those
prophet be consum

14:16 and the peopl to whom they prophesi shall be cast out in the
street of jerusalem becaus of the famin and the sword; and they
shall have none to buri them them their wive nor their son nor
their daughters: for i will pour their wicked upon them

14:17 therefor thou shalt say thi word unto them; let mine eye run
down with tear night and day and let them not cease: for the virgin
daughter of my peopl is broken with a great breach with a veri
grievou blow

14:18 if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the
sword! and if i enter into the citi then behold them that are sick
with famine! yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a
land that they know not

14:19 hast thou utterli reject judah? hath thi soul loth zion? whi
hast thou smitten us and there is no heal for us? we look for
peac and there is no good; and for the time of heal and behold
trouble! 14:20 we acknowledg o lord our wicked and the
iniqu of our fathers: for we have sin against thee

14:21 do not abhor us for thi name sake do not disgrac the throne
of thi glory: rememb break not thi coven with us

14:22 are there ani among the vaniti of the gentil that can caus
rain? or can the heaven give showers? art not thou he o lord our
god? therefor we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these
thing

15:1 then said the lord unto me though mose and samuel stood befor
me yet my mind could not be toward thi people: cast them out of my
sight and let them go forth

15:2 and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall
we go forth? then thou shalt tell them thu saith the lord; such as
are for death to death; and such as are for the sword to the sword;
and such as are for the famin to the famine; and such as are for the
captiv to the captiv

15:3 and i will appoint over them four kind saith the lord: the
sword to slay and the dog to tear and the fowl of the heaven and
the beast of the earth to devour and destroy

15:4 and i will caus them to be remov into all kingdom of the
earth becaus of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that
which he did in jerusalem

15:5 for who shall have piti upon thee o jerusalem? or who shall
bemoan thee? or who shall go asid to ask how thou doest? 15:6 thou
hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward: therefor
will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee; i am weari
with repent

15:7 and i will fan them with a fan in the gate of the land; i will
bereav them of children i will destroy my peopl sinc they return
not from their way

15:8 their widow are increas to me abov the sand of the seas: i
have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler
at noonday: i have caus him to fall upon it suddenli and terror
upon the citi

15:9 she that hath born seven languisheth: she hath given up the
ghost; her sun is gone down while it wa yet day: she hath been
asham and confounded: and the residu of them will i deliv to the
sword befor their enemi saith the lord

15:10 woe is me my mother that thou hast born me a man of strife
and a man of content to the whole earth! i have neither lent on
usuri nor men have lent to me on usury; yet everi one of them doth
curs me

15:11 the lord said verili it shall be well with thi remnant; verili
i will caus the enemi to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in
the time of afflict

15:12 shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 15:13 thi
substanc and thi treasur will i give to the spoil without price
and that for all thi sin even in all thi border

15:14 and i will make thee to pass with thine enemi into a land
which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindl in mine anger which
shall burn upon you

15:15 o lord thou knowest: rememb me and visit me and reveng me
of my persecutors; take me not away in thi longsuffering: know that
for thi sake i have suffer rebuk

15:16 thi word were found and i did eat them; and thi word wa unto
me the joy and rejoic of mine heart: for i am call by thi name o
lord god of host

15:17 i sat not in the assembl of the mocker nor rejoiced; i sat
alon becaus of thi hand: for thou hast fill me with indign

15:18 whi is my pain perpetu and my wound incur which refuseth
to be healed? wilt thou be altogeth unto me as a liar and as water
that fail? 15:19 therefor thu saith the lord if thou return then
will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand befor me: and if thou
take forth the preciou from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth: let
them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them

15:20 and i will make thee unto thi peopl a fenc brasen wall: and
they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against
thee: for i am with thee to save thee and to deliv thee saith the
lord

15:21 and i will deliv thee out of the hand of the wick and i
will redeem thee out of the hand of the terribl

16:1 the word of the lord came also unto me say 16:2 thou shalt
not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have son or daughter in
thi place

16:3 for thu saith the lord concern the son and concern the
daughter that are born in thi place and concern their mother
that bare them and concern their father that begat them in thi
land; 16:4 they shall die of grievou deaths; they shall not be
lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon
the face of the earth: and they shall be consum by the sword and by
famine; and their carcas shall be meat for the fowl of heaven and
for the beast of the earth

16:5 for thu saith the lord enter not into the hous of mourn
neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for i have taken away my peac
from thi peopl saith the lord even lovingkind and merci

16:6 both the great and the small shall die in thi land: they shall
not be buri neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselv
nor make themselv bald for them: 16:7 neither shall men tear
themselv for them in mourn to comfort them for the dead; neither
shall men give them the cup of consol to drink for their father
or for their mother

16:8 thou shalt not also go into the hous of feast to sit with
them to eat and to drink

16:9 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; behold i
will caus to ceas out of thi place in your eye and in your day
the voic of mirth and the voic of glad the voic of the
bridegroom and the voic of the bride

16:10 and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew thi peopl all
these word and they shall say unto thee wherefor hath the lord
pronounc all thi great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or
what is our sin that we have commit against the lord our god?
16:11 then shalt thou say unto them becaus your father have
forsaken me saith the lord and have walk after other god and
have serv them and have worship them and have forsaken me and
have not kept my law; 16:12 and ye have done wors than your fathers;
for behold ye walk everi one after the imagin of hi evil
heart that they may not hearken unto me: 16:13 therefor will i cast
you out of thi land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your
fathers; and there shall ye serv other god day and night; where i
will not shew you favour

16:14 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that it shall
no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of
israel out of the land of egypt; 16:15 but the lord liveth that
brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from
all the land whither he had driven them: and i will bring them again
into their land that i gave unto their father

16:16 behold i will send for mani fisher saith the lord and they
shall fish them; and after will i send for mani hunter and they
shall hunt them from everi mountain and from everi hill and out of
the hole of the rock

16:17 for mine eye are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
face neither is their iniqu hid from mine eye

16:18 and first i will recompens their iniqu and their sin double;
becaus they have defil my land they have fill mine inherit
with the carcas of their detest and abomin thing

16:19 o lord my strength and my fortress and my refug in the day
of afflict the gentil shall come unto thee from the end of the
earth and shall say sure our father have inherit lie vaniti
and thing wherein there is no profit

16:20 shall a man make god unto himself and they are no gods? 16:21
therefor behold i will thi onc caus them to know i will caus
them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name
is the lord

17:1 the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the
point of a diamond: it is graven upon the tabl of their heart and
upon the horn of your altars; 17:2 whilst their children rememb
their altar and their grove by the green tree upon the high hill

17:3 o my mountain in the field i will give thi substanc and all thi
treasur to the spoil and thi high place for sin throughout all
thi border

17:4 and thou even thyself shalt discontinu from thine heritag
that i gave thee; and i will caus thee to serv thine enemi in the
land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindl a fire in mine anger
which shall burn for ever

17:5 thu saith the lord; curs be the man that trusteth in man and
maketh flesh hi arm and whose heart departeth from the lord

17:6 for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see
when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parch place in the
wilder in a salt land and not inhabit

17:7 bless is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the
lord is

17:8 for he shall be as a tree plant by the water and that
spreadeth out her root by the river and shall not see when heat
cometh but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be care in the
year of drought neither shall ceas from yield fruit

17:9 the heart is deceit abov all thing and desper wicked:
who can know it? 17:10 i the lord search the heart i tri the rein
even to give everi man accord to hi way and accord to the
fruit of hi do

17:11 as the partridg sitteth on egg and hatcheth them not; so he
that getteth rich and not by right shall leav them in the midst
of hi day and at hi end shall be a fool

17:12 a gloriou high throne from the begin is the place of our
sanctuari

17:13 o lord the hope of israel all that forsak thee shall be
asham and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth
becaus they have forsaken the lord the fountain of live water

17:14 heal me o lord and i shall be healed; save me and i shall be
saved: for thou art my prais

17:15 behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord? let it
come now

17:16 as for me i have not hasten from be a pastor to follow
thee: neither have i desir the woeful day; thou knowest: that which
came out of my lip wa right befor thee

17:17 be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil

17:18 let them be confound that persecut me but let not me be
confounded: let them be dismay but let not me be dismayed: bring
upon them the day of evil and destroy them with doubl destruct

17:19 thu said the lord unto me; go and stand in the gate of the
children of the peopl wherebi the king of judah come in and by the
which they go out and in all the gate of jerusalem; 17:20 and say
unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye king of judah and all
judah and all the inhabit of jerusalem that enter in by these
gates: 17:21 thu saith the lord; take heed to yourselv and bear no
burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gate of jerusalem;
17:22 neither carri forth a burden out of your hous on the sabbath
day neither do ye ani work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i
command your father

17:23 but they obey not neither inclin their ear but made their
neck stiff that they might not hear nor receiv instruct

17:24 and it shall come to pass if ye dilig hearken unto me
saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gate of thi citi
on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein;
17:25 then shall there enter into the gate of thi citi king and
princ sit upon the throne of david ride in chariot and on
hors they and their princ the men of judah and the inhabit
of jerusalem: and thi citi shall remain for ever

17:26 and they shall come from the citi of judah and from the
place about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the
plain and from the mountain and from the south bring burnt
offer and sacrific and meat offer and incens and
bring sacrific of prais unto the hous of the lord

17:27 but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day
and not to bear a burden even enter in at the gate of jerusalem
on the sabbath day; then will i kindl a fire in the gate thereof
and it shall devour the palac of jerusalem and it shall not be
quench

18:1 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord say 18:2
aris and go down to the potter hous and there i will caus thee
to hear my word

18:3 then i went down to the potter hous and behold he wrought a
work on the wheel

18:4 and the vessel that he made of clay wa mar in the hand of the
potter: so he made it again anoth vessel as seem good to the
potter to make it

18:5 then the word of the lord came to me say 18:6 o hous of
israel cannot i do with you as thi potter? saith the lord behold
as the clay is in the potter hand so are ye in mine hand o hous
of israel

18:7 at what instant i shall speak concern a nation and concern
a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it; 18:8 if
that nation against whom i have pronounc turn from their evil i
will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them

18:9 and at what instant i shall speak concern a nation and
concern a kingdom to build and to plant it; 18:10 if it do evil in
my sight that it obey not my voic then i will repent of the good
wherewith i said i would benefit them

18:11 now therefor go to speak to the men of judah and to the
inhabit of jerusalem say thu saith the lord; behold i frame
evil against you and devis a devic against you: return ye now everi
one from hi evil way and make your way and your do good

18:12 and they said there is no hope: but we will walk after our own
devic and we will everi one do the imagin of hi evil heart

18:13 therefor thu saith the lord; ask ye now among the heathen who
hath heard such things: the virgin of israel hath done a veri horribl
thing

18:14 will a man leav the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock
of the field? or shall the cold flow water that come from anoth
place be forsaken? 18:15 becaus my peopl hath forgotten me they
have burn incens to vaniti and they have caus them to stumbl in
their way from the ancient path to walk in path in a way not cast
up; 18:16 to make their land desol and a perpetu hissing; everi
one that passeth therebi shall be astonish and wag hi head

18:17 i will scatter them as with an east wind befor the enemy; i
will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their
calam

18:18 then said they come and let us devis devic against jeremiah;
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the
wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with
the tongu and let us not give heed to ani of hi word

18:19 give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voic of them that
contend with me

18:20 shall evil be recompens for good? for they have dig a pit
for my soul rememb that i stood befor thee to speak good for them
and to turn away thi wrath from them

18:21 therefor deliv up their children to the famin and pour out
their blood by the forc of the sword; and let their wive be bereav
of their children and be widows; and let their men be put to death;
let their young men be slain by the sword in battl

18:22 let a cri be heard from their hous when thou shalt bring a
troop suddenli upon them: for they have dig a pit to take me and
hid snare for my feet

18:23 yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:
forgiv not their iniqu neither blot out their sin from thi sight
but let them be overthrown befor thee; deal thu with them in the
time of thine anger

19:1 thu saith the lord go and get a potter earthen bottl and
take of the ancient of the peopl and of the ancient of the
priests; 19:2 and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which
is by the entri of the east gate and proclaim there the word that i
shall tell thee 19:3 and say hear ye the word of the lord o king
of judah and inhabit of jerusalem; thu saith the lord of host
the god of israel; behold i will bring evil upon thi place the
which whosoev heareth hi ear shall tingl

19:4 becaus they have forsaken me and have estrang thi place and
have burn incens in it unto other god whom neither they nor their
father have known nor the king of judah and have fill thi place
with the blood of innocents; 19:5 they have built also the high place
of baal to burn their son with fire for burnt offer unto baal
which i command not nor spake it neither came it into my mind:
19:6 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that thi place
shall no more be call tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom
but the valley of slaughter

19:7 and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in thi
place; and i will caus them to fall by the sword befor their
enemi and by the hand of them that seek their lives: and their
carcas will i give to be meat for the fowl of the heaven and for
the beast of the earth

19:8 and i will make thi citi desol and an hissing; everi one
that passeth therebi shall be astonish and hiss becaus of all the
plagu thereof

19:9 and i will caus them to eat the flesh of their son and the
flesh of their daughter and they shall eat everi one the flesh of
hi friend in the sieg and strait wherewith their enemi and
they that seek their live shall straiten them

19:10 then shalt thou break the bottl in the sight of the men that go
with thee 19:11 and shalt say unto them thu saith the lord of
hosts; even so will i break thi peopl and thi citi as one breaketh
a potter vessel that cannot be made whole again: and they shall
buri them in tophet till there be no place to buri

19:12 thu will i do unto thi place saith the lord and to the
inhabit thereof and even make thi citi as tophet: 19:13 and the
hous of jerusalem and the hous of the king of judah shall be
defil as the place of tophet becaus of all the hous upon whose
roof they have burn incens unto all the host of heaven and have
pour out drink offer unto other god

19:14 then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to
prophesy; and he stood in the court of the lord house; and said to
all the peopl 19:15 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel;
behold i will bring upon thi citi and upon all her town all the
evil that i have pronounc against it becaus they have harden
their neck that they might not hear my word

20:1 now pashur the son of immer the priest who wa also chief
governor in the hous of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesi
these thing

20:2 then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stock
that were in the high gate of benjamin which wa by the hous of the
lord

20:3 and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth
jeremiah out of the stock then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath
not call thi name pashur but magormissabib

20:4 for thu saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to
thyself and to all thi friends: and they shall fall by the sword of
their enemi and thine eye shall behold it: and i will give all
judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carri them
captiv into babylon and shall slay them with the sword

20:5 moreov i will deliv all the strength of thi citi and all
the labour thereof and all the preciou thing thereof and all the
treasur of the king of judah will i give into the hand of their
enemi which shall spoil them and take them and carri them to
babylon

20:6 and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine hous shall go into
captivity: and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die
and shalt be buri there thou and all thi friend to whom thou
hast prophesi lie

20:7 o lord thou hast deceiv me and i wa deceived; thou art
stronger than i and hast prevailed: i am in deris daili everi one
mocketh me

20:8 for sinc i spake i cri out i cri violenc and spoil;
becaus the word of the lord wa made a reproach unto me and a
deris daili

20:9 then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak ani more
in hi name but hi word wa in mine heart as a burn fire shut up
in my bone and i wa weari with forbear and i could not stay

20:10 for i heard the defam of mani fear on everi side report
say they and we will report it all my familiar watch for my
halt say peradventur he will be entic and we shall prevail
against him and we shall take our reveng on him

20:11 but the lord is with me as a mighti terribl one: therefor my
persecutor shall stumbl and they shall not prevail: they shall be
greatli ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlast
confus shall never be forgotten

20:12 but o lord of host that triest the righteou and seest the
rein and the heart let me see thi vengeanc on them: for unto thee
have i open my caus

20:13 sing unto the lord prais ye the lord: for he hath deliv
the soul of the poor from the hand of evildo

20:14 curs be the day wherein i wa born: let not the day wherein my
mother bare me be bless

20:15 curs be the man who brought tide to my father say a
man child is born unto thee; make him veri glad

20:16 and let that man be as the citi which the lord overthrew and
repent not: and let him hear the cri in the morn and the
shout at noontide; 20:17 becaus he slew me not from the womb; or
that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be alway
great with me

20:18 wherefor came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow
that my day should be consum with shame? 21:1 the word which came
unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur
the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest
say 21:2 enquir i pray thee of the lord for us; for
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us; if so be that
the lord will deal with us accord to all hi wondrou work that
he may go up from us

21:3 then said jeremiah unto them thu shall ye say to zedekiah: 21:4
thu saith the lord god of israel; behold i will turn back the
weapon of war that are in your hand wherewith ye fight against the
king of babylon and against the chaldean which besieg you without
the wall and i will assembl them into the midst of thi citi

21:5 and i myself will fight against you with an outstretch hand and
with a strong arm even in anger and in furi and in great wrath

21:6 and i will smite the inhabit of thi citi both man and
beast: they shall die of a great pestil

21:7 and afterward saith the lord i will deliv zedekiah king of
judah and hi servant and the peopl and such as are left in thi
citi from the pestil from the sword and from the famin into
the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their
enemi and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall
smite them with the edg of the sword; he shall not spare them
neither have piti nor have merci

21:8 and unto thi peopl thou shalt say thu saith the lord; behold
i set befor you the way of life and the way of death

21:9 he that abideth in thi citi shall die by the sword and by the
famin and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out and falleth to
the chaldean that besieg you he shall live and hi life shall be
unto him for a prey

21:10 for i have set my face against thi citi for evil and not for
good saith the lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of
babylon and he shall burn it with fire

21:11 and touch the hous of the king of judah say hear ye the
word of the lord; 21:12 o hous of david thu saith the lord; execut
judgment in the morn and deliv him that is spoil out of the
hand of the oppressor lest my furi go out like fire and burn that
none can quench it becaus of the evil of your do

21:13 behold i am against thee o inhabit of the valley and rock
of the plain saith the lord; which say who shall come down against
us? or who shall enter into our habitations? 21:14 but i will punish
you accord to the fruit of your do saith the lord: and i will
kindl a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all thing
round about it

22:1 thu saith the lord; go down to the hous of the king of judah
and speak there thi word 22:2 and say hear the word of the lord o
king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thi
servant and thi peopl that enter in by these gates: 22:3 thu saith
the lord; execut ye judgment and righteous and deliv the
spoil out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong do no
violenc to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed
innoc blood in thi place

22:4 for if ye do thi thing inde then shall there enter in by the
gate of thi hous king sit upon the throne of david ride in
chariot and on hors he and hi servant and hi peopl

22:5 but if ye will not hear these word i swear by myself saith the
lord that thi hous shall becom a desol

22:6 for thu saith the lord unto the king hous of judah; thou art
gilead unto me and the head of lebanon: yet sure i will make thee a
wilder and citi which are not inhabit

22:7 and i will prepar destroy against thee everi one with hi
weapons: and they shall cut down thi choic cedar and cast them into
the fire

22:8 and mani nation shall pass by thi citi and they shall say
everi man to hi neighbour wherefor hath the lord done thu unto
thi great city? 22:9 then they shall answer becaus they have
forsaken the coven of the lord their god and worship other
god and serv them

22:10 weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
him that goeth away: for he shall return no more nor see hi nativ
countri

22:11 for thu saith the lord touch shallum the son of josiah king
of judah which reign instead of josiah hi father which went forth
out of thi place; he shall not return thither ani more: 22:12 but he
shall die in the place whither they have led him captiv and shall
see thi land no more

22:13 woe unto him that buildeth hi hous by unright and hi
chamber by wrong; that useth hi neighbour servic without wage
and giveth him not for hi work; 22:14 that saith i will build me a
wide hous and larg chamber and cutteth him out windows; and it is
ciel with cedar and paint with vermilion

22:15 shalt thou reign becaus thou closest thyself in cedar? did not
thi father eat and drink and do judgment and justic and then it wa
well with him? 22:16 he judg the caus of the poor and needy; then
it wa well with him: wa not thi to know me? saith the lord

22:17 but thine eye and thine heart are not but for thi covet
and for to shed innoc blood and for oppress and for violenc
to do it

22:18 therefor thu saith the lord concern jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah; they shall not lament for him say ah my
brother! or ah sister! they shall not lament for him say ah
lord! or ah hi glory! 22:19 he shall be buri with the burial of
an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gate of jerusalem

22:20 go up to lebanon and cry; and lift up thi voic in bashan and
cri from the passages: for all thi lover are destroy

22:21 i spake unto thee in thi prosperity; but thou saidst i will not
hear thi hath been thi manner from thi youth that thou obeyedst not
my voic

22:22 the wind shall eat up all thi pastor and thi lover shall go
into captivity: sure then shalt thou be asham and confound for
all thi wicked

22:23 o inhabit of lebanon that makest thi nest in the cedar how
graciou shalt thou be when pang come upon thee the pain as of a
woman in travail! 22:24 as i live saith the lord though coniah the
son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet
would i pluck thee thence; 22:25 and i will give thee into the hand of
them that seek thi life and into the hand of them whose face thou
fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and
into the hand of the chaldean

22:26 and i will cast thee out and thi mother that bare thee into
anoth countri where ye were not born; and there shall ye die

22:27 but to the land whereunto they desir to return thither shall
they not return

22:28 is thi man coniah a despis broken idol? is he a vessel
wherein is no pleasure? wherefor are they cast out he and hi seed
and are cast into a land which they know not? 22:29 o earth earth
earth hear the word of the lord

22:30 thu saith the lord write ye thi man childless a man that
shall not prosper in hi days: for no man of hi seed shall prosper
sit upon the throne of david and rule ani more in judah

23:1 woe be unto the pastor that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
pasture! saith the lord

23:2 therefor thu saith the lord god of israel against the pastor
that feed my people; ye have scatter my flock and driven them away
and have not visit them: behold i will visit upon you the evil of
your do saith the lord

23:3 and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countri
whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds;
and they shall be fruit and increas

23:4 and i will set up shepherd over them which shall feed them: and
they shall fear no more nor be dismay neither shall they be
lack saith the lord

23:5 behold the day come saith the lord that i will rais unto
david a righteou branch and a king shall reign and prosper and
shall execut judgment and justic in the earth

23:6 in hi day judah shall be save and israel shall dwell safely:
and thi is hi name wherebi he shall be call the lord our
righteous

23:7 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that they shall
no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel
out of the land of egypt; 23:8 but the lord liveth which brought up
and which led the seed of the hous of israel out of the north
countri and from all countri whither i had driven them; and they
shall dwell in their own land

23:9 mine heart within me is broken becaus of the prophets; all my
bone shake; i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath
overcom becaus of the lord and becaus of the word of hi
holi

23:10 for the land is full of adulterers; for becaus of swear the
land mourneth; the pleasant place of the wilder are dri up and
their cours is evil and their forc is not right

23:11 for both prophet and priest are profane; yea in my hous have i
found their wicked saith the lord

23:12 wherefor their way shall be unto them as slipperi way in the
darkness: they shall be driven on and fall therein: for i will bring
evil upon them even the year of their visit saith the lord

23:13 and i have seen folli in the prophet of samaria; they
prophesi in baal and caus my peopl israel to err

23:14 i have seen also in the prophet of jerusalem an horribl thing:
they commit adulteri and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hand
of evildo that none doth return from hi wickedness; they are all
of them unto me as sodom and the inhabit thereof as gomorrah

23:15 therefor thu saith the lord of host concern the prophets;
behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water
of gall: for from the prophet of jerusalem is profan gone forth
into all the land

23:16 thu saith the lord of host hearken not unto the word of the
prophet that prophesi unto you: they make you vain: they speak a
vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord

23:17 they say still unto them that despis me the lord hath said ye
shall have peace; and they say unto everi one that walketh after the
imagin of hi own heart no evil shall come upon you

23:18 for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath
perceiv and heard hi word? who hath mark hi word and heard it?
23:19 behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in furi even a
grievou whirlwind: it shall fall grievous upon the head of the
wick

23:20 the anger of the lord shall not return until he have execut
and till he have perform the thought of hi heart: in the latter
day ye shall consid it perfectli

23:21 i have not sent these prophet yet they ran: i have not spoken
to them yet they prophesi

23:22 but if they had stood in my counsel and had caus my peopl to
hear my word then they should have turn them from their evil way
and from the evil of their do

23:23 am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off?
23:24 can ani hide himself in secret place that i shall not see him?
saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth? saith the lord

23:25 i have heard what the prophet said that prophesi lie in my
name say i have dream i have dream

23:26 how long shall thi be in the heart of the prophet that
prophesi lies? yea they are prophet of the deceit of their own
heart; 23:27 which think to caus my peopl to forget my name by their
dream which they tell everi man to hi neighbour as their father
have forgotten my name for baal

23:28 the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream; and he that
hath my word let him speak my word faith what is the chaff to
the wheat? saith the lord

23:29 is not my word like as a fire? saith the lord; and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces? 23:30 therefor behold i am
against the prophet saith the lord that steal my word everi one
from hi neighbour

23:31 behold i am against the prophet saith the lord that use
their tongu and say he saith

23:32 behold i am against them that prophesi fals dream saith the
lord and do tell them and caus my peopl to err by their lie and
by their lightness; yet i sent them not nor command them: therefor
they shall not profit thi peopl at all saith the lord

23:33 and when thi peopl or the prophet or a priest shall ask
thee say what is the burden of the lord? thou shalt then say unto
them what burden? i will even forsak you saith the lord

23:34 and as for the prophet and the priest and the peopl that
shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and hi
hous

23:35 thu shall ye say everi one to hi neighbour and everi one to
hi brother what hath the lord answered? and what hath the lord
spoken? 23:36 and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more:
for everi man word shall be hi burden; for ye have pervert the
word of the live god of the lord of host our god

23:37 thu shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answer
thee? and what hath the lord spoken? 23:38 but sinc ye say the
burden of the lord; therefor thu saith the lord; becaus ye say thi
word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you say ye
shall not say the burden of the lord; 23:39 therefor behold i
even i will utterli forget you and i will forsak you and the citi
that i gave you and your father and cast you out of my presence:
23:40 and i will bring an everlast reproach upon you and a
perpetu shame which shall not be forgotten

24:1 the lord shew me and behold two basket of fig were set
befor the templ of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of
babylon had carri away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of
judah and the princ of judah with the carpent and smith from
jerusalem and had brought them to babylon

24:2 one basket had veri good fig even like the fig that are first
ripe: and the other basket had veri naughti fig which could not be
eaten they were so bad

24:3 then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah? and i
said figs; the good fig veri good; and the evil veri evil that
cannot be eaten they are so evil

24:4 again the word of the lord came unto me say 24:5 thu saith
the lord the god of israel; like these good fig so will i
acknowledg them that are carri away captiv of judah whom i have
sent out of thi place into the land of the chaldean for their good

24:6 for i will set mine eye upon them for good and i will bring
them again to thi land: and i will build them and not pull them
down; and i will plant them and not pluck them up

24:7 and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord: and
they shall be my peopl and i will be their god: for they shall
return unto me with their whole heart

24:8 and as the evil fig which cannot be eaten they are so evil;
sure thu saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah
and hi princ and the residu of jerusalem that remain in thi
land and them that dwell in the land of egypt: 24:9 and i will
deliv them to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth for
their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curs in
all place whither i shall drive them

24:10 and i will send the sword the famin and the pestil among
them till they be consum from off the land that i gave unto them
and to their father

25:1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the peopl of judah
in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that
wa the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon; 25:2 the which
jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the peopl of judah and to all
the inhabit of jerusalem say 25:3 from the thirteenth year of
josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto thi day that is the
three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and
i have spoken unto you rise earli and speaking; but ye have not
hearken

25:4 and the lord hath sent unto you all hi servant the prophet
rise earli and send them; but ye have not hearken nor inclin
your ear to hear

25:5 they said turn ye again now everi one from hi evil way and
from the evil of your do and dwell in the land that the lord hath
given unto you and to your father for ever and ever: 25:6 and go not
after other god to serv them and to worship them and provok me
not to anger with the work of your hands; and i will do you no hurt

25:7 yet ye have not hearken unto me saith the lord; that ye might
provok me to anger with the work of your hand to your own hurt

25:8 therefor thu saith the lord of hosts; becaus ye have not heard
my word 25:9 behold i will send and take all the famili of the
north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my
servant and will bring them against thi land and against the
inhabit thereof and against all these nation round about and
will utterli destroy them and make them an astonish and an
hiss and perpetu desol

25:10 moreov i will take from them the voic of mirth and the voic
of glad the voic of the bridegroom and the voic of the bride
the sound of the millston and the light of the candl

25:11 and thi whole land shall be a desol and an astonishment;
and these nation shall serv the king of babylon seventi year

25:12 and it shall come to pass when seventi year are accomplish
that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the
lord for their iniqu and the land of the chaldean and will make
it perpetu desol

25:13 and i will bring upon that land all my word which i have
pronounc against it even all that is written in thi book which
jeremiah hath prophesi against all the nation

25:14 for mani nation and great king shall serv themselv of them
also: and i will recompens them accord to their deed and

25:15 for thu saith the lord god of israel unto me; take the wine cup
of thi furi at my hand and caus all the nation to whom i send

25:16 and they shall drink and be move and be mad becaus of the

25:17 then took i the cup at the lord hand and made all the nation

the citi of judah and the king thereof and the princ thereof
to make them a desol an astonish an hiss and a curse;

25:25 and all the king of zimri and all the king of elam and all
the king of the mede 25:26 and all the king of the north far and
near one with anoth and all the kingdom of the world which are
upon the face of the earth: and the king of sheshach shall drink after
them

25:27 therefor thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord of
host the god of israel; drink ye and be drunken and spue and
fall and rise no more becaus of the sword which i will send among

25:28 and it shall be if they refus to take the cup at thine hand to

25:29 for lo i begin to bring evil on the citi which is call by my
name and should ye be utterli unpunished? ye shall not be unpunished:
for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabit of the earth
saith the lord of host

25:30 therefor prophesi thou against them all these word and say
unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter hi voic from
hi holi habitation; he shall mightili roar upon hi habitation; he
shall give a shout as they that tread the grape against all the
inhabit of the earth

25:31 a nois shall come even to the end of the earth; for the lord
hath a controversi with the nation he will plead with all flesh; he
will give them that are wick to the sword saith the lord

25:32 thu saith the lord of host behold evil shall go forth from
nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be rais up from the
coast of the earth

25:33 and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of
the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be
lament neither gather nor buried; they shall be dung upon the
ground

25:34 howl ye shepherd and cry; and wallow yourselv in the ash
ye princip of the flock: for the day of your slaughter and of your
dispers are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant
vessel

25:35 and the shepherd shall have no way to flee nor the princip
of the flock to escap

25:36 a voic of the cri of the shepherd and an howl of the
princip of the flock shall be heard: for the lord hath spoil
their pastur

25:37 and the peaceabl habit are cut down becaus of the fierc
anger of the lord

25:38 he hath forsaken hi covert as the lion: for their land is
desol becaus of the fierc of the oppressor and becaus of
hi fierc anger

26:1 in the begin of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king
of judah came thi word from the lord say 26:2 thu saith the
lord; stand in the court of the lord hous and speak unto all the
citi of judah which come to worship in the lord hous all the
word that i command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:
26:3 if so be they will hearken and turn everi man from hi evil way
that i may repent me of the evil which i purpos to do unto them
becaus of the evil of their do

26:4 and thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord; if ye will not
hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set befor you 26:5 to
hearken to the word of my servant the prophet whom i sent unto
you both rise up earli and send them but ye have not
hearkened; 26:6 then will i make thi hous like shiloh and will make
thi citi a curs to all the nation of the earth

26:7 so the priest and the prophet and all the peopl heard jeremiah
speak these word in the hous of the lord

26:8 now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speak
all that the lord had command him to speak unto all the peopl that
the priest and the prophet and all the peopl took him say thou
shalt sure die

26:9 whi hast thou prophesi in the name of the lord say thi
hous shall be like shiloh and thi citi shall be desol without an
inhabitant? and all the peopl were gather against jeremiah in the
hous of the lord

26:10 when the princ of judah heard these thing then they came up
from the king hous unto the hous of the lord and sat down in the
entri of the new gate of the lord hous

26:11 then spake the priest and the prophet unto the princ and to
all the peopl say thi man is worthi to die; for he hath
prophesi against thi citi as ye have heard with your ear

26:12 then spake jeremiah unto all the princ and to all the peopl
say the lord sent me to prophesi against thi hous and against
thi citi all the word that ye have heard

26:13 therefor now amend your way and your do and obey the
voic of the lord your god; and the lord will repent him of the evil
that he hath pronounc against you

26:14 as for me behold i am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good
and meet unto you

26:15 but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall
sure bring innoc blood upon yourselv and upon thi citi and
upon the inhabit thereof: for of a truth the lord hath sent me
unto you to speak all these word in your ear

26:16 then said the princ and all the peopl unto the priest and to
the prophets; thi man is not worthi to die: for he hath spoken to us
in the name of the lord our god

26:17 then rose up certain of the elder of the land and spake to all
the assembl of the peopl say 26:18 micah the morasthit
prophesi in the day of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the
peopl of judah say thu saith the lord of hosts; zion shall be
plow like a field and jerusalem shall becom heap and the
mountain of the hous as the high place of a forest

26:19 did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to
death? did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord
repent him of the evil which he had pronounc against them? thu
might we procur great evil against our soul

26:20 and there wa also a man that prophesi in the name of the
lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesi
against thi citi and against thi land accord to all the word of
jeremiah

26:21 and when jehoiakim the king with all hi mighti men and all
the princ heard hi word the king sought to put him to death: but
when urijah heard it he wa afraid and fled and went into egypt;
26:22 and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt name elnathan the
son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt

26:23 and they fetch forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto
jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword and cast hi dead
bodi into the grave of the common peopl

26:24 nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan wa with
jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the peopl to
put him to death

27:1 in the begin of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king
of judah came thi word unto jeremiah from the lord say 27:2 thu
saith the lord to me; make thee bond and yoke and put them upon thi
neck 27:3 and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab
and to the king of the ammonit and to the king of tyru and to the
king of zidon by the hand of the messeng which come to jerusalem
unto zedekiah king of judah; 27:4 and command them to say unto their
master thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; thu shall
ye say unto your masters; 27:5 i have made the earth the man and the
beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my
outstretch arm and have given it unto whom it seem meet unto me

27:6 and now have i given all these land into the hand of
nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant; and the beast of the
field have i given him also to serv him

27:7 and all nation shall serv him and hi son and hi son son
until the veri time of hi land come: and then mani nation and great
king shall serv themselv of him

27:8 and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will
not serv the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will
not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation
will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famin
and with the pestil until i have consum them by hi hand

27:9 therefor hearken not ye to your prophet nor to your divin
nor to your dreamer nor to your enchant nor to your sorcer
which speak unto you say ye shall not serv the king of babylon:
27:10 for they prophesi a lie unto you to remov you far from your
land; and that i should drive you out and ye should perish

27:11 but the nation that bring their neck under the yoke of the king
of babylon and serv him those will i let remain still in their own
land saith the lord; and they shall till it and dwell therein

27:12 i spake also to zedekiah king of judah accord to all these
word say bring your neck under the yoke of the king of babylon
and serv him and hi peopl and live

27:13 whi will ye die thou and thi peopl by the sword by the
famin and by the pestil as the lord hath spoken against the
nation that will not serv the king of babylon? 27:14 therefor
hearken not unto the word of the prophet that speak unto you
say ye shall not serv the king of babylon: for they prophesi a
lie unto you

27:15 for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesi a
lie in my name; that i might drive you out and that ye might perish
ye and the prophet that prophesi unto you

27:16 also i spake to the priest and to all thi peopl say thu
saith the lord; hearken not to the word of your prophet that
prophesi unto you say behold the vessel of the lord hous
shall now shortli be brought again from babylon: for they prophesi a
lie unto you

27:17 hearken not unto them; serv the king of babylon and live:
wherefor should thi citi be laid waste? 27:18 but if they be
prophet and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make
intercess to the lord of host that the vessel which are left in
the hous of the lord and in the hous of the king of judah and at
jerusalem go not to babylon

27:19 for thu saith the lord of host concern the pillar and
concern the sea and concern the base and concern the
residu of the vessel that remain in thi citi

27:20 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carri
away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from
jerusalem to babylon and all the nobl of judah and jerusalem; 27:21
yea thu saith the lord of host the god of israel concern the
vessel that remain in the hous of the lord and in the hous of the
king of judah and of jerusalem; 27:22 they shall be carri to
babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them
saith the lord; then will i bring them up and restor them to thi
place

28:1 and it came to pass the same year in the begin of the reign
of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month
that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which wa of gibeon spake
unto me in the hous of the lord in the presenc of the priest and
of all the peopl say 28:2 thu speaketh the lord of host the
god of israel say i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon

28:3 within two full year will i bring again into thi place all the
vessel of the lord hous that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took
away from thi place and carri them to babylon: 28:4 and i will
bring again to thi place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah
with all the captiv of judah that went into babylon saith the
lord: for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon

28:5 then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the
presenc of the priest and in the presenc of all the peopl that
stood in the hous of the lord 28:6 even the prophet jeremiah said
amen: the lord do so: the lord perform thi word which thou hast
prophesi to bring again the vessel of the lord hous and all
that is carri away captiv from babylon into thi place

28:7 nevertheless hear thou now thi word that i speak in thine ear
and in the ear of all the people; 28:8 the prophet that have been
befor me and befor thee of old prophesi both against mani
countri and against great kingdom of war and of evil and of
pestil

28:9 the prophet which prophesieth of peac when the word of the
prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the
lord hath truli sent him

28:10 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
jeremiah neck and brake it

28:11 and hananiah spake in the presenc of all the peopl say
thu saith the lord; even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar
king of babylon from the neck of all nation within the space of two
full year and the prophet jeremiah went hi way

28:12 then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after
that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the
prophet jeremiah say 28:13 go and tell hananiah say thu
saith the lord; thou hast broken the yoke of wood; but thou shalt
make for them yoke of iron

28:14 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; i have put
a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nation that they may serv
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon; and they shall serv him: and i have
given him the beast of the field also

28:15 then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear
now hananiah; the lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest thi
peopl to trust in a lie

28:16 therefor thu saith the lord; behold i will cast thee from off
the face of the earth: thi year thou shalt die becaus thou hast
taught rebellion against the lord

28:17 so hananiah the prophet die the same year in the seventh month

29:1 now these are the word of the letter that jeremiah the prophet
sent from jerusalem unto the residu of the elder which were carri
away captiv and to the priest and to the prophet and to all the
peopl whom nebuchadnezzar had carri away captiv from jerusalem to
babylon; 29:2 (after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the
eunuch the princ of judah and jerusalem and the carpent and
the smith were depart from jerusalem;) 29:3 by the hand of elasah
the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah (whom zedekiah
king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon)
say 29:4 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel unto all
that are carri away captiv whom i have caus to be carri away
from jerusalem unto babylon; 29:5 build ye hous and dwell in them;
and plant garden and eat the fruit of them; 29:6 take ye wive and
beget son and daughters; and take wive for your son and give your
daughter to husband that they may bear son and daughters; that ye
may be increas there and not diminish

29:7 and seek the peac of the citi whither i have caus you to be
carri away captiv and pray unto the lord for it: for in the peac
thereof shall ye have peac

29:8 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; let not your
prophet and your divin that be in the midst of you deceiv you
neither hearken to your dream which ye caus to be dream

29:9 for they prophesi fals unto you in my name: i have not sent
them saith the lord

29:10 for thu saith the lord that after seventi year be
accomplish at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word
toward you in caus you to return to thi place

29:11 for i know the thought that i think toward you saith the lord
thought of peac and not of evil to give you an expect end

29:12 then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me
and i will hearken unto you

29:13 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me
with all your heart

29:14 and i will be found of you saith the lord: and i will turn away
your captiv and i will gather you from all the nation and from
all the place whither i have driven you saith the lord; and i will
bring you again into the place whenc i caus you to be carri away
captiv

29:15 becaus ye have said the lord hath rais us up prophet in
babylon; 29:16 know that thu saith the lord of the king that sitteth
upon the throne of david and of all the peopl that dwelleth in thi
citi and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into
captivity; 29:17 thu saith the lord of hosts; behold i will send
upon them the sword the famin and the pestil and will make
them like vile fig that cannot be eaten they are so evil

29:18 and i will persecut them with the sword with the famin and
with the pestil and will deliv them to be remov to all the
kingdom of the earth to be a curs and an astonish and an
hiss and a reproach among all the nation whither i have driven
them: 29:19 becaus they have not hearken to my word saith the
lord which i sent unto them by my servant the prophet rise up
earli and send them; but ye would not hear saith the lord

29:20 hear ye therefor the word of the lord all ye of the captiv
whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon: 29:21 thu saith the lord
of host the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of
zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesi a lie unto you in my
name; behold i will deliv them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king
of babylon; and he shall slay them befor your eyes; 29:22 and of them
shall be taken up a curs by all the captiv of judah which are in
babylon say the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom
the king of babylon roast in the fire; 29:23 becaus they have
commit villani in israel and have commit adulteri with their
neighbour wive and have spoken lie word in my name which i
have not command them; even i know and am a wit saith the
lord

29:24 thu shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamit say
29:25 thu speaketh the lord of host the god of israel say
becaus thou hast sent letter in thi name unto all the peopl that
are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and
to all the priest say 29:26 the lord hath made thee priest in
the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be offic in the
hous of the lord for everi man that is mad and maketh himself a
prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stock

29:27 now therefor whi hast thou not reprov jeremiah of anathoth
which maketh himself a prophet to you? 29:28 for therefor he sent
unto us in babylon say thi captiv is long: build ye hous
and dwell in them; and plant garden and eat the fruit of them

29:29 and zephaniah the priest read thi letter in the ear of
jeremiah the prophet

29:30 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah say 29:31 send
to all them of the captiv say thu saith the lord concern
shemaiah the nehelamite; becaus that shemaiah hath prophesi unto
you and i sent him not and he caus you to trust in a lie: 29:32
therefor thu saith the lord; behold i will punish shemaiah the
nehelamit and hi seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among thi
people; neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my peopl
saith the lord; becaus he hath taught rebellion against the lord

30:1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord say 30:2 thu
speaketh the lord god of israel say write thee all the word that
i have spoken unto thee in a book

30:3 for lo the day come saith the lord that i will bring again
the captiv of my peopl israel and judah saith the lord: and i
will caus them to return to the land that i gave to their father
and they shall possess it

30:4 and these are the word that the lord spake concern israel and
concern judah

30:5 for thu saith the lord; we have heard a voic of trembl of
fear and not of peac

30:6 ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child?
wherefor do i see everi man with hi hand on hi loin as a woman
in travail and all face are turn into paleness? 30:7 alas! for
that day is great so that none is like it: it is even the time of
jacob troubl but he shall be save out of it

30:8 for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of host
that i will break hi yoke from off thi neck and will burst thi
bond and stranger shall no more serv themselv of him: 30:9 but
they shall serv the lord their god and david their king whom i will
rais up unto them

30:10 therefor fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord;
neither be dismay o israel: for lo i will save thee from afar
and thi seed from the land of their captivity; and jacob shall return
and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid

30:11 for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee: though i make
a full end of all nation whither i have scatter thee yet i will
not make a full end of thee: but i will correct thee in measur and
will not leav thee altogeth unpunish

30:12 for thu saith the lord thi bruis is incur and thi wound
is grievou

30:13 there is none to plead thi caus that thou mayest be bound up:
thou hast no heal medicin

30:14 all thi lover have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for i
have wound thee with the wound of an enemi with the chastis of
a cruel one for the multitud of thine iniquity; becaus thi sin
were increas

30:15 whi criest thou for thine affliction? thi sorrow is incur
for the multitud of thine iniquity: becaus thi sin were increas
i have done these thing unto thee

30:16 therefor all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
thine adversari everi one of them shall go into captivity; and
they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee
will i give for a prey

30:17 for i will restor health unto thee and i will heal thee of thi
wound saith the lord; becaus they call thee an outcast say
thi is zion whom no man seeketh after

30:18 thu saith the lord; behold i will bring again the captiv of
jacob tent and have merci on hi dwellingplaces; and the citi
shall be build upon her own heap and the palac shall remain after
the manner thereof

30:19 and out of them shall proceed thanksgiv and the voic of them
that make merry: and i will multipli them and they shall not be few;
i will also glorifi them and they shall not be small

30:20 their children also shall be as aforetim and their
congreg shall be establish befor me and i will punish all
that oppress them

30:21 and their nobl shall be of themselv and their governor
shall proceed from the midst of them; and i will caus him to draw
near and he shall approach unto me: for who is thi that engag hi
heart to approach unto me? saith the lord

30:22 and ye shall be my peopl and i will be your god

30:23 behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with furi a
continu whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the
wick

30:24 the fierc anger of the lord shall not return until he hath
done it and until he have perform the intent of hi heart: in the
latter day ye shall consid it

31:1 at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the
famili of israel and they shall be my peopl

31:2 thu saith the lord the peopl which were left of the sword
found grace in the wilderness; even israel when i went to caus him
to rest

31:3 the lord hath appear of old unto me say yea i have love
thee with an everlast love: therefor with lovingkind have i
drawn thee

31:4 again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of
israel: thou shalt again be adorn with thi tabret and shalt go
forth in the danc of them that make merri

31:5 thou shalt yet plant vine upon the mountain of samaria: the
planter shall plant and shall eat them as common thing

31:6 for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount
ephraim shall cri aris ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord
our god

31:7 for thu saith the lord; sing with glad for jacob and shout
among the chief of the nations: publish ye prais ye and say o
lord save thi peopl the remnant of israel

31:8 behold i will bring them from the north countri and gather them
from the coast of the earth and with them the blind and the lame
the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a
great compani shall return thither

31:9 they shall come with weep and with supplic will i lead
them: i will caus them to walk by the river of water in a straight
way wherein they shall not stumble: for i am a father to israel and
ephraim is my firstborn

31:10 hear the word of the lord o ye nation and declar it in the
isl afar off and say he that scatter israel will gather him and
keep him as a shepherd doth hi flock

31:11 for the lord hath redeem jacob and ransom him from the hand
of him that wa stronger than he

31:12 therefor they shall come and sing in the height of zion and
shall flow togeth to the good of the lord for wheat and for
wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and
their soul shall be as a water garden; and they shall not sorrow ani
more at all

31:13 then shall the virgin rejoic in the danc both young men and
old together: for i will turn their mourn into joy and will
comfort them and make them rejoic from their sorrow

31:14 and i will satiat the soul of the priest with fat and my
peopl shall be satisfi with my good saith the lord

31:15 thu saith the lord; a voic wa heard in ramah lament
and bitter weeping; rahel weep for her children refus to be
comfort for her children becaus they were not

31:16 thu saith the lord; refrain thi voic from weep and thine
eye from tears: for thi work shall be reward saith the lord; and
they shall come again from the land of the enemi

31:17 and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thi
children shall come again to their own border

31:18 i have sure heard ephraim bemoan himself thus; thou hast
chastis me and i wa chastis as a bullock unaccustom to the
yoke: turn thou me and i shall be turned; for thou art the lord my
god

31:19 sure after that i wa turn i repented; and after that i wa
instruct i smote upon my thigh: i wa asham yea even
confound becaus i did bear the reproach of my youth

31:20 is ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for sinc i
spake against him i do earnestli rememb him still: therefor my
bowel are troubl for him; i will sure have merci upon him saith
the lord

31:21 set thee up waymark make thee high heaps: set thine heart
toward the highway even the way which thou wentest: turn again o
virgin of israel turn again to these thi citi

31:22 how long wilt thou go about o thou backslid daughter? for
the lord hath creat a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass
a man

31:23 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; as yet they
shall use thi speech in the land of judah and in the citi thereof
when i shall bring again their captivity; the lord bless thee o
habit of justic and mountain of holi

31:24 and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the citi
thereof togeth husbandmen and they that go forth with flock

31:25 for i have satiat the weari soul and i have replenish everi
sorrow soul

31:26 upon thi i awak and beheld; and my sleep wa sweet unto me

31:27 behold the day come saith the lord that i will sow the hous
of israel and the hous of judah with the seed of man and with the
seed of beast

31:28 and it shall come to pass that like as i have watch over
them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to
destroy and to afflict; so will i watch over them to build and to
plant saith the lord

31:29 in those day they shall say no more the father have eaten a
sour grape and the children teeth are set on edg

31:30 but everi one shall die for hi own iniquity: everi man that
eateth the sour grape hi teeth shall be set on edg

31:31 behold the day come saith the lord that i will make a new
coven with the hous of israel and with the hous of judah: 31:32
not accord to the coven that i made with their father in the
day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
egypt; which my coven they brake although i wa an husband unto
them saith the lord: 31:33 but thi shall be the coven that i will
make with the hous of israel; after those day saith the lord i
will put my law in their inward part and write it in their hearts;
and will be their god and they shall be my peopl

31:34 and they shall teach no more everi man hi neighbour and everi
man hi brother say know the lord: for they shall all know me
from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord: for
i will forgiv their iniqu and i will rememb their sin no more

31:35 thu saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day
and the ordin of the moon and of the star for a light by night
which divideth the sea when the wave thereof roar; the lord of host
is hi name: 31:36 if those ordin depart from befor me saith
the lord then the seed of israel also shall ceas from be a nation
befor me for ever

31:37 thu saith the lord; if heaven abov can be measur and the
foundat of the earth search out beneath i will also cast off
all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord

31:38 behold the day come saith the lord that the citi shall be
built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the
corner

31:39 and the measur line shall yet go forth over against it upon
the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath

31:40 and the whole valley of the dead bodi and of the ash and
all the field unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the hors
gate toward the east shall be holi unto the lord; it shall not be
pluck up nor thrown down ani more for ever

32:1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of
zedekiah king of judah which wa the eighteenth year of
nebuchadrezzar

32:2 for then the king of babylon armi besieg jerusalem: and
jeremiah the prophet wa shut up in the court of the prison which wa
in the king of judah hous

32:3 for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up say wherefor
dost thou prophesi and say thu saith the lord behold i will give
thi citi into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it;
32:4 and zedekiah king of judah shall not escap out of the hand of
the chaldean but shall sure be deliv into the hand of the king
of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and hi eye
shall behold hi eyes; 32:5 and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and
there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord: though ye fight
with the chaldean ye shall not prosper

32:6 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me say
32:7 behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncl shall come unto
thee say buy thee my field that is in anathoth: for the right of
redempt is thine to buy it

32:8 so hanameel mine uncl son came to me in the court of the
prison accord to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my
field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the countri of
benjamin: for the right of inherit is thine and the redempt is
thine; buy it for thyself

then i knew that thi wa the word of the lord

32:9 and i bought the field of hanameel my uncl son that wa in
anathoth and weigh him the money even seventeen shekel of silver

32:10 and i subscrib the evid and seal it and took
wit and weigh him the money in the balanc

32:11 so i took the evid of the purchas both that which wa
seal accord to the law and custom and that which wa open: 32:12
and i gave the evid of the purchas unto baruch the son of neriah
the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncl son and in
the presenc of the wit that subscrib the book of the
purchas befor all the jew that sat in the court of the prison

32:13 and i charg baruch befor them say 32:14 thu saith the
lord of host the god of israel; take these evid thi evid
of the purchas both which is seal and thi evid which is
open; and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continu mani
day

32:15 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; hous and
field and vineyard shall be possess again in thi land

32:16 now when i had deliv the evid of the purchas unto
baruch the son of neriah i pray unto the lord say 32:17 ah
lord god! behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thi great
power and stretch out arm and there is noth too hard for thee:
32:18 thou shewest lovingkind unto thousand and recompensest the
iniqu of the father into the bosom of their children after them:
the great the mighti god the lord of host is hi name 32:19 great
in counsel and mighti in work: for thine eye are open upon all the
way of the son of men: to give everi one accord to hi way and
accord to the fruit of hi doings: 32:20 which hast set sign and
wonder in the land of egypt even unto thi day and in israel and
among other men; and hast made thee a name as at thi day; 32:21 and
hast brought forth thi peopl israel out of the land of egypt with
sign and with wonder and with a strong hand and with a stretch
out arm and with great terror; 32:22 and hast given them thi land
which thou didst swear to their father to give them a land flow
with milk and honey; 32:23 and they came in and possess it; but
they obey not thi voic neither walk in thi law; they have done
noth of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefor thou hast
caus all thi evil to come upon them: 32:24 behold the mount they
are come unto the citi to take it; and the citi is given into the hand
of the chaldean that fight against it becaus of the sword and of
the famin and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come
to pass; and behold thou seest it

32:25 and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for
money and take witnesses; for the citi is given into the hand of the
chaldean

32:26 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah say 32:27
behold i am the lord the god of all flesh: is there ani thing too
hard for me? 32:28 therefor thu saith the lord; behold i will give
thi citi into the hand of the chaldean and into the hand of
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it: 32:29 and the
chaldean that fight against thi citi shall come and set fire on
thi citi and burn it with the hous upon whose roof they have
offer incens unto baal and pour out drink offer unto other
god to provok me to anger

32:30 for the children of israel and the children of judah have onli
done evil befor me from their youth: for the children of israel have
onli provok me to anger with the work of their hand saith the
lord

32:31 for thi citi hath been to me as a provoc of mine anger and
of my furi from the day that they built it even unto thi day; that i
should remov it from befor my face 32:32 becaus of all the evil of
the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have
done to provok me to anger they their king their princ their
priest and their prophet and the men of judah and the inhabit
of jerusalem

32:33 and they have turn unto me the back and not the face: though
i taught them rise up earli and teach them yet they have not
hearken to receiv instruct

32:34 but they set their abomin in the hous which is call by
my name to defil it

32:35 and they built the high place of baal which are in the valley
of the son of hinnom to caus their son and their daughter to pass
through the fire unto molech; which i command them not neither came
it into my mind that they should do thi abomin to caus judah
to sin

32:36 and now therefor thu saith the lord the god of israel
concern thi citi whereof ye say it shall be deliv into the
hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famin and by
the pestilence; 32:37 behold i will gather them out of all countri
whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my furi and in great
wrath; and i will bring them again unto thi place and i will caus
them to dwell safely: 32:38 and they shall be my peopl and i will be
their god: 32:39 and i will give them one heart and one way that
they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children
after them: 32:40 and i will make an everlast coven with them
that i will not turn away from them to do them good; but i will put
my fear in their heart that they shall not depart from me

32:41 yea i will rejoic over them to do them good and i will plant
them in thi land assuredli with my whole heart and with my whole
soul

32:42 for thu saith the lord; like as i have brought all thi great
evil upon thi peopl so will i bring upon them all the good that i
have promis them

32:43 and field shall be bought in thi land whereof ye say it is
desol without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the
chaldean

32:44 men shall buy field for money and subscrib evid and
seal them and take wit in the land of benjamin and in the
place about jerusalem and in the citi of judah and in the citi
of the mountain and in the citi of the valley and in the citi
of the south: for i will caus their captiv to return saith the
lord

33:1 moreov the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time
while he wa yet shut up in the court of the prison say 33:2 thu
saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that form it to
establish it; the lord is hi name; 33:3 call unto me and i will
answer thee and shew thee great and mighti thing which thou knowest
not

33:4 for thu saith the lord the god of israel concern the hous
of thi citi and concern the hous of the king of judah which
are thrown down by the mount and by the sword; 33:5 they come to
fight with the chaldean but it is to fill them with the dead bodi
of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my furi and for all
whose wicked i have hid my face from thi citi

33:6 behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them
and will reveal unto them the abund of peac and truth

33:7 and i will caus the captiv of judah and the captiv of
israel to return and will build them as at the first

33:8 and i will cleans them from all their iniqu wherebi they
have sin against me; and i will pardon all their iniqu
wherebi they have sin and wherebi they have transgress against
me

33:9 and it shall be to me a name of joy a prais and an honour
befor all the nation of the earth which shall hear all the good
that i do unto them: and they shall fear and trembl for all the
good and for all the prosper that i procur unto it

33:10 thu saith the lord; again there shall be heard in thi place
which ye say shall be desol without man and without beast even in
the citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem that are
desol without man and without inhabit and without beast
33:11 the voic of joy and the voic of glad the voic of the
bridegroom and the voic of the bride the voic of them that shall
say prais the lord of hosts: for the lord is good; for hi merci
endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrific of
prais into the hous of the lord for i will caus to return the
captiv of the land as at the first saith the lord

33:12 thu saith the lord of hosts; again in thi place which is
desol without man and without beast and in all the citi thereof
shall be an habit of shepherd caus their flock to lie down

33:13 in the citi of the mountain in the citi of the vale and
in the citi of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the
place about jerusalem and in the citi of judah shall the flock
pass again under the hand of him that telleth them saith the lord

33:14 behold the day come saith the lord that i will perform that
good thing which i have promis unto the hous of israel and to the
hous of judah

33:15 in those day and at that time will i caus the branch of
righteous to grow up unto david; and he shall execut judgment and
righteous in the land

33:16 in those day shall judah be save and jerusalem shall dwell
safely: and thi is the name wherewith she shall be call the lord
our righteous

33:17 for thu saith the lord; david shall never want a man to sit
upon the throne of the hous of israel; 33:18 neither shall the
priest the levit want a man befor me to offer burnt offer and
to kindl meat offer and to do sacrific continu

33:19 and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah say 33:20 thu
saith the lord; if ye can break my coven of the day and my
coven of the night and that there should not be day and night in
their season; 33:21 then may also my coven be broken with david my
servant that he should not have a son to reign upon hi throne; and
with the levit the priest my minist

33:22 as the host of heaven cannot be number neither the sand of
the sea measured: so will i multipli the seed of david my servant and
the levit that minist unto me

33:23 moreov the word of the lord came to jeremiah say 33:24
considerest thou not what thi peopl have spoken say the two
famili which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off? thu
they have despis my peopl that they should be no more a nation
befor them

33:25 thu saith the lord; if my coven be not with day and night
and if i have not appoint the ordin of heaven and earth; 33:26
then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that
i will not take ani of hi seed to be ruler over the seed of abraham
isaac and jacob: for i will caus their captiv to return and have
merci on them

34:1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all hi armi and all the kingdom
of the earth of hi dominion and all the peopl fought against
jerusalem and against all the citi thereof say 34:2 thu saith
the lord the god of israel; go and speak to zedekiah king of judah
and tell him thu saith the lord; behold i will give thi citi into
the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire: 34:3
and thou shalt not escap out of hi hand but shalt sure be taken
and deliv into hi hand; and thine eye shall behold the eye of
the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and
thou shalt go to babylon

34:4 yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah; thu
saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword: 34:5 but thou
shalt die in peace: and with the burn of thi father the former
king which were befor thee so shall they burn odour for thee; and
they will lament thee say ah lord! for i have pronounc the
word saith the lord

34:6 then jeremiah the prophet spake all these word unto zedekiah
king of judah in jerusalem 34:7 when the king of babylon armi
fought against jerusalem and against all the citi of judah that
were left against lachish and against azekah: for these defenc
citi remain of the citi of judah

34:8 thi is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after
that the king zedekiah had made a coven with all the peopl which
were at jerusalem to proclaim liberti unto them; 34:9 that everi man
should let hi manserv and everi man hi maidserv be an
hebrew or an hebrewess go free; that none should serv himself of
them to wit of a jew hi brother

34:10 now when all the princ and all the peopl which had enter
into the coven heard that everi one should let hi manserv and
everi one hi maidserv go free that none should serv themselv
of them ani more then they obey and let them go

34:11 but afterward they turn and caus the servant and the
handmaid whom they had let go free to return and brought them into
subject for servant and for handmaid

34:12 therefor the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord
say 34:13 thu saith the lord the god of israel; i made a
coven with your father in the day that i brought them forth out of
the land of egypt out of the hous of bondmen say 34:14 at the
end of seven year let ye go everi man hi brother an hebrew which
hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath serv thee six year thou
shalt let him go free from thee: but your father hearken not unto
me neither inclin their ear

34:15 and ye were now turn and had done right in my sight in
proclaim liberti everi man to hi neighbour; and ye had made a
coven befor me in the hous which is call by my name: 34:16 but
ye turn and pollut my name and caus everi man hi servant and
everi man hi handmaid whom ye had set at liberti at their pleasur
to return and brought them into subject to be unto you for
servant and for handmaid

34:17 therefor thu saith the lord; ye have not hearken unto me in
proclaim liberti everi one to hi brother and everi man to hi
neighbour: behold i proclaim a liberti for you saith the lord to
the sword to the pestil and to the famine; and i will make you
to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth

34:18 and i will give the men that have transgress my coven
which have not perform the word of the coven which they had made
befor me when they cut the calf in twain and pass between the
part thereof 34:19 the princ of judah and the princ of
jerusalem the eunuch and the priest and all the peopl of the
land which pass between the part of the calf; 34:20 i will even
give them into the hand of their enemi and into the hand of them
that seek their life: and their dead bodi shall be for meat unto the
fowl of the heaven and to the beast of the earth

34:21 and zedekiah king of judah and hi princ will i give into the
hand of their enemi and into the hand of them that seek their life
and into the hand of the king of babylon armi which are gone up
from you

34:22 behold i will command saith the lord and caus them to return
to thi city; and they shall fight against it and take it and burn
it with fire: and i will make the citi of judah a desol without
an inhabit

35:1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the day of
jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah say 35:2 go unto the
hous of the rechabit and speak unto them and bring them into the
hous of the lord into one of the chamber and give them wine to
drink

35:3 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah
and hi brethren and all hi son and the whole hous of the
rechabites; 35:4 and i brought them into the hous of the lord into
the chamber of the son of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god
which wa by the chamber of the princ which wa abov the chamber
of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door: 35:5 and i set
befor the son of the hous of the rechabit pot full of wine and
cup and i said unto them drink ye wine

35:6 but they said we will drink no wine: for jonadab the son of
rechab our father command us say ye shall drink no wine
neither ye nor your son for ever: 35:7 neither shall ye build hous
nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any: but all your day ye
shall dwell in tents; that ye may live mani day in the land where ye
be stranger

35:8 thu have we obey the voic of jonadab the son of rechab our
father in all that he hath charg us to drink no wine all our day
we our wive our son nor our daughters; 35:9 nor to build hous
for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed:
35:10 but we have dwelt in tent and have obey and done accord
to all that jonadab our father command us

35:11 but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up
into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear
of the armi of the chaldean and for fear of the armi of the syrians:
so we dwell at jerusalem

35:12 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah say 35:13 thu
saith the lord of host the god of israel; go and tell the men of
judah and the inhabit of jerusalem will ye not receiv
instruct to hearken to my words? saith the lord

35:14 the word of jonadab the son of rechab that he command hi
son not to drink wine are performed; for unto thi day they drink
none but obey their father commandment: notwithstand i have
spoken unto you rise earli and speaking; but ye hearken not unto
me

35:15 i have sent also unto you all my servant the prophet rise
up earli and send them say return ye now everi man from hi
evil way and amend your do and go not after other god to serv
them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to
your fathers: but ye have not inclin your ear nor hearken unto
me

35:16 becaus the son of jonadab the son of rechab have perform the
command of their father which he command them; but thi peopl
hath not hearken unto me: 35:17 therefor thu saith the lord god of
host the god of israel; behold i will bring upon judah and upon all
the inhabit of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounc
against them: becaus i have spoken unto them but they have not
heard; and i have call unto them but they have not answer

35:18 and jeremiah said unto the hous of the rechabit thu saith
the lord of host the god of israel; becaus ye have obey the
command of jonadab your father and kept all hi precept and
done accord unto all that he hath command you: 35:19 therefor
thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; jonadab the son of
rechab shall not want a man to stand befor me for ever

36:1 and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah that thi word came unto jeremiah from the lord
say 36:2 take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the
word that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah
and against all the nation from the day i spake unto thee from the
day of josiah even unto thi day

36:3 it may be that the hous of judah will hear all the evil which i
purpos to do unto them; that they may return everi man from hi evil
way; that i may forgiv their iniqu and their sin

36:4 then jeremiah call baruch the son of neriah: and baruch wrote
from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the lord which he had
spoken unto him upon a roll of a book

36:5 and jeremiah command baruch say i am shut up; i cannot go
into the hous of the lord: 36:6 therefor go thou and read in the
roll which thou hast written from my mouth the word of the lord in
the ear of the peopl in the lord hous upon the fast day: and
also thou shalt read them in the ear of all judah that come out of
their citi

36:7 it may be they will present their supplic befor the lord
and will return everi one from hi evil way: for great is the anger
and the furi that the lord hath pronounc against thi peopl

36:8 and baruch the son of neriah did accord to all that jeremiah
the prophet command him read in the book the word of the lord
in the lord hous

36:9 and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaim a fast
befor the lord to all the peopl in jerusalem and to all the peopl
that came from the citi of judah unto jerusalem

36:10 then read baruch in the book the word of jeremiah in the hous
of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe
in the higher court at the entri of the new gate of the lord hous
in the ear of all the peopl

36:11 when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard
out of the book all the word of the lord 36:12 then he went down
into the king hous into the scribe chamber: and lo all the
princ sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of
shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of
shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princ

36:13 then michaiah declar unto them all the word that he had
heard when baruch read the book in the ear of the peopl

36:14 therefor all the princ sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the
son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch say take in thine
hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ear of the peopl and
come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in hi hand and came
unto them

36:15 and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ear
so baruch read it in their ear

36:16 now it came to pass when they had heard all the word they
were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will sure
tell the king of all these word

36:17 and they ask baruch say tell us now how didst thou write
all these word at hi mouth? 36:18 then baruch answer them he
pronounc all these word unto me with hi mouth and i wrote them
with ink in the book

36:19 then said the princ unto baruch go hide thee thou and
jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be

36:20 and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up
the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the word
in the ear of the king

36:21 so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
elishama the scribe chamber and jehudi read it in the ear of the
king and in the ear of all the princ which stood besid the king

36:22 now the king sat in the winterhous in the ninth month: and
there wa a fire on the hearth burn befor him

36:23 and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four
leav he cut it with the penknif and cast it into the fire that
wa on the hearth until all the roll wa consum in the fire that
wa on the hearth

36:24 yet they were not afraid nor rent their garment neither the
king nor ani of hi servant that heard all these word

36:25 nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made
intercess to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would
not hear them

36:26 but the king command jerahmeel the son of hammelech and
seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take
baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet: but the lord hid them

36:27 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king
had burn the roll and the word which baruch wrote at the mouth of
jeremiah say 36:28 take thee again anoth roll and write in it
all the former word that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the
king of judah hath burn

36:29 and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thu saith the
lord; thou hast burn thi roll say whi hast thou written
therein say the king of babylon shall certainli come and destroy
thi land and shall caus to ceas from thenc man and beast? 36:30
therefor thu saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah; he shall
have none to sit upon the throne of david: and hi dead bodi shall be
cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost

36:31 and i will punish him and hi seed and hi servant for their
iniquity; and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabit of
jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have
pronounc against them; but they hearken not

36:32 then took jeremiah anoth roll and gave it to baruch the
scribe the son of neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of
jeremiah all the word of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had
burn in the fire: and there were ad besid unto them mani like
word

37:1 and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the
son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the
land of judah

37:2 but neither he nor hi servant nor the peopl of the land did
hearken unto the word of the lord which he spake by the prophet
jeremiah

37:3 and zedekiah the king sent jehuc the son of shelemiah and
zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah
say pray now unto the lord our god for us

37:4 now jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had
not put him into prison

37:5 then pharaoh armi wa come forth out of egypt: and when the
chaldean that besieg jerusalem heard tide of them they depart
from jerusalem

37:6 then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah say
37:7 thu saith the lord the god of israel; thu shall ye say to the
king of judah that sent you unto me to enquir of me; behold
pharaoh armi which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt
into their own land

37:8 and the chaldean shall come again and fight against thi citi
and take it and burn it with fire

37:9 thu saith the lord; deceiv not yourselv say the
chaldean shall sure depart from us: for they shall not depart

37:10 for though ye had smitten the whole armi of the chaldean that
fight against you and there remain but wound men among them yet
should they rise up everi man in hi tent and burn thi citi with
fire

37:11 and it came to pass that when the armi of the chaldean wa
broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh armi 37:12 then
jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin
to separ himself thenc in the midst of the peopl

37:13 and when he wa in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward
wa there whose name wa irijah the son of shelemiah the son of
hananiah; and he took jeremiah the prophet say thou fallest away
to the chaldean

37:14 then said jeremiah it is false; i fall not away to the
chaldean

but he hearken not to him: so irijah took jeremiah and brought him
to the princ

37:15 wherefor the princ were wroth with jeremiah and smote him
and put him in prison in the hous of jonathan the scribe: for they
had made that the prison

37:16 when jeremiah wa enter into the dungeon and into the cabin
and jeremiah had remain there mani days; 37:17 then zedekiah the
king sent and took him out: and the king ask him secretli in hi
hous and said is there ani word from the lord? and jeremiah said
there is: for said he thou shalt be deliv into the hand of the
king of babylon

37:18 moreov jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offend
against thee or against thi servant or against thi peopl that ye
have put me in prison? 37:19 where are now your prophet which
prophesi unto you say the king of babylon shall not come
against you nor against thi land? 37:20 therefor hear now i pray
thee o my lord the king: let my supplic i pray thee be
accept befor thee; that thou caus me not to return to the hous of
jonathan the scribe lest i die there

37:21 then zedekiah the king command that they should commit
jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him
daili a piec of bread out of the baker street until all the bread
in the citi were spent

thu jeremiah remain in the court of the prison

38:1 then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of
pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of
malchiah heard the word that jeremiah had spoken unto all the
peopl say 38:2 thu saith the lord he that remaineth in thi
citi shall die by the sword by the famin and by the pestilence: but
he that goeth forth to the chaldean shall live; for he shall have hi
life for a prey and shall live

38:3 thu saith the lord thi citi shall sure be given into the
hand of the king of babylon armi which shall take it

38:4 therefor the princ said unto the king we beseech thee let
thi man be put to death: for thu he weakeneth the hand of the men
of war that remain in thi citi and the hand of all the peopl in
speak such word unto them: for thi man seeketh not the welfar of
thi peopl but the hurt

38:5 then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand: for the
king is not he that can do ani thing against you

38:6 then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of
malchiah the son of hammelech that wa in the court of the prison:
and they let down jeremiah with cord and in the dungeon there wa no
water but mire: so jeremiah sunk in the mire

38:7 now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuch which wa
in the king hous heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon;
the king then sit in the gate of benjamin; 38:8 ebedmelech went
forth out of the king hous and spake to the king say 38:9 my
lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to
jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is
like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more
bread in the citi

38:10 then the king command ebedmelech the ethiopian say take
from henc thirti men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out
of the dungeon befor he die

38:11 so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the hous of
the king under the treasuri and took thenc old cast clout and old
rotten rag and let them down by cord into the dungeon to jeremiah

38:12 and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these
old cast clout and rotten rag under thine armhol under the cord
and jeremiah did so

38:13 so they drew up jeremiah with cord and took him up out of the
dungeon: and jeremiah remain in the court of the prison

38:14 then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto
him into the third entri that is in the hous of the lord: and the
king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing; hide noth from
me

38:15 then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declar it unto thee
wilt thou not sure put me to death? and if i give thee counsel wilt
thou not hearken unto me? 38:16 so zedekiah the king sware secretli
unto jeremiah say as the lord liveth that made us thi soul i
will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of
these men that seek thi life

38:17 then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thu saith the lord the god
of host the god of israel; if thou wilt assuredli go forth unto the
king of babylon princ then thi soul shall live and thi citi
shall not be burn with fire; and thou shalt live and thine house:
38:18 but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon princ
then shall thi citi be given into the hand of the chaldean and they
shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escap out of their hand

38:19 and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the
jew that are fallen to the chaldean lest they deliv me into their
hand and they mock me

38:20 but jeremiah said they shall not deliv thee obey i beseech
thee the voic of the lord which i speak unto thee: so it shall be
well unto thee and thi soul shall live

38:21 but if thou refus to go forth thi is the word that the lord
hath shew me: 38:22 and behold all the women that are left in the
king of judah hous shall be brought forth to the king of babylon
princ and those women shall say thi friend have set thee on and
have prevail against thee: thi feet are sunk in the mire and they
are turn away back

38:23 so they shall bring out all thi wive and thi children to the
chaldeans: and thou shalt not escap out of their hand but shalt be
taken by the hand of the king of babylon: and thou shalt caus thi
citi to be burn with fire

38:24 then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these
word and thou shalt not die

38:25 but if the princ hear that i have talk with thee and they
come unto thee and say unto thee declar unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to
death; also what the king said unto thee: 38:26 then thou shalt say
unto them i present my supplic befor the king that he would
not caus me to return to jonathan hous to die there

38:27 then came all the princ unto jeremiah and ask him: and he
told them accord to all these word that the king had command so
they left off speak with him; for the matter wa not perceiv

38:28 so jeremiah abod in the court of the prison until the day that
jerusalem wa taken: and he wa there when jerusalem wa taken

39:1 in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month
came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all hi armi against
jerusalem and they besieg it

39:2 and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the
ninth day of the month the citi wa broken up

39:3 and all the princ of the king of babylon came in and sat in
the middl gate even nergalsharez samgarnebo sarsechim rabsari
nergalsharez rabmag with all the residu of the princ of the
king of babylon

39:4 and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw
them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of
the citi by night by the way of the king garden by the gate
betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain

39:5 but the chaldean armi pursu after them and overtook zedekiah
in the plain of jericho: and when they had taken him they brought
him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of
hamath where he gave judgment upon him

39:6 then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah
befor hi eyes: also the king of babylon slew all the nobl of
judah

39:7 moreov he put out zedekiah eye and bound him with chain
to carri him to babylon

39:8 and the chaldean burn the king hous and the hous of the
peopl with fire and brake down the wall of jerusalem

39:9 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carri away captiv
into babylon the remnant of the peopl that remain in the citi and
those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the peopl
that remain

39:10 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
peopl which had noth in the land of judah and gave them
vineyard and field at the same time

39:11 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charg concern
jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard say 39:12 take
him and look well to him and do him no harm; but do unto him even as
he shall say unto thee

39:13 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban
rabsari and nergalsharez rabmag and all the king of babylon
princes; 39:14 even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of
the prison and commit him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son
of shaphan that he should carri him home: so he dwelt among the
peopl

39:15 now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he wa shut
up in the court of the prison say 39:16 go and speak to
ebedmelech the ethiopian say thu saith the lord of host the
god of israel; behold i will bring my word upon thi citi for evil
and not for good; and they shall be accomplish in that day befor
thee

39:17 but i will deliv thee in that day saith the lord: and thou
shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid

39:18 for i will sure deliv thee and thou shalt not fall by the
sword but thi life shall be for a prey unto thee: becaus thou hast
put thi trust in me saith the lord

40:1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when
he had taken him be bound in chain among all that were carri
away captiv of jerusalem and judah which were carri away captiv
unto babylon

40:2 and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him
the lord thi god hath pronounc thi evil upon thi place

40:3 now the lord hath brought it and done accord as he hath said:
becaus ye have sin against the lord and have not obey hi
voic therefor thi thing is come upon you

40:4 and now behold i loos thee thi day from the chain which were
upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into
babylon come; and i will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto
thee to come with me into babylon forbear: behold all the land is
befor thee: whither it seemeth good and conveni for thee to go
thither go

40:5 now while he wa not yet gone back he said go back also to
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of
babylon hath made governor over the citi of judah and dwell with
him among the people: or go wheresoev it seemeth conveni unto
thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victual and a
reward and let him go

40:6 then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah; and
dwelt with him among the peopl that were left in the land

40:7 now when all the captain of the forc which were in the field
even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made
gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had commit
unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of
them that were not carri away captiv to babylon; 40:8 then they
came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and
johanan and jonathan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of
tanhumeth and the son of ephai the netophathit and jezaniah the
son of a maachathit they and their men

40:9 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them
and to their men say fear not to serv the chaldeans: dwell in
the land and serv the king of babylon and it shall be well with
you

40:10 as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serv the
chaldean which will come unto us: but ye gather ye wine and summer
fruit and oil and put them in your vessel and dwell in your
citi that ye have taken

40:11 likewis when all the jew that were in moab and among the
ammonit and in edom and that were in all the countri heard that
the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set
over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan; 40:12 even
all the jew return out of all place whither they were driven and
came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gather wine
and summer fruit veri much

40:13 moreov johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the
forc that were in the field came to gedaliah to mizpah 40:14 and
said unto him dost thou certainli know that baali the king of the
ammonit hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee? but
gedaliah the son of ahikam believ them not

40:15 then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah
secretli say let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the
son of nethaniah and no man shall know it: wherefor should he slay
thee that all the jew which are gather unto thee should be
scatter and the remnant in judah perish? 40:16 but gedaliah the
son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do
thi thing: for thou speakest fals of ishmael

41:1 now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of
nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princ of
the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam
to mizpah; and there they did eat bread togeth in mizpah

41:2 then aros ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that
were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made
governor over the land

41:3 ishmael also slew all the jew that were with him even with
gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldean that were found there and the
men of war

41:4 and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah
and no man knew it 41:5 that there came certain from shechem from
shiloh and from samaria even fourscor men have their beard
shaven and their cloth rent and have cut themselv with
offer and incens in their hand to bring them to the hous of the
lord

41:6 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet
them weep all along as he went: and it came to pass as he met
them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam

41:7 and it wa so when they came into the midst of the citi that
ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst
of the pit he and the men that were with him

41:8 but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us
not: for we have treasur in the field of wheat and of barley and
of oil and of honey so he forbar and slew them not among their
brethren

41:9 now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodi of the
men whom he had slain becaus of gedaliah wa it which asa the king
had made for fear of baasha king of israel: and ishmael the son of
nethaniah fill it with them that were slain

41:10 then ishmael carri away captiv all the residu of the peopl
that were in mizpah even the king daughter and all the peopl
that remain in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam: and ishmael the son of
nethaniah carri them away captiv and depart to go over to the
ammonit

41:11 but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the
forc that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son
of nethaniah had done 41:12 then they took all the men and went to
fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great
water that are in gibeon

41:13 now it came to pass that when all the peopl which were with
ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the
forc that were with him then they were glad

41:14 so all the peopl that ishmael had carri away captiv from
mizpah cast about and return and went unto johanan the son of
kareah

41:15 but ishmael the son of nethaniah escap from johanan with eight
men and went to the ammonit

41:16 then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the
forc that were with him all the remnant of the peopl whom he had
recov from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that
he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighti men of war and
the women and the children and the eunuch whom he had brought
again from gibeon: 41:17 and they depart and dwelt in the
habit of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into
egypt 41:18 becaus of the chaldeans: for they were afraid of them
becaus ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of
ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land

42:1 then all the captain of the forc and johanan the son of
kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the peopl from the
least even unto the greatest came near 42:2 and said unto jeremiah
the prophet let we beseech thee our supplic be accept befor
thee and pray for us unto the lord thi god even for all thi
remnant; (for we are left but a few of mani as thine eye do behold
us:) 42:3 that the lord thi god may shew us the way wherein we may
walk and the thing that we may do

42:4 then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you;
behold i will pray unto the lord your god accord to your words;
and it shall come to pass that whatsoev thing the lord shall answer
you i will declar it unto you; i will keep noth back from you

42:5 then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faith
wit between us if we do not even accord to all thing for the
which the lord thi god shall send thee to us

42:6 whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voic
of the lord our god to whom we send thee; that it may be well with
us when we obey the voic of the lord our god

42:7 and it came to pass after ten day that the word of the lord
came unto jeremiah

42:8 then call he johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of
the forc which were with him and all the peopl from the least even
to the greatest 42:9 and said unto them thu saith the lord the god
of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplic befor
him; 42:10 if ye will still abid in thi land then will i build you
and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up: for
i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you

42:11 be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid; be
not afraid of him saith the lord: for i am with you to save you and
to deliv you from hi hand

42:12 and i will shew merci unto you that he may have merci upon
you and caus you to return to your own land

42:13 but if ye say we will not dwell in thi land neither obey the
voic of the lord your god 42:14 say no; but we will go into the
land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the
trumpet nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 42:15 and
now therefor hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah; thu
saith the lord of host the god of israel; if ye wholli set your
face to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there; 42:16 then it
shall come to pass that the sword which ye fear shall overtak
you there in the land of egypt and the famin whereof ye were
afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt; and there ye
shall die

42:17 so shall it be with all the men that set their face to go into
egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword by the famin
and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escap from
the evil that i will bring upon them

42:18 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; as mine
anger and my furi hath been pour forth upon the inhabit of
jerusalem; so shall my furi be pour forth upon you when ye shall
enter into egypt: and ye shall be an execr and an astonish
and a curs and a reproach; and ye shall see thi place no more

42:19 the lord hath said concern you o ye remnant of judah; go ye
not into egypt: know certainli that i have admonish you thi day

42:20 for ye dissembl in your heart when ye sent me unto the lord
your god say pray for us unto the lord our god; and accord
unto all that the lord our god shall say so declar unto us and we
will do it

42:21 and now i have thi day declar it to you; but ye have not
obey the voic of the lord your god nor ani thing for the which he
hath sent me unto you

42:22 now therefor know certainli that ye shall die by the sword by
the famin and by the pestil in the place whither ye desir to
go and to sojourn

43:1 and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of
speak unto all the peopl all the word of the lord their god for
which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these word
43:2 then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of
kareah and all the proud men say unto jeremiah thou speakest
falsely: the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt
to sojourn there: 43:3 but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on
against us for to deliv us into the hand of the chaldean that
they might put us to death and carri us away captiv into babylon

43:4 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc
and all the peopl obey not the voic of the lord to dwell in the
land of judah

43:5 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the
forc took all the remnant of judah that were return from all
nation whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah;
43:6 even men and women and children and the king daughter and
everi person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the
prophet and baruch the son of neriah

43:7 so they came into the land of egypt: for they obey not the
voic of the lord: thu came they even to tahpanh

43:8 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanh
say 43:9 take great stone in thine hand and hide them in the
clay in the brickkiln which is at the entri of pharaoh hous in
tahpanh in the sight of the men of judah; 43:10 and say unto them
thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; behold i will send
and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set
hi throne upon these stone that i have hid; and he shall spread hi
royal pavilion over them

43:11 and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and
deliv such as are for death to death; and such as are for captiv
to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword

43:12 and i will kindl a fire in the hous of the god of egypt; and
he shall burn them and carri them away captives: and he shall array
himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on hi garment;
and he shall go forth from thenc in peac

43:13 he shall break also the imag of bethshemesh that is in the
land of egypt; and the hous of the god of the egyptian shall he
burn with fire

44:1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the jew which
dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanh
and at noph and in the countri of pathro say 44:2 thu saith
the lord of host the god of israel; ye have seen all the evil that i
have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the citi of judah; and
behold thi day they are a desol and no man dwelleth therein
44:3 becaus of their wicked which they have commit to provok
me to anger in that they went to burn incens and to serv other
god whom they knew not neither they ye nor your father

44:4 howbeit i sent unto you all my servant the prophet rise
earli and send them say oh do not thi abomin thing that
i hate

44:5 but they hearken not nor inclin their ear to turn from their
wicked to burn no incens unto other god

44:6 wherefor my furi and mine anger wa pour forth and wa
kindl in the citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem; and
they are wast and desol as at thi day

44:7 therefor now thu saith the lord the god of host the god of
israel; wherefor commit ye thi great evil against your soul to cut
off from you man and woman child and suckl out of judah to leav
you none to remain; 44:8 in that ye provok me unto wrath with the
work of your hand burn incens unto other god in the land of
egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselv off
and that ye might be a curs and a reproach among all the nation of
the earth? 44:9 have ye forgotten the wicked of your father and
the wicked of the king of judah and the wicked of their
wive and your own wicked and the wicked of your wive
which they have commit in the land of judah and in the street of
jerusalem? 44:10 they are not humbl even unto thi day neither
have they fear nor walk in my law nor in my statut that i set
befor you and befor your father

44:11 therefor thu saith the lord of host the god of israel;
behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all
judah

44:12 and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their face
to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be
consum and fall in the land of egypt; they shall even be consum
by the sword and by the famine: they shall die from the least even
unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be
an execr and an astonish and a curs and a reproach

44:13 for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i
have punish jerusalem by the sword by the famin and by the
pestilence: 44:14 so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone
into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escap or remain that
they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a
desir to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as
shall escap

44:15 then all the men which knew that their wive had burn incens
unto other god and all the women that stood by a great multitud
even all the peopl that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathro
answer jeremiah say 44:16 as for the word that thou hast spoken
unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee

44:17 but we will certainli do whatsoev thing goeth forth out of our
own mouth to burn incens unto the queen of heaven and to pour out
drink offer unto her as we have done we and our father our
king and our princ in the citi of judah and in the street of
jerusalem: for then had we plenti of victual and were well and saw
no evil

44:18 but sinc we left off to burn incens to the queen of heaven
and to pour out drink offer unto her we have want all thing
and have been consum by the sword and by the famin

44:19 and when we burn incens to the queen of heaven and pour
out drink offer unto her did we make her cake to worship her
and pour out drink offer unto her without our men? 44:20 then
jeremiah said unto all the peopl to the men and to the women and
to all the peopl which had given him that answer say 44:21 the
incens that ye burn in the citi of judah and in the street of
jerusalem ye and your father your king and your princ and the
peopl of the land did not the lord rememb them and came it not
into hi mind? 44:22 so that the lord could no longer bear becaus
of the evil of your do and becaus of the abomin which ye
have committed; therefor is your land a desol and an
astonish and a curs without an inhabit as at thi day

44:23 becaus ye have burn incens and becaus ye have sin
against the lord and have not obey the voic of the lord nor
walk in hi law nor in hi statut nor in hi testimonies;
therefor thi evil is happen unto you as at thi day

44:24 moreov jeremiah said unto all the peopl and to all the
women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of
egypt: 44:25 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel saying;
ye and your wive have both spoken with your mouth and fulfil
with your hand say we will sure perform our vow that we have
vow to burn incens to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink
offer unto her: ye will sure accomplish your vow and sure
perform your vow

44:26 therefor hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in
the land of egypt; behold i have sworn by my great name saith the
lord that my name shall no more be name in the mouth of ani man of
judah in all the land of egypt say the lord god liveth

44:27 behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good: and
all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consum
by the sword and by the famin until there be an end of them

44:28 yet a small number that escap the sword shall return out of the
land of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judah
that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know
whose word shall stand mine or their

44:29 and thi shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i will

stand against you for evil: 44:30 thu saith the lord; behold i will
give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of hi enemi and
into the hand of them that seek hi life; as i gave zedekiah king of
judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hi enemi and
that sought hi life

neriah when he had written these word in a book at the mouth of
jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of
judah say 45:2 thu saith the lord the god of israel unto thee
o baruch: 45:3 thou didst say woe is me now! for the lord hath ad
grief to my sorrow; i faint in my sigh and i find no rest

45:4 thu shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus; behold that
which i have built will i break down and that which i have plant i
will pluck up even thi whole land

45:5 and seekest thou great thing for thyself? seek them not: for
behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord: but thi life
will i give unto thee for a prey in all place whither thou goest

46:1 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against
the gentiles; 46:2 against egypt against the armi of pharaohnecho
king of egypt which wa by the river euphrat in carchemish which
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim
the son of josiah king of judah

46:3 order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battl

46:4 har the horses; and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with

46:5 wherefor have i seen them dismay and turn away back? and
their mighti one are beaten down and are fled apac and look not

46:6 let not the swift flee away nor the mighti man escape; they
shall stumbl and fall toward the north by the river euphrat

46:7 who is thi that cometh up as a flood whose water are move as
the rivers? 46:8 egypt riseth up like a flood and hi water are
move like the rivers; and he saith i will go up and will cover the
earth; i will destroy the citi and the inhabit thereof

46:9 come up ye horses; and rage ye chariots; and let the mighti men

and the lydian that handl and bend the bow

46:10 for thi is the day of the lord god of host a day of
vengeanc that he may aveng him of hi adversaries: and the sword

for the lord god of host hath a sacrific in the north countri by the
river euphrat

46:11 go up into gilead and take balm o virgin the daughter of
egypt: in vain shalt thou use mani medicines; for thou shalt not be

egypt

46:14 declar ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in noph
and in tahpanhes: say ye stand fast and prepar thee; for the sword
shall devour round about thee

46:15 whi are thi valiant men swept away? they stood not becaus the
lord did drive them

46:16 he made mani to fall yea one fell upon another: and they said
aris and let us go again to our own peopl and to the land of our
nativ from the oppress sword

46:17 they did cri there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise; he
hath pass the time appoint

46:18 as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of host
sure as tabor is among the mountain and as carmel by the sea so

46:19 o thou daughter dwell in egypt furnish thyself to go into
captivity: for noph shall be wast and desol without an inhabit

46:20 egypt is like a veri fair heifer but destruct cometh; it
cometh out of the north

46:21 also her hire men are in the midst of her like fat bullocks;
for they also are turn back and are fled away together: they did
not stand becaus the day of their calam wa come upon them and
the time of their visit

46:22 the voic thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march
with an armi and come against her with axe as hewer of wood

46:23 they shall cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot
be searched; becaus they are more than the grasshopp and are
innumer

46:24 the daughter of egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
deliv into the hand of the peopl of the north

46:25 the lord of host the god of israel saith; behold i will
punish the multitud of no and pharaoh and egypt with their god
and their kings; even pharaoh and all them that trust in him: 46:26
and i will deliv them into the hand of those that seek their live

thee; for i will make a full end of all the nation whither i have
driven thee: but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee
in measure; yet will i not leav thee wholli unpunish

47:1 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against
the philistin befor that pharaoh smote gaza

47:2 thu saith the lord; behold water rise up out of the north and
shall be an overflow flood and shall overflow the land and all
that is therein; the citi and them that dwell therein: then the men
shall cri and all the inhabit of the land shall howl

47:3 at the nois of the stamp of the hoof of hi strong hors
at the rush of hi chariot and at the rumbl of hi wheel the
father shall not look back to their children for feebl of hands;
47:4 becaus of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistin and
to cut off from tyru and zidon everi helper that remaineth: for the
lord will spoil the philistin the remnant of the countri of
caphtor

47:5 bald is come upon gaza; ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 47:6 o thou sword of
the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into
thi scabbard rest and be still

47:7 how can it be quiet see the lord hath given it a charg
against ashkelon and against the sea shore? there hath he appoint
it

48:1 against moab thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; woe
unto nebo! for it is spoiled: kiriathaim is confound and taken:
misgab is confound and dismay

48:2 there shall be no more prais of moab: in heshbon they have
devis evil against it; come and let us cut it off from be a
nation also thou shalt be cut down o madmen; the sword shall pursu
thee

48:3 a voic of cri shall be from horonaim spoil and great
destruct

48:4 moab is destroyed; her littl one have caus a cri to be heard

48:5 for in the go up of luhith continu weep shall go up; for
in the go down of horonaim the enemi have heard a cri of
destruct

48:6 flee save your live and be like the heath in the wilder

48:7 for becaus thou hast trust in thi work and in thi treasur
thou shalt also be taken: and chemosh shall go forth into captiv
with hi priest and hi princ togeth

48:8 and the spoiler shall come upon everi citi and no citi shall
escape: the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be
destroy as the lord hath spoken

48:9 give wing unto moab that it may flee and get away: for the
citi thereof shall be desol without ani to dwell therein

48:10 curs be he that doeth the work of the lord deceit and
curs be he that keepeth back hi sword from blood

48:11 moab hath been at eas from hi youth and he hath settl on
hi lee and hath not been empti from vessel to vessel neither
hath he gone into captivity: therefor hi tast remain in him and
hi scent is not chang

48:12 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that i will
send unto him wander that shall caus him to wander and shall
empti hi vessel and break their bottl

48:13 and moab shall be asham of chemosh as the hous of israel wa
asham of bethel their confid

48:14 how say ye we are mighti and strong men for the war? 48:15
moab is spoil and gone up out of her citi and hi chosen young
men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the
lord of host

48:16 the calam of moab is near to come and hi afflict hasteth
fast

48:17 all ye that are about him bemoan him; and all ye that know hi
name say how is the strong staff broken and the beauti rod!
48:18 thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon come down from thi glori
and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee and
he shall destroy thi strong hold

48:19 o inhabit of aroer stand by the way and espy; ask him that
fleeth and her that escapeth and say what is done? 48:20 moab is
confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in arnon
that moab is spoil 48:21 and judgment is come upon the plain
country; upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath 48:22 and
upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim 48:23 and upon
kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon 48:24 and upon
kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the citi of the land of moab
far or near

48:25 the horn of moab is cut off and hi arm is broken saith the
lord

48:26 make ye him drunken: for he magnifi himself against the lord:
moab also shall wallow in hi vomit and he also shall be in deris

48:27 for wa not israel a deris unto thee? wa he found among
thieves? for sinc thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy

48:28 o ye that dwell in moab leav the citi and dwell in the
rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the side of the
hole mouth

48:29 we have heard the pride of moab (he is exceed proud) hi
lofti and hi arrog and hi pride and the haughti of
hi heart

48:30 i know hi wrath saith the lord; but it shall not be so; hi
lie shall not so effect it

48:31 therefor will i howl for moab and i will cri out for all moab;
mine heart shall mourn for the men of kirher

48:32 o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weep of
jazer: thi plant are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of
jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thi summer fruit and upon thi
vintag

48:33 and joy and glad is taken from the plenti field and from
the land of moab and i have caus wine to fail from the winepresses:
none shall tread with shouting; their shout shall be no shout

48:34 from the cri of heshbon even unto elealeh and even unto jahaz
have they utter their voic from zoar even unto horonaim as an
heifer of three year old: for the water also of nimrim shall be
desol

48:35 moreov i will caus to ceas in moab saith the lord him that
offereth in the high place and him that burneth incens to hi god

48:36 therefor mine heart shall sound for moab like pipe and mine
heart shall sound like pipe for the men of kirheres: becaus the
rich that he hath gotten are perish

48:37 for everi head shall be bald and everi beard clipped: upon all
the hand shall be cut and upon the loin sackcloth

48:38 there shall be lament gener upon all the housetop of
moab and in the street thereof: for i have broken moab like a vessel
wherein is no pleasur saith the lord

48:39 they shall howl say how is it broken down! how hath moab
turn the back with shame! so shall moab be a deris and a
dismay to all them about him

48:40 for thu saith the lord; behold he shall fli as an eagl and
shall spread hi wing over moab

48:41 kerioth is taken and the strong hold are surpris and the
mighti men heart in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a
woman in her pang

48:42 and moab shall be destroy from be a peopl becaus he hath
magnifi himself against the lord

48:43 fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee o
inhabit of moab saith the lord

48:44 he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for i will
bring upon it even upon moab the year of their visit saith the
lord

48:45 they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon becaus of the
force: but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from
the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown
of the head of the tumultu one

48:46 woe be unto thee o moab! the peopl of chemosh perisheth: for
thi son are taken captiv and thi daughter captiv

48:47 yet will i bring again the captiv of moab in the latter day
saith the lord thu far is the judgment of moab

49:1 concern the ammonit thu saith the lord; hath israel no
sons? hath he no heir? whi then doth their king inherit gad and hi
peopl dwell in hi cities? 49:2 therefor behold the day come
saith the lord that i will caus an alarm of war to be heard in
rabbah of the ammonites; and it shall be a desol heap and her
daughter shall be burn with fire: then shall israel be heir unto
them that were hi heir saith the lord

49:3 howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled: cri ye daughter of rabbah
gird you with sackcloth; lament and run to and fro by the hedges; for
their king shall go into captiv and hi priest and hi princ
togeth

49:4 wherefor gloriest thou in the valley thi flow valley o
backslid daughter? that trust in her treasur say who shall
come unto me? 49:5 behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the
lord god of host from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be
driven out everi man right forth; and none shall gather up him that
wandereth

49:6 and afterward i will bring again the captiv of the children of
ammon saith the lord

49:7 concern edom thu saith the lord of hosts; is wisdom no more
in teman? is counsel perish from the prudent? is their wisdom
vanished? 49:8 flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabit of
dedan; for i will bring the calam of esau upon him the time that i
will visit him

49:9 if grapegather come to thee would they not leav some
glean grapes? if thiev by night they will destroy till they have
enough

49:10 but i have made esau bare i have uncov hi secret place
and he shall not be abl to hide himself: hi seed is spoil and hi
brethren and hi neighbour and he is not

49:11 leav thi fatherless children i will preserv them alive; and
let thi widow trust in me

49:12 for thu saith the lord; behold they whose judgment wa not to
drink of the cup have assuredli drunken; and art thou he that shall
altogeth go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunish but thou shalt
sure drink of it

49:13 for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall
becom a desol a reproach a wast and a curse; and all the
citi thereof shall be perpetu wast

49:14 i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent
unto the heathen say gather ye togeth and come against her
and rise up to the battl

49:15 for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despis
among men

49:16 thi terribl hath deceiv thee and the pride of thine
heart o thou that dwellest in the cleft of the rock that holdest
the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thi nest as high as
the eagl i will bring thee down from thenc saith the lord

49:17 also edom shall be a desolation: everi one that goeth by it
shall be astonish and shall hiss at all the plagu thereof

49:18 as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour
citi thereof saith the lord no man shall abid there neither
shall a son of man dwell in it

49:19 behold he shall come up like a lion from the swell of jordan
against the habit of the strong: but i will suddenli make him run
away from her: and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand befor me? 49:20 therefor hear the counsel
of the lord that he hath taken against edom; and hi purpos that
he hath purpos against the inhabit of teman: sure the least of
the flock shall draw them out: sure he shall make their habit
desol with them

49:21 the earth is move at the nois of their fall at the cri the
nois thereof wa heard in the red sea

49:22 behold he shall come up and fli as the eagl and spread hi
wing over bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighti men
of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pang

49:23 concern damascu hamath is confound and arpad: for they
have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the
sea; it cannot be quiet

49:24 damascu is wax feebl and turneth herself to flee and fear
hath seiz on her: anguish and sorrow have taken her as a woman in
travail

49:25 how is the citi of prais not left the citi of my joy! 49:26
therefor her young men shall fall in her street and all the men of
war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of host

49:27 and i will kindl a fire in the wall of damascu and it shall
consum the palac of benhadad

49:28 concern kedar and concern the kingdom of hazor which
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite thu saith the lord; aris
ye go up to kedar and spoil the men of the east

49:29 their tent and their flock shall they take away: they shall
take to themselv their curtain and all their vessel and their
camels; and they shall cri unto them fear is on everi side

49:30 flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabit of hazor
saith the lord; for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel
against you and hath conceiv a purpos against you

49:31 aris get you up unto the wealthi nation that dwelleth without
care saith the lord which have neither gate nor bar which dwell
alon

49:32 and their camel shall be a booti and the multitud of their
cattl a spoil: and i will scatter into all wind them that are in the
utmost corners; and i will bring their calam from all side
thereof saith the lord

49:33 and hazor shall be a dwell for dragon and a desol for
ever: there shall no man abid there nor ani son of man dwell in it

49:34 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against
elam in the begin of the reign of zedekiah king of judah say
49:35 thu saith the lord of hosts; behold i will break the bow of
elam the chief of their might

49:36 and upon elam will i bring the four wind from the four quarter
of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there
shall be no nation whither the outcast of elam shall not come

49:37 for i will caus elam to be dismay befor their enemi and
befor them that seek their life: and i will bring evil upon them
even my fierc anger saith the lord; and i will send the sword after
them till i have consum them: 49:38 and i will set my throne in
elam and will destroy from thenc the king and the princ saith the
lord

49:39 but it shall come to pass in the latter day that i will bring
again the captiv of elam saith the lord

50:1 the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land
of the chaldean by jeremiah the prophet

50:2 declar ye among the nation and publish and set up a standard;
publish and conceal not: say babylon is taken bel is confound
merodach is broken in pieces; her idol are confound her imag are
broken in piec

50:3 for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which
shall make her land desol and none shall dwell therein: they shall
remov they shall depart both man and beast

50:4 in those day and in that time saith the lord the children of
israel shall come they and the children of judah togeth go and
weeping: they shall go and seek the lord their god

50:5 they shall ask the way to zion with their face thitherward
say come and let us join ourselv to the lord in a perpetu
coven that shall not be forgotten

50:6 my peopl hath been lost sheep: their shepherd have caus them
to go astray they have turn them away on the mountains: they have
gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplac

50:7 all that found them have devour them: and their adversari
said we offend not becaus they have sin against the lord the
habit of justic even the lord the hope of their father

50:8 remov out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land
of the chaldean and be as the he goat befor the flock

50:9 for lo i will rais and caus to come up against babylon an
assembl of great nation from the north country: and they shall set
themselv in array against her; from thenc she shall be taken: their
arrow shall be as of a mighti expert man; none shall return in vain

50:10 and chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
satisfi saith the lord

50:11 becaus ye were glad becaus ye rejoic o ye destroy of
mine heritag becaus ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and
bellow as bulls; 50:12 your mother shall be sore confounded; she that
bare you shall be ashamed: behold the hindermost of the nation shall
be a wilder a dri land and a desert

50:13 becaus of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabit but
it shall be wholli desolate: everi one that goeth by babylon shall be
astonish and hiss at all her plagu

50:14 put yourselv in array against babylon round about: all ye that
bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows: for she hath sin
against the lord

50:15 shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
foundat are fallen her wall are thrown down: for it is the
vengeanc of the lord: take vengeanc upon her; as she hath done do
unto her

50:16 cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickl
in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppress sword they shall
turn everi one to hi peopl and they shall flee everi one to hi own
land

50:17 israel is a scatter sheep; the lion have driven him away:
first the king of assyria hath devour him; and last thi
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken hi bone

50:18 therefor thu saith the lord of host the god of israel;
behold i will punish the king of babylon and hi land as i have
punish the king of assyria

50:19 and i will bring israel again to hi habit and he shall
feed on carmel and bashan and hi soul shall be satisfi upon mount
ephraim and gilead

50:20 in those day and in that time saith the lord the iniqu of
israel shall be sought for and there shall be none; and the sin of
judah and they shall not be found: for i will pardon them whom i
reserv

50:21 go up against the land of merathaim even against it and
against the inhabit of pekod: wast and utterli destroy after
them saith the lord and do accord to all that i have command
thee

50:22 a sound of battl is in the land and of great destruct

50:23 how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asund and broken! how
is babylon becom a desol among the nations! 50:24 i have laid a
snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not
aware: thou art found and also caught becaus thou hast striven
against the lord

50:25 the lord hath open hi armouri and hath brought forth the
weapon of hi indignation: for thi is the work of the lord god of
host in the land of the chaldean

50:26 come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses:
cast her up as heap and destroy her utterly: let noth of her be
left

50:27 slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
unto them! for their day is come the time of their visit

50:28 the voic of them that flee and escap out of the land of
babylon to declar in zion the vengeanc of the lord our god the
vengeanc of hi templ

50:29 call togeth the archer against babylon: all ye that bend the
bow camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompens
her accord to her work; accord to all that she hath done do
unto her: for she hath been proud against the lord against the holi
one of israel

50:30 therefor shall her young men fall in the street and all her
men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord

50:31 behold i am against thee o thou most proud saith the lord god
of hosts: for thi day is come the time that i will visit thee

50:32 and the most proud shall stumbl and fall and none shall rais
him up: and i will kindl a fire in hi citi and it shall devour
all round about him

50:33 thu saith the lord of hosts; the children of israel and the
children of judah were oppress together: and all that took them
captiv held them fast; they refus to let them go

50:34 their redeem is strong; the lord of host is hi name: he
shall throughli plead their caus that he may give rest to the land
and disquiet the inhabit of babylon

50:35 a sword is upon the chaldean saith the lord and upon the
inhabit of babylon and upon her princ and upon her wise men

50:36 a sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon
her mighti men; and they shall be dismay

50:37 a sword is upon their hors and upon their chariot and upon
all the mingl peopl that are in the midst of her; and they shall
becom as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be
rob

50:38 a drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dri up: for it
is the land of graven imag and they are mad upon their idol

50:39 therefor the wild beast of the desert with the wild beast of
the island shall dwell there and the owl shall dwell therein: and
it shall be no more inhabit for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in
from gener to gener

50:40 as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour citi
thereof saith the lord; so shall no man abid there neither shall
ani son of man dwell therein

50:41 behold a peopl shall come from the north and a great nation
and mani king shall be rais up from the coast of the earth

50:42 they shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel and will
not shew mercy: their voic shall roar like the sea and they shall
ride upon hors everi one put in array like a man to the battl
against thee o daughter of babylon

50:43 the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and hi hand
wax feeble: anguish took hold of him and pang as of a woman in
travail

50:44 behold he shall come up like a lion from the swell of jordan
unto the habit of the strong: but i will make them suddenli run
away from her: and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand befor me? 50:45 therefor hear ye the
counsel of the lord that he hath taken against babylon; and hi
purpos that he hath purpos against the land of the chaldeans:
sure the least of the flock shall draw them out: sure he shall
make their habit desol with them

50:46 at the nois of the take of babylon the earth is move and
the cri is heard among the nation

51:1 thu saith the lord; behold i will rais up against babylon and
against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me
a destroy wind; 51:2 and will send unto babylon fanner that shall
fan her and shall empti her land: for in the day of troubl they
shall be against her round about

51:3 against him that bendeth let the archer bend hi bow and against
him that lifteth himself up in hi brigandine: and spare ye not her
young men; destroy ye utterli all her host

51:4 thu the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldean and they
that are thrust through in her street

51:5 for israel hath not been forsaken nor judah of hi god of the
lord of hosts; though their land wa fill with sin against the holi
one of israel

51:6 flee out of the midst of babylon and deliv everi man hi soul:
be not cut off in her iniquity; for thi is the time of the lord
vengeance; he will render unto her a recomp

51:7 babylon hath been a golden cup in the lord hand that made all
the earth drunken: the nation have drunken of her wine; therefor the
nation are mad

51:8 babylon is suddenli fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm
for her pain if so be she may be heal

51:9 we would have heal babylon but she is not healed: forsak her
and let us go everi one into hi own country: for her judgment
reacheth unto heaven and is lift up even to the sky

51:10 the lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come and let us
declar in zion the work of the lord our god

51:11 make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the lord hath rais
up the spirit of the king of the medes: for hi devic is against
babylon to destroy it; becaus it is the vengeanc of the lord the
vengeanc of hi templ

51:12 set up the standard upon the wall of babylon make the watch
strong set up the watchmen prepar the ambushes: for the lord hath
both devis and done that which he spake against the inhabit of
babylon

51:13 o thou that dwellest upon mani water abund in treasur
thine end is come and the measur of thi covet

51:14 the lord of host hath sworn by himself say sure i will
fill thee with men as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a
shout against thee

51:15 he hath made the earth by hi power he hath establish the
world by hi wisdom and hath stretch out the heaven by hi
understand

51:16 when he uttereth hi voic there is a multitud of water in
the heavens; and he causeth the vapour to ascend from the end of the
earth: he maketh lightn with rain and bringeth forth the wind out
of hi treasur

51:17 everi man is brutish by hi knowledge; everi founder is
confound by the graven image: for hi molten imag is falsehood and
there is no breath in them

51:18 they are vaniti the work of errors: in the time of their
visit they shall perish

51:19 the portion of jacob is not like them; for he is the former of
all things: and israel is the rod of hi inheritance: the lord of
host is hi name

51:20 thou art my battl axe and weapon of war: for with thee will i
break in piec the nation and with thee will i destroy kingdoms;
51:21 and with thee will i break in piec the hors and hi rider;
and with thee will i break in piec the chariot and hi rider; 51:22
with thee also will i break in piec man and woman; and with thee
will i break in piec old and young; and with thee will i break in
piec the young man and the maid; 51:23 i will also break in piec
with thee the shepherd and hi flock; and with thee will i break in
piec the husbandman and hi yoke of oxen; and with thee will i break
in piec captain and ruler

51:24 and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabit of
chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight
saith the lord

51:25 behold i am against thee o destroy mountain saith the
lord which destroyest all the earth: and i will stretch out mine hand
upon thee and roll thee down from the rock and will make thee a
burnt mountain

51:26 and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a
stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desol for ever saith the
lord

51:27 set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the
nation prepar the nation against her call togeth against her
the kingdom of ararat minni and ashchenaz; appoint a captain
against her; caus the hors to come up as the rough caterpil

51:28 prepar against her the nation with the king of the mede the
captain thereof and all the ruler thereof and all the land of hi
dominion

51:29 and the land shall trembl and sorrow: for everi purpos of the
lord shall be perform against babylon to make the land of babylon a
desol without an inhabit

51:30 the mighti men of babylon have forborn to fight they have
remain in their holds: their might hath failed; they becam as
women: they have burn her dwellingplaces; her bar are broken

51:31 one post shall run to meet anoth and one messeng to meet
anoth to shew the king of babylon that hi citi is taken at one
end 51:32 and that the passag are stop and the reed they have
burn with fire and the men of war are affright

51:33 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel; the
daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh
her: yet a littl while and the time of her harvest shall come

51:34 nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devour me he hath
crush me he hath made me an empti vessel he hath swallow me up
like a dragon he hath fill hi belli with my delic he hath
cast me out

51:35 the violenc done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall
the inhabit of zion say; and my blood upon the inhabit of
chaldea shall jerusalem say

51:36 therefor thu saith the lord; behold i will plead thi caus
and take vengeanc for thee; and i will dri up her sea and make her
spring dri

51:37 and babylon shall becom heap a dwellingplac for dragon an
astonish and an hiss without an inhabit

51:38 they shall roar togeth like lions: they shall yell as lion
whelp

51:39 in their heat i will make their feast and i will make them
drunken that they may rejoic and sleep a perpetu sleep and not
wake saith the lord

51:40 i will bring them down like lamb to the slaughter like ram
with he goat

51:41 how is sheshach taken! and how is the prais of the whole earth
surprised! how is babylon becom an astonish among the nations!
51:42 the sea is come up upon babylon: she is cover with the
multitud of the wave thereof

51:43 her citi are a desol a dri land and a wilder a
land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth ani son of man pass
therebi

51:44 and i will punish bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of
hi mouth that which he hath swallow up: and the nation shall not
flow togeth ani more unto him: yea the wall of babylon shall fall

51:45 my peopl go ye out of the midst of her and deliv ye everi
man hi soul from the fierc anger of the lord

51:46 and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall
be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year and after
that in anoth year shall come a rumour and violenc in the land
ruler against ruler

51:47 therefor behold the day come that i will do judgment upon
the graven imag of babylon: and her whole land shall be confound
and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her

51:48 then the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall
sing for babylon: for the spoiler shall come unto her from the north
saith the lord

51:49 as babylon hath caus the slain of israel to fall so at
babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth

51:50 ye that have escap the sword go away stand not still:
rememb the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind

51:51 we are confound becaus we have heard reproach: shame hath
cover our faces: for stranger are come into the sanctuari of the
lord hous

51:52 wherefor behold the day come saith the lord that i will do
judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wound
shall groan

51:53 though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should
fortifi the height of her strength yet from me shall spoiler come
unto her saith the lord

51:54 a sound of a cri cometh from babylon and great destruct from
the land of the chaldeans: 51:55 becaus the lord hath spoil
babylon and destroy out of her the great voice; when her wave do
roar like great water a nois of their voic is uttered: 51:56
becaus the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her
mighti men are taken everi one of their bow is broken: for the lord
god of recomp shall sure requit

51:57 and i will make drunk her princ and her wise men her
captain and her ruler and her mighti men: and they shall sleep a
perpetu sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord
of host

51:58 thu saith the lord of hosts; the broad wall of babylon shall
be utterli broken and her high gate shall be burn with fire; and
the peopl shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they
shall be weari

51:59 the word which jeremiah the prophet command seraiah the son of
neriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of
judah into babylon in the fourth year of hi reign and thi seraiah
wa a quiet princ

51:60 so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
babylon even all these word that are written against babylon

51:61 and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon and
shalt see and shalt read all these words; 51:62 then shalt thou say
o lord thou hast spoken against thi place to cut it off that none
shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be
desol for ever

51:63 and it shall be when thou hast made an end of read thi
book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst
of euphrates: 51:64 and thou shalt say thu shall babylon sink and
shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her: and they
shall be weari thu far are the word of jeremiah

52:1 zedekiah wa one and twenti year old when he began to reign and
he reign eleven year in jerusalem and hi mother name wa
hamut the daughter of jeremiah of libnah

52:2 and he did that which wa evil in the eye of the lord accord
to all that jehoiakim had done

52:3 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem
and judah till he had cast them out from hi presenc that zedekiah

52:4 and it came to pass in the ninth year of hi reign in the tenth
month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of
babylon came he and all hi armi against jerusalem and pitch
against it and built fort against it round about

52:5 so the citi wa besieg unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah

52:6 and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the
famin wa sore in the citi so that there wa no bread for the peopl
of the land

52:7 then the citi wa broken up and all the men of war fled and
went forth out of the citi by night by the way of the gate between the
two wall which wa by the king garden; (now the chaldean were by
the citi round about:) and they went by the way of the plain

52:8 but the armi of the chaldean pursu after the king and
overtook zedekiah in the plain of jericho; and all hi armi wa
scatter from him

52:9 then they took the king and carri him up unto the king of
babylon to riblah in the land of hamath; where he gave judgment upon
him

52:10 and the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah befor hi
eyes: he slew also all the princ of judah in riblah

52:11 then he put out the eye of zedekiah; and the king of babylon
bound him in chain and carri him to babylon and put him in prison
till the day of hi death

52:12 now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which wa
the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came
nebuzaradan captain of the guard which serv the king of babylon
into jerusalem 52:13 and burn the hous of the lord and the king

of babylon and the rest of the multitud

52:16 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedress and for husbandmen

52:17 also the pillar of brass that were in the hous of the lord
and the base and the brasen sea that wa in the hous of the lord

52:19 and the bason and the firepan and the bowl and the
caldron and the candlestick and the spoon and the cups; that

the brass of all these vessel wa without weight

52:21 and concern the pillar the height of one pillar wa
eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelv cubit did compass it; and the
thick thereof wa four fingers: it wa hollow

52:22 and a chapit of brass wa upon it; and the height of one
chapit wa five cubit with network and pomegran upon the
chapit round about all of brass the second pillar also and the
pomegran were like unto these

52:23 and there were nineti and six pomegran on a side; and all
the pomegran upon the network were an hundr round about

52:24 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and
zephaniah the second priest and the three keeper of the door: 52:25
he took also out of the citi an eunuch which had the charg of the
men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king person
which were found in the city; and the princip scribe of the host
who muster the peopl of the land; and threescor men of the peopl
of the land that were found in the midst of the citi

52:26 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought
them to the king of babylon to riblah

52:27 and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death in
riblah in the land of hamath thu judah wa carri away captiv out
of hi own land

52:28 thi is the peopl whom nebuchadrezzar carri away captive: in

52:31 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the

in the first year of hi reign lift up the head of jehoiachin king

day of hi life

52:34 and for hi diet there wa a continu diet given him of the

the lament of jeremiah


1:1 how doth the citi sit solitari that wa full of people! how is
she becom as a widow! she that wa great among the nation and
princess among the provinc how is she becom tributary! 1:2 she
weepeth sore in the night and her tear are on her cheeks: among all
her lover she hath none to comfort her: all her friend have dealt
treacher with her they are becom her enemi

1:3 judah is gone into captiv becaus of afflict and becaus of
great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest:
all her persecutor overtook her between the strait

1:4 the way of zion do mourn becaus none come to the solemn feasts:
all her gate are desolate: her priest sigh her virgin are
afflict and she is in bitter

1:5 her adversari are the chief her enemi prosper; for the lord
hath afflict her for the multitud of her transgressions: her
children are gone into captiv befor the enemi

1:6 and from the daughter of zion all her beauti is departed: her
princ are becom like hart that find no pastur and they are gone
without strength befor the pursuer

1:7 jerusalem rememb in the day of her afflict and of her
miseri all her pleasant thing that she had in the day of old when
her peopl fell into the hand of the enemi and none did help her: the
adversari saw her and did mock at her sabbath

1:8 jerusalem hath grievous sinned; therefor she is removed: all
that honour her despis her becaus they have seen her nakedness:
yea she sigheth and turneth backward

1:9 her filthi is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;
therefor she came down wonderfully: she had no comfort o lord
behold my affliction: for the enemi hath magnifi himself

1:10 the adversari hath spread out hi hand upon all her pleasant
things: for she hath seen that the heathen enter into her sanctuari
whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thi
congreg

1:11 all her peopl sigh they seek bread; they have given their
pleasant thing for meat to reliev the soul: see o lord and
consider; for i am becom vile

1:12 is it noth to you all ye that pass by? behold and see if
there be ani sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me
wherewith the lord hath afflict me in the day of hi fierc anger

1:13 from abov hath he sent fire into my bone and it prevaileth
against them: he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turn me
back: he hath made me desol and faint all the day

1:14 the yoke of my transgress is bound by hi hand: they are
wreath and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall
the lord hath deliv me into their hand from whom i am not abl
to rise up

1:15 the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighti men in the midst
of me: he hath call an assembl against me to crush my young men:
the lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of judah as in a
winepress

1:16 for these thing i weep; mine eye mine eye runneth down with
water becaus the comfort that should reliev my soul is far from
me: my children are desol becaus the enemi prevail

1:17 zion spreadeth forth her hand and there is none to comfort her:
the lord hath command concern jacob that hi adversari should
be round about him: jerusalem is as a menstruou woman among them

1:18 the lord is righteous; for i have rebel against hi
commandment: hear i pray you all peopl and behold my sorrow: my
virgin and my young men are gone into captiv

1:19 i call for my lover but they deceiv me: my priest and mine
elder gave up the ghost in the citi while they sought their meat to
reliev their soul

1:20 behold o lord; for i am in distress: my bowel are troubled;
mine heart is turn within me; for i have grievous rebelled: abroad
the sword bereaveth at home there is as death

1:21 they have heard that i sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
mine enemi have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast
done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast call and they shall
be like unto me

1:22 let all their wicked come befor thee; and do unto them as
thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sigh are
mani and my heart is faint

2:1 how hath the lord cover the daughter of zion with a cloud in hi
anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauti of israel
and rememb not hi footstool in the day of hi anger! 2:2 the
lord hath swallow up all the habit of jacob and hath not
pitied: he hath thrown down in hi wrath the strong hold of the
daughter of judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath
pollut the kingdom and the princ thereof

2:3 he hath cut off in hi fierc anger all the horn of israel: he
hath drawn back hi right hand from befor the enemi and he burn
against jacob like a flame fire which devoureth round about

2:4 he hath bent hi bow like an enemy: he stood with hi right hand
as an adversari and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacl of the daughter of zion: he pour out hi furi like fire

2:5 the lord wa as an enemy: he hath swallow up israel he hath
swallow up all her palaces: he hath destroy hi strong hold and
hath increas in the daughter of judah mourn and lament

2:6 and he hath violent taken away hi tabernacl as if it were of
a garden: he hath destroy hi place of the assembly: the lord hath
caus the solemn feast and sabbath to be forgotten in zion and
hath despis in the indign of hi anger the king and the priest

2:7 the lord hath cast off hi altar he hath abhor hi sanctuari
he hath given up into the hand of the enemi the wall of her palaces;
they have made a nois in the hous of the lord as in the day of a
solemn feast

2:8 the lord hath purpos to destroy the wall of the daughter of
zion: he hath stretch out a line he hath not withdrawn hi hand
from destroying: therefor he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
they languish togeth

2:9 her gate are sunk into the ground; he hath destroy and broken
her bars: her king and her princ are among the gentiles: the law is
no more; her prophet also find no vision from the lord

2:10 the elder of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground and keep
silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have gird
themselv with sackcloth: the virgin of jerusalem hang down their
head to the ground

2:11 mine eye do fail with tear my bowel are troubl my liver is
pour upon the earth for the destruct of the daughter of my
people; becaus the children and the suckl swoon in the street of
the citi

2:12 they say to their mother where is corn and wine? when they
swoon as the wound in the street of the citi when their soul wa
pour out into their mother bosom

2:13 what thing shall i take to wit for thee? what thing shall i
liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem? what shall i equal to thee
that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion? for thi breach is
great like the sea: who can heal thee? 2:14 thi prophet have seen
vain and foolish thing for thee: and they have not discov thine
iniqu to turn away thi captivity; but have seen for thee fals
burden and caus of banish

2:15 all that pass by clap their hand at thee; they hiss and wag
their head at the daughter of jerusalem say is thi the citi that
men call the perfect of beauti the joy of the whole earth? 2:16
all thine enemi have open their mouth against thee: they hiss and
gnash the teeth: they say we have swallow her up: certainli thi is
the day that we look for; we have found we have seen it

2:17 the lord hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfil
hi word that he had command in the day of old: he hath thrown
down and hath not pitied: and he hath caus thine enemi to rejoic
over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversari

2:18 their heart cri unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion
let tear run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest;
let not the appl of thine eye ceas

2:19 aris cri out in the night: in the begin of the watch pour
out thine heart like water befor the face of the lord: lift up thi
hand toward him for the life of thi young children that faint for
hunger in the top of everi street

2:20 behold o lord and consid to whom thou hast done thi shall
the women eat their fruit and children of a span long? shall the
priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuari of the lord? 2:21
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgin and
my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day
of thine anger; thou hast kill and not piti

2:22 thou hast call as in a solemn day my terror round about so
that in the day of the lord anger none escap nor remained: those
that i have swaddl and brought up hath mine enemi consum

3:1 i am the man that hath seen afflict by the rod of hi wrath

3:2 he hath led me and brought me into dark but not into light

3:3 sure against me is he turned; he turneth hi hand against me all
the day

3:4 my flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bone

3:5 he hath build against me and compass me with gall and
travail

3:6 he hath set me in dark place as they that be dead of old

3:7 he hath hedg me about that i cannot get out: he hath made my
chain heavi

3:8 also when i cri and shout he shutteth out my prayer

3:9 he hath inclos my way with hewn stone he hath made my path
crook

3:10 he wa unto me as a bear lie in wait and as a lion in secret
place

3:11 he hath turn asid my way and pull me in pieces: he hath
made me desol

3:12 he hath bent hi bow and set me as a mark for the arrow

3:13 he hath caus the arrow of hi quiver to enter into my rein

3:14 i wa a deris to all my people; and their song all the day

3:15 he hath fill me with bitter he hath made me drunken with
wormwood

3:16 he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stone he hath cover
me with ash

3:17 and thou hast remov my soul far off from peace: i forgat
prosper

3:18 and i said my strength and my hope is perish from the lord:
3:19 rememb mine afflict and my miseri the wormwood and the
gall

3:20 my soul hath them still in remembr and is humbl in me

3:21 thi i recal to my mind therefor have i hope

3:22 it is of the lord merci that we are not consum becaus hi
compass fail not

3:23 they are new everi morning: great is thi faith

3:24 the lord is my portion saith my soul; therefor will i hope in
him

3:25 the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that
seeketh him

3:26 it is good that a man should both hope and quietli wait for the
salvat of the lord

3:27 it is good for a man that he bear the yoke of hi youth

3:28 he sitteth alon and keepeth silenc becaus he hath born it
upon him

3:29 he putteth hi mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope

3:30 he giveth hi cheek to him that smiteth him: he is fill full
with reproach

3:31 for the lord will not cast off for ever: 3:32 but though he caus
grief yet will he have compass accord to the multitud of hi
merci

3:33 for he doth not afflict willingli nor griev the children of men

3:34 to crush under hi feet all the prison of the earth

3:35 to turn asid the right of a man befor the face of the most
high 3:36 to subvert a man in hi caus the lord approveth not

3:37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord
commandeth it not? 3:38 out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth
not evil and good? 3:39 wherefor doth a live man complain a man
for the punish of hi sins? 3:40 let us search and tri our way
and turn again to the lord

3:41 let us lift up our heart with our hand unto god in the heaven

3:42 we have transgress and have rebelled: thou hast not pardon

3:43 thou hast cover with anger and persecut us: thou hast slain
thou hast not piti

3:44 thou hast cover thyself with a cloud that our prayer should
not pass through

3:45 thou hast made us as the offscour and refus in the midst of
the peopl

3:46 all our enemi have open their mouth against us

3:47 fear and a snare is come upon us desol and destruct

3:48 mine eye runneth down with river of water for the destruct of
the daughter of my peopl

3:49 mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without ani
intermiss

3:50 till the lord look down and behold from heaven

3:51 mine eye affecteth mine heart becaus of all the daughter of my
citi

3:52 mine enemi chase me sore like a bird without caus

3:53 they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon
me

3:54 water flow over mine head; then i said i am cut off

3:55 i call upon thi name o lord out of the low dungeon

3:56 thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breath at
my cri

3:57 thou drewest near in the day that i call upon thee: thou
saidst fear not

3:58 o lord thou hast plead the caus of my soul; thou hast
redeem my life

3:59 o lord thou hast seen my wrong: judg thou my caus

3:60 thou hast seen all their vengeanc and all their imagin

3:61 thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their
imagin against me; 3:62 the lip of those that rose up against

4:4 the tongu of the suck child cleaveth to the roof of hi mouth
for thirst: the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto
them

4:5 they that did feed delic are desol in the streets: they
that were brought up in scarlet embrac dunghil

4:6 for the punish of the iniqu of the daughter of my peopl is
greater than the punish of the sin of sodom that wa overthrown

4:7 her nazarit were purer than snow they were whiter than milk
they were more ruddi in bodi than rubi their polish wa of

4:9 they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
slain with hunger: for these pine away stricken through for want of

4:10 the hand of the piti women have sodden their own children:
they were their meat in the destruct of the daughter of my peopl

4:11 the lord hath accomplish hi fury; he hath pour out hi

4:12 the king of the earth and all the inhabit of the world
would not have believ that the adversari and the enemi should have

the elder

4:17 as for us our eye as yet fail for our vain help: in our
watch we have watch for a nation that could not save us

4:19 our persecutor are swifter than the eagl of the heaven: they

the book of the prophet ezekiel


1:1 now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month
in the fifth day of the month as i wa among the captiv by the river
of chebar that the heaven were open and i saw vision of god

1:2 in the fifth day of the month which wa the fifth year of king
jehoiachin captiv 1:3 the word of the lord came expressli unto
ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldean by
the river chebar; and the hand of the lord wa there upon him

1:4 and i look and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a
great cloud and a fire infold itself and a bright wa about
it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the
midst of the fire

1:5 also out of the midst thereof came the like of four live
creatur and thi wa their appearance; they had the like of a
man

1:6 and everi one had four face and everi one had four wing

1:7 and their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet wa
like the sole of a calf foot: and they sparkl like the colour of
burnish brass

1:8 and they had the hand of a man under their wing on their four
sides; and they four had their face and their wing

1:9 their wing were join one to another; they turn not when they
went; they went everi one straight forward

1:10 as for the like of their face they four had the face of a
man and the face of a lion on the right side: and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an
eagl

1:11 thu were their faces: and their wing were stretch upward; two
wing of everi one were join one to anoth and two cover their
bodi

1:12 and they went everi one straight forward: whither the spirit wa
to go they went; and they turn not when they went

1:13 as for the like of the live creatur their appear wa
like burn coal of fire and like the appear of lamps: it went
up and down among the live creatures; and the fire wa bright and
out of the fire went forth lightn

1:14 and the live creatur ran and return as the appear of a
flash of lightn

1:15 now as i beheld the live creatur behold one wheel upon the
earth by the live creatur with hi four face

1:16 the appear of the wheel and their work wa like unto the
colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
appear and their work wa as it were a wheel in the middl of a
wheel

1:17 when they went they went upon their four sides: and they turn
not when they went

1:18 as for their ring they were so high that they were dreadful;
and their ring were full of eye round about them four

1:19 and when the live creatur went the wheel went by them: and
when the live creatur were lift up from the earth the wheel
were lift up

1:20 whithersoev the spirit wa to go they went thither wa their
spirit to go; and the wheel were lift up over against them: for the
spirit of the live creatur wa in the wheel

1:21 when those went these went; and when those stood these stood;
and when those were lift up from the earth the wheel were lift
up over against them: for the spirit of the live creatur wa in the
wheel

1:22 and the like of the firmament upon the head of the live
creatur wa as the colour of the terribl crystal stretch forth
over their head abov

1:23 and under the firmament were their wing straight the one toward
the other: everi one had two which cover on thi side and everi
one had two which cover on that side their bodi

1:24 and when they went i heard the nois of their wing like the
nois of great water as the voic of the almighti the voic of
speech as the nois of an host: when they stood they let down their
wing

1:25 and there wa a voic from the firmament that wa over their
head when they stood and had let down their wing

1:26 and abov the firmament that wa over their head wa the
like of a throne as the appear of a sapphir stone: and upon
the like of the throne wa the like as the appear of a man
abov upon it

1:27 and i saw as the colour of amber as the appear of fire round
about within it from the appear of hi loin even upward and
from the appear of hi loin even downward i saw as it were the
appear of fire and it had bright round about

1:28 as the appear of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
rain so wa the appear of the bright round about thi wa
the appear of the like of the glori of the lord and when i
saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voic of one that spake

2:1 and he said unto me son of man stand upon thi feet and i will
speak unto thee

2:2 and the spirit enter into me when he spake unto me and set me
upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me

2:3 and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of
israel to a rebelli nation that hath rebel against me: they and
their father have transgress against me even unto thi veri day

2:4 for they are impud children and stiffheart i do send thee
unto them; and thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord god

2:5 and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear
(for they are a rebelli house) yet shall know that there hath been
a prophet among them

2:6 and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of
their word though brier and thorn be with thee and thou dost
dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their word nor be dismay
at their look though they be a rebelli hous

2:7 and thou shalt speak my word unto them whether they will hear
or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebelli

2:8 but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee; be not thou
rebelli like that rebelli house: open thi mouth and eat that i
give thee

2:9 and when i look behold an hand wa sent unto me; and lo a
roll of a book wa therein; 2:10 and he spread it befor me; and it
wa written within and without: and there wa written therein
lament and mourn and woe

3:1 moreov he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest; eat
thi roll and go speak unto the hous of israel

3:2 so i open my mouth and he caus me to eat that roll

3:3 and he said unto me son of man caus thi belli to eat and fill
thi bowel with thi roll that i give thee then did i eat it; and it
wa in my mouth as honey for sweet

3:4 and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the hous of
israel and speak with my word unto them

3:5 for thou art not sent to a peopl of a strang speech and of an
hard languag but to the hous of israel; 3:6 not to mani peopl of a
strang speech and of an hard languag whose word thou canst not
understand sure had i sent thee to them they would have hearken
unto thee

3:7 but the hous of israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will
not hearken unto me: for all the hous of israel are impud and
hardheart

3:8 behold i have made thi face strong against their face and thi
forehead strong against their forehead

3:9 as an adam harder than flint have i made thi forehead: fear
them not neither be dismay at their look though they be a
rebelli hous

3:10 moreov he said unto me son of man all my word that i shall
speak unto thee receiv in thine heart and hear with thine ear

3:11 and go get thee to them of the captiv unto the children of
thi peopl and speak unto them and tell them thu saith the lord
god; whether they will hear or whether they will forbear

3:12 then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voic of a
great rush say bless be the glori of the lord from hi
place

3:13 i heard also the nois of the wing of the live creatur that
touch one anoth and the nois of the wheel over against them
and a nois of a great rush

3:14 so the spirit lift me up and took me away and i went in
bitter in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the lord wa
strong upon me

3:15 then i came to them of the captiv at telabib that dwelt by
the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remain there
astonish among them seven day

3:16 and it came to pass at the end of seven day that the word of
the lord came unto me say 3:17 son of man i have made thee a
watchman unto the hous of israel: therefor hear the word at my
mouth and give them warn from me

3:18 when i say unto the wick thou shalt sure die; and thou
givest him not warn nor speakest to warn the wick from hi
wick way to save hi life; the same wick man shall die in hi
iniquity; but hi blood will i requir at thine hand

3:19 yet if thou warn the wick and he turn not from hi wicked
nor from hi wick way he shall die in hi iniquity; but thou hast
deliv thi soul

3:20 again when a righteou man doth turn from hi righteous and
commit iniqu and i lay a stumbling-block befor him he shall die:
becaus thou hast not given him warn he shall die in hi sin and
hi righteous which he hath done shall not be remembered; but hi
blood will i requir at thine hand

3:21 nevertheless if thou warn the righteou man that the righteou
sin not and he doth not sin he shall sure live becaus he is
warned; also thou hast deliv thi soul

3:22 and the hand of the lord wa there upon me; and he said unto me
aris go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee

3:23 then i aros and went forth into the plain: and behold the
glori of the lord stood there as the glori which i saw by the river
of chebar: and i fell on my face

3:24 then the spirit enter into me and set me upon my feet and
spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine hous

3:25 but thou o son of man behold they shall put band upon thee
and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them:
3:26 and i will make thi tongu cleav to the roof of thi mouth that
thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are
a rebelli hous

3:27 but when i speak with thee i will open thi mouth and thou shalt
say unto them thu saith the lord god; he that heareth let him hear;
and he that forbeareth let him forbear: for they are a rebelli
hous

4:1 thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it befor thee
and pourtray upon it the citi even jerusalem: 4:2 and lay sieg
against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it;
set the camp also against it and set batter ram against it round
about

4:3 moreov take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of
iron between thee and the city: and set thi face against it and it
shall be besieg and thou shalt lay sieg against it thi shall be
a sign to the hous of israel

4:4 lie thou also upon thi left side and lay the iniqu of the
hous of israel upon it: accord to the number of the day that thou
shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniqu

4:5 for i have laid upon thee the year of their iniqu accord
to the number of the day three hundr and nineti days: so shalt
thou bear the iniqu of the hous of israel

4:6 and when thou hast accomplish them lie again on thi right side
and thou shalt bear the iniqu of the hous of judah forti days: i
have appoint thee each day for a year

4:7 therefor thou shalt set thi face toward the sieg of jerusalem
and thine arm shall be uncov and thou shalt prophesi against it

4:8 and behold i will lay band upon thee and thou shalt not turn
thee from one side to anoth till thou hast end the day of thi
sieg

4:9 take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and bean and
lentil and millet and fitch and put them in one vessel and
make thee bread thereof accord to the number of the day that thou
shalt lie upon thi side three hundr and nineti day shalt thou eat
thereof

4:10 and thi meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenti
shekel a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it

4:11 thou shalt drink also water by measur the sixth part of an hin:
from time to time shalt thou drink

4:12 and thou shalt eat it as barley cake and thou shalt bake it
with dung that cometh out of man in their sight

4:13 and the lord said even thu shall the children of israel eat
their defil bread among the gentil whither i will drive them

4:14 then said i ah lord god! behold my soul hath not been polluted:
for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which
dieth of itself or is torn in pieces; neither came there abomin
flesh into my mouth

4:15 then he said unto me lo i have given thee cow dung for man
dung and thou shalt prepar thi bread therewith

4:16 moreov he said unto me son of man behold i will break the
staff of bread in jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight and
with care; and they shall drink water by measur and with
astonishment: 4:17 that they may want bread and water and be astoni
one with anoth and consum away for their iniqu

5:1 and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a
barber razor and caus it to pass upon thine head and upon thi
beard: then take thee balanc to weigh and divid the hair

5:2 thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the citi
when the day of the sieg are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third
part and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt
scatter in the wind; and i will draw out a sword after them

5:3 thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thi
skirt

5:4 then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire
and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into
all the hous of israel

5:5 thu saith the lord god; thi is jerusalem: i have set it in the
midst of the nation and countri that are round about her

5:6 and she hath chang my judgment into wicked more than the
nation and my statut more than the countri that are round about
her: for they have refus my judgment and my statut they have not
walk in them

5:7 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus ye multipli more than
the nation that are round about you and have not walk in my
statut neither have kept my judgment neither have done accord
to the judgment of the nation that are round about you; 5:8
therefor thu saith the lord god; behold i even i am against thee
and will execut judgment in the midst of thee in the sight of the
nation

5:9 and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i
will not do ani more the like becaus of all thine abomin

5:10 therefor the father shall eat the son in the midst of thee
and the son shall eat their fathers; and i will execut judgment in
thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the wind

5:11 wherefor as i live saith the lord god; sure becaus thou
hast defil my sanctuari with all thi detest thing and with all
thine abomin therefor will i also diminish thee; neither shall
mine eye spare neither will i have ani piti

5:12 a third part of thee shall die with the pestil and with
famin shall they be consum in the midst of thee: and a third part
shall fall by the sword round about thee; and i will scatter a third
part into all the wind and i will draw out a sword after them

5:13 thu shall mine anger be accomplish and i will caus my furi
to rest upon them and i will be comforted: and they shall know that i
the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplish my furi
in them

5:14 moreov i will make thee wast and a reproach among the nation
that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by

5:15 so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruct and an
astonish unto the nation that are round about thee when i shall
execut judgment in thee in anger and in furi and in furiou rebuk
i the lord have spoken it

5:16 when i shall send upon them the evil arrow of famin which
shall be for their destruct and which i will send to destroy you:
and i will increas the famin upon you and will break your staff of
bread: 5:17 so will i send upon you famin and evil beast and they
shall bereav thee: and pestil and blood shall pass through thee;
and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it

6:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 6:2 son of man set
thi face toward the mountain of israel and prophesi against them
6:3 and say ye mountain of israel hear the word of the lord god;
thu saith the lord god to the mountain and to the hill to the
river and to the valleys; behold i even i will bring a sword upon
you and i will destroy your high place

6:4 and your altar shall be desol and your imag shall be
broken: and i will cast down your slain men befor your idol

6:5 and i will lay the dead carcas of the children of israel befor
their idols; and i will scatter your bone round about your altar

6:6 in all your dwellingplac the citi shall be laid wast and the
high place shall be desolate; that your altar may be laid wast and
made desol and your idol may be broken and ceas and your imag
may be cut down and your work may be abolish

6:7 and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know
that i am the lord

6:8 yet will i leav a remnant that ye may have some that shall
escap the sword among the nation when ye shall be scatter through
the countri

6:9 and they that escap of you shall rememb me among the nation
whither they shall be carri captiv becaus i am broken with their
whorish heart which hath depart from me and with their eye which
go a whore after their idols: and they shall loth themselv for
the evil which they have commit in all their abomin

6:10 and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said
in vain that i would do thi evil unto them

6:11 thu saith the lord god; smite with thine hand and stamp with
thi foot and say ala for all the evil abomin of the hous of
israel! for they shall fall by the sword by the famin and by the
pestil

6:12 he that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieg
shall die by the famine: thu will i accomplish my furi upon them

6:13 then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall
be among their idol round about their altar upon everi high hill
in all the top of the mountain and under everi green tree and
under everi thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to
all their idol

6:14 so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land
desol yea more desol than the wilder toward diblath in
all their habitations: and they shall know that i am the lord

7:1 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say 7:2 also thou
son of man thu saith the lord god unto the land of israel; an end
the end is come upon the four corner of the land

7:3 now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon
thee and will judg thee accord to thi way and will recompens
upon thee all thine abomin

7:4 and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity: but i
will recompens thi way upon thee and thine abomin shall be in
the midst of thee: and ye shall know that i am the lord

7:5 thu saith the lord god; an evil an onli evil behold is come

7:6 an end is come the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold it
is come

7:7 the morn is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land:
the time is come the day of troubl is near and not the sound
again of the mountain

7:8 now will i shortli pour out my furi upon thee and accomplish mine
anger upon thee: and i will judg thee accord to thi way and will
recompens thee for all thine abomin

7:9 and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity: i will
recompens thee accord to thi way and thine abomin that are
in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that i am the lord that
smiteth

7:10 behold the day behold it is come: the morn is gone forth;
the rod hath blossom pride hath bud

7:11 violenc is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
remain nor of their multitud nor of ani of theirs: neither shall
there be wail for them

7:12 the time is come the day draweth near: let not the buyer
rejoic nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitud
thereof

7:13 for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although
they were yet alive: for the vision is touch the whole multitud
thereof which shall not return; neither shall ani strengthen himself
in the iniqu of hi life

7:14 they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready; but none
goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitud thereof

7:15 the sword is without and the pestil and the famin within:
he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in
the citi famin and pestil shall devour him

7:16 but they that escap of them shall escap and shall be on the
mountain like dove of the valley all of them mourn everi one
for hi iniqu

7:17 all hand shall be feebl and all knee shall be weak as water

7:18 they shall also gird themselv with sackcloth and horror shall
cover them; and shame shall be upon all face and bald upon all
their head

7:19 they shall cast their silver in the street and their gold shall
be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be abl to deliv
them in the day of the wrath of the lord: they shall not satisfi their
soul neither fill their bowels: becaus it is the stumblingblock of
their iniqu

7:20 as for the beauti of hi ornament he set it in majesty: but they
made the imag of their abomin and of their detest thing
therein: therefor have i set it far from them

7:21 and i will give it into the hand of the stranger for a prey
and to the wick of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollut it

7:22 my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollut my
secret place: for the robber shall enter into it and defil it

7:23 make a chain: for the land is full of bloodi crime and the citi
is full of violenc

7:24 wherefor i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall
possess their houses: i will also make the pomp of the strong to
cease; and their holi place shall be defil

7:25 destruct cometh; and they shall seek peac and there shall be
none

7:26 mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon
rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law
shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancient

7:27 the king shall mourn and the princ shall be cloth with
desol and the hand of the peopl of the land shall be troubled:
i will do unto them after their way and accord to their desert
will i judg them; and they shall know that i am the lord

8:1 and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the
fifth day of the month as i sat in mine hous and the elder of
judah sat befor me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me

8:2 then i beheld and lo a like as the appear of fire: from
the appear of hi loin even downward fire; and from hi loin
even upward as the appear of bright as the colour of amber

8:3 and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of
mine head; and the spirit lift me up between the earth and the
heaven and brought me in the vision of god to jerusalem to the door
of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where wa the seat of
the imag of jealousi which provoketh to jealousi

8:4 and behold the glori of the god of israel wa there accord
to the vision that i saw in the plain

8:5 then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eye now the way
toward the north so i lift up mine eye the way toward the north
and behold northward at the gate of the altar thi imag of jealousi
in the entri

8:6 he said furthermor unto me son of man seest thou what they do?
even the great abomin that the hous of israel committeth here
that i should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again
and thou shalt see greater abomin

8:7 and he brought me to the door of the court; and when i look
behold a hole in the wall

8:8 then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall: and when i
had dig in the wall behold a door

8:9 and he said unto me go in and behold the wick abomin
that they do here

8:10 so i went in and saw; and behold everi form of creep thing
and abomin beast and all the idol of the hous of israel
pourtray upon the wall round about

8:11 and there stood befor them seventi men of the ancient of the
hous of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of
shaphan with everi man hi censer in hi hand; and a thick cloud of
incens went up

8:12 then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the
ancient of the hous of israel do in the dark everi man in the
chamber of hi imagery? for they say the lord seeth us not; the lord
hath forsaken the earth

8:13 he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see
greater abomin that they do

8:14 then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord hous
which wa toward the north; and behold there sat women weep for
tammuz

8:15 then said he unto me hast thou seen thi o son of man? turn
thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abomin than these

8:16 and he brought me into the inner court of the lord hous and
behold at the door of the templ of the lord between the porch and
the altar were about five and twenti men with their back toward the
templ of the lord and their face toward the east; and they
worship the sun toward the east

8:17 then he said unto me hast thou seen thi o son of man? is it a
light thing to the hous of judah that they commit the abomin
which they commit here? for they have fill the land with violenc
and have return to provok me to anger: and lo they put the branch
to their nose

8:18 therefor will i also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare
neither will i have pity: and though they cri in mine ear with a loud
voic yet will i not hear them

9:1 he cri also in mine ear with a loud voic say caus them
that have charg over the citi to draw near even everi man with hi
destroy weapon in hi hand

9:2 and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which
lieth toward the north and everi man a slaughter weapon in hi hand;
and one man among them wa cloth with linen with a writer inkhorn
by hi side: and they went in and stood besid the brasen altar

9:3 and the glori of the god of israel wa gone up from the cherub
whereupon he wa to the threshold of the hous and he call to the
man cloth with linen which had the writer inkhorn by hi side;
9:4 and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the citi
through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the forehead of
the men that sigh and that cri for all the abomin that be done
in the midst thereof

9:5 and to the other he said in mine hear go ye after him through
the citi and smite: let not your eye spare neither have ye pity: 9:6
slay utterli old and young both maid and littl children and
women: but come not near ani man upon whom is the mark; and begin at
my sanctuari then they began at the ancient men which were befor the
hous

9:7 and he said unto them defil the hous and fill the court with
the slain: go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the citi

9:8 and it came to pass while they were slay them and i wa left
that i fell upon my face and cri and said ah lord god! wilt thou
destroy all the residu of israel in thi pour out of thi furi upon
jerusalem? 9:9 then said he unto me the iniqu of the hous of
israel and judah is exceed great and the land is full of blood
and the citi full of perverseness: for they say the lord hath
forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not

9:10 and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have
piti but i will recompens their way upon their head

9:11 and behold the man cloth with linen which had the inkhorn by
hi side report the matter say i have done as thou hast
command me

10:1 then i look and behold in the firmament that wa abov the
head of the cherubim there appear over them as it were a sapphir
stone as the appear of the like of a throne

10:2 and he spake unto the man cloth with linen and said go in
between the wheel even under the cherub and fill thine hand with
coal of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the
citi and he went in in my sight

10:3 now the cherubim stood on the right side of the hous when the
man went in; and the cloud fill the inner court

10:4 then the glori of the lord went up from the cherub and stood
over the threshold of the house; and the hous wa fill with the
cloud and the court wa full of the bright of the lord glori

10:5 and the sound of the cherubim wing wa heard even to the outer
court as the voic of the almighti god when he speaketh

10:6 and it came to pass that when he had command the man cloth
with linen say take fire from between the wheel from between
the cherubims; then he went in and stood besid the wheel

10:7 and one cherub stretch forth hi hand from between the
cherubim unto the fire that wa between the cherubim and took
thereof and put it into the hand of him that wa cloth with linen:
who took it and went out

10:8 and there appear in the cherubim the form of a man hand
under their wing

10:9 and when i look behold the four wheel by the cherubim one
wheel by one cherub and anoth wheel by anoth cherub: and the
appear of the wheel wa as the colour of a beryl stone

10:10 and as for their appear they four had one like as if
a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel

10:11 when they went they went upon their four sides; they turn not
as they went but to the place whither the head look they follow
it; they turn not as they went

10:12 and their whole bodi and their back and their hand and
their wing and the wheel were full of eye round about even the
wheel that they four had

10:13 as for the wheel it wa cri unto them in my hear o
wheel

10:14 and everi one had four faces: the first face wa the face of a
cherub and the second face wa the face of a man and the third the
face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagl

10:15 and the cherubim were lift up thi is the live creatur
that i saw by the river of chebar

10:16 and when the cherubim went the wheel went by them: and when
the cherubim lift up their wing to mount up from the earth the
same wheel also turn not from besid them

10:17 when they stood these stood; and when they were lift up
these lift up themselv also: for the spirit of the live creatur
wa in them

10:18 then the glori of the lord depart from off the threshold of
the hous and stood over the cherubim

10:19 and the cherubim lift up their wing and mount up from the
earth in my sight: when they went out the wheel also were besid
them and everi one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord
house; and the glori of the god of israel wa over them abov

10:20 thi is the live creatur that i saw under the god of israel
by the river of chebar; and i knew that they were the cherubim

10:21 everi one had four face apiec and everi one four wings; and
the like of the hand of a man wa under their wing

10:22 and the like of their face wa the same face which i saw
by the river of chebar their appear and themselves: they went
everi one straight forward

11:1 moreov the spirit lift me up and brought me unto the east
gate of the lord hous which looketh eastward: and behold at the
door of the gate five and twenti men; among whom i saw jaazaniah the
son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princ of the peopl

11:2 then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devis
mischief and give wick counsel in thi city: 11:3 which say it is
not near; let us build houses: thi citi is the caldron and we be the
flesh

11:4 therefor prophesi against them prophesi o son of man

11:5 and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak;
thu saith the lord; thu have ye said o hous of israel: for i know
the thing that come into your mind everi one of them

11:6 ye have multipli your slain in thi citi and ye have fill
the street thereof with the slain

11:7 therefor thu saith the lord god; your slain whom ye have laid
in the midst of it they are the flesh and thi citi is the caldron:
but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it

11:8 ye have fear the sword; and i will bring a sword upon you
saith the lord god

11:9 and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliv you
into the hand of stranger and will execut judgment among you

11:10 ye shall fall by the sword; i will judg you in the border of
israel; and ye shall know that i am the lord

11:11 thi citi shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the
flesh in the midst thereof; but i will judg you in the border of
israel: 11:12 and ye shall know that i am the lord: for ye have not
walk in my statut neither execut my judgment but have done
after the manner of the heathen that are round about you

11:13 and it came to pass when i prophesi that pelatiah the son of
benaiah die then fell i down upon my face and cri with a loud
voic and said ah lord god! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant
of israel? 11:14 again the word of the lord came unto me say
11:15 son of man thi brethren even thi brethren the men of thi
kindr and all the hous of israel wholli are they unto whom the
inhabit of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord: unto us
is thi land given in possess

11:16 therefor say thu saith the lord god; although i have cast
them far off among the heathen and although i have scatter them
among the countri yet will i be to them as a littl sanctuari in
the countri where they shall come

11:17 therefor say thu saith the lord god; i will even gather you
from the peopl and assembl you out of the countri where ye have
been scatter and i will give you the land of israel

11:18 and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the
detest thing thereof and all the abomin thereof from
thenc

11:19 and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit
within you; and i will take the stoni heart out of their flesh and
will give them an heart of flesh: 11:20 that they may walk in my
statut and keep mine ordin and do them: and they shall be my
peopl and i will be their god

11:21 but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
detest thing and their abomin i will recompens their way
upon their own head saith the lord god

11:22 then did the cherubim lift up their wing and the wheel
besid them; and the glori of the god of israel wa over them abov

11:23 and the glori of the lord went up from the midst of the citi
and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the citi

11:24 afterward the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by
the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captiv so the
vision that i had seen went up from me

11:25 then i spake unto them of the captiv all the thing that the
lord had shew me

12:1 the word of the lord also came unto me say 12:2 son of man
thou dwellest in the midst of a rebelli hous which have eye to
see and see not; they have ear to hear and hear not: for they are a
rebelli hous

12:3 therefor thou son of man prepar thee stuff for remov and
remov by day in their sight; and thou shalt remov from thi place to
anoth place in their sight: it may be they will consid though
they be a rebelli hous

12:4 then shalt thou bring forth thi stuff by day in their sight as
stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as
they that go forth into captiv

12:5 dig thou through the wall in their sight and carri out therebi

12:6 in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thi shoulder and carri
it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thi face that thou see not
the ground: for i have set thee for a sign unto the hous of israel

12:7 and i did so as i wa commanded: i brought forth my stuff by day
as stuff for captiv and in the even i dig through the wall with
mine hand; i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my
shoulder in their sight

12:8 and in the morn came the word of the lord unto me say
12:9 son of man hath not the hous of israel the rebelli hous
said unto thee what doest thou? 12:10 say thou unto them thu saith
the lord god; thi burden concerneth the princ in jerusalem and all
the hous of israel that are among them

12:11 say i am your sign: like as i have done so shall it be done
unto them: they shall remov and go into captiv

12:12 and the princ that is among them shall bear upon hi shoulder
in the twilight and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall
to carri out thereby: he shall cover hi face that he see not the
ground with hi eye

12:13 my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my
snare: and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans;
yet shall he not see it though he shall die there

12:14 and i will scatter toward everi wind all that are about him to
help him and all hi bands; and i will draw out the sword after them

12:15 and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter
them among the nation and dispers them in the countri

12:16 but i will leav a few men of them from the sword from the
famin and from the pestilence; that they may declar all their
abomin among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know
that i am the lord

12:17 moreov the word of the lord came to me say 12:18 son of
man eat thi bread with quak and drink thi water with trembl
and with carefulness; 12:19 and say unto the peopl of the land thu
saith the lord god of the inhabit of jerusalem and of the land of
israel; they shall eat their bread with care and drink their
water with astonish that her land may be desol from all that
is therein becaus of the violenc of all them that dwell therein

12:20 and the citi that are inhabit shall be laid wast and the
land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that i am the lord

12:21 and the word of the lord came unto me say 12:22 son of man
what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel say the
day are prolong and everi vision faileth? 12:23 tell them
therefor thu saith the lord god; i will make thi proverb to ceas
and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel; but say unto
them the day are at hand and the effect of everi vision

12:24 for there shall be no more ani vain vision nor flatter
divin within the hous of israel

12:25 for i am the lord: i will speak and the word that i shall speak
shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your day o
rebelli hous will i say the word and will perform it saith the
lord god

12:26 again the word of the lord came to me say

12:27 son of man behold they of the hous of israel say the vision
that he seeth is for mani day to come and he prophesieth of the
time that are far off

12:28 therefor say unto them thu saith the lord god; there shall
none of my word be prolong ani more but the word which i have
spoken shall be done saith the lord god

13:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 13:2 son of man
prophesi against the prophet of israel that prophesi and say thou
unto them that prophesi out of their own heart hear ye the word of
the lord; 13:3 thu saith the lord god; woe unto the foolish prophet
that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! 13:4 o israel
thi prophet are like the fox in the desert

13:5 ye have not gone up into the gap neither made up the hedg for
the hous of israel to stand in the battl in the day of the lord

13:6 they have seen vaniti and lie divin say the lord
saith: and the lord hath not sent them: and they have made other to
hope that they would confirm the word

13:7 have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lie
divin wherea ye say the lord saith it; albeit i have not
spoken? 13:8 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus ye have
spoken vaniti and seen lie therefor behold i am against you
saith the lord god

13:9 and mine hand shall be upon the prophet that see vaniti and
that divin lies: they shall not be in the assembl of my peopl
neither shall they be written in the write of the hous of israel
neither shall they enter into the land of israel; and ye shall know
that i am the lord god

13:10 becaus even becaus they have seduc my peopl say
peace; and there wa no peace; and one built up a wall and lo
other daub it with untemp morter: 13:11 say unto them which
daub it with untemp morter that it shall fall: there shall be an
overflow shower; and ye o great hailston shall fall; and a
stormi wind shall rend it

13:12 lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you
where is the daub wherewith ye have daub it? 13:13 therefor
thu saith the lord god; i will even rend it with a stormi wind in my
fury; and there shall be an overflow shower in mine anger and
great hailston in my furi to consum it

13:14 so will i break down the wall that ye have daub with
untemp morter and bring it down to the ground so that the
foundat thereof shall be discov and it shall fall and ye
shall be consum in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that i am
the lord

13:15 thu will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them
that have daub it with untemp morter and will say unto you the
wall is no more neither they that daub it; 13:16 to wit the
prophet of israel which prophesi concern jerusalem and which see
vision of peac for her and there is no peac saith the lord god

13:17 likewis thou son of man set thi face against the daughter of
thi peopl which prophesi out of their own heart; and prophesi thou
against them 13:18 and say thu saith the lord god; woe to the women
that sew pillow to all armhol and make kerchief upon the head of
everi statur to hunt souls! will ye hunt the soul of my peopl and
will ye save the soul aliv that come unto you? 13:19 and will ye
pollut me among my peopl for hand of barley and for piec of
bread to slay the soul that should not die and to save the soul
aliv that should not live by your lie to my peopl that hear your
lies? 13:20 wherefor thu saith the lord god; behold i am against
your pillow wherewith ye there hunt the soul to make them fli and
i will tear them from your arm and will let the soul go even the
soul that ye hunt to make them fli

13:21 your kerchief also will i tear and deliv my peopl out of
your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye
shall know that i am the lord

13:22 becaus with lie ye have made the heart of the righteou sad
whom i have not made sad; and strengthen the hand of the wick
that he should not return from hi wick way by promis him life:
13:23 therefor ye shall see no more vaniti nor divin divinations:
for i will deliv my peopl out of your hand: and ye shall know that
i am the lord

14:1 then came certain of the elder of israel unto me and sat befor
me

14:2 and the word of the lord came unto me say 14:3 son of man
these men have set up their idol in their heart and put the
stumblingblock of their iniqu befor their face: should i be
enquir of at all by them? 14:4 therefor speak unto them and say
unto them thu saith the lord god; everi man of the hous of israel
that setteth up hi idol in hi heart and putteth the stumblingblock
of hi iniqu befor hi face and cometh to the prophet; i the lord
will answer him that cometh accord to the multitud of hi idols;
14:5 that i may take the hous of israel in their own heart becaus
they are all estrang from me through their idol

14:6 therefor say unto the hous of israel thu saith the lord god;
repent and turn yourselv from your idols; and turn away your face
from all your abomin

14:7 for everi one of the hous of israel or of the stranger that
sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up
hi idol in hi heart and putteth the stumblingblock of hi iniqu
befor hi face and cometh to a prophet to enquir of him concern
me; i the lord will answer him by myself: 14:8 and i will set my face
against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will
cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that i am
the lord

14:9 and if the prophet be deceiv when he hath spoken a thing i the
lord have deceiv that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon
him and will destroy him from the midst of my peopl israel

14:10 and they shall bear the punish of their iniquity: the
punish of the prophet shall be even as the punish of him that
seeketh unto him; 14:11 that the hous of israel may go no more astray
from me neither be pollut ani more with all their transgressions;
but that they may be my peopl and i may be their god saith the lord
god

14:12 the word of the lord came again to me say 14:13 son of man
when the land sinneth against me by trespass grievous then will
i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread
thereof and will send famin upon it and will cut off man and beast
from it: 14:14 though these three men noah daniel and job were in
it they should deliv but their own soul by their righteous
saith the lord god

14:15 if i caus noisom beast to pass through the land and they
spoil it so that it be desol that no man may pass through becaus
of the beasts: 14:16 though these three men were in it as i live
saith the lord god they shall deliv neither son nor daughters;
they onli shall be deliv but the land shall be desol

14:17 or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through
the land; so that i cut off man and beast from it: 14:18 though these
three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall
deliv neither son nor daughter but they onli shall be deliv
themselv

14:19 or if i send a pestil into that land and pour out my furi
upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast: 14:20 though noah
daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall
deliv neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliv their own
soul by their righteous

14:21 for thu saith the lord god; how much more when i send my four
sore judgment upon jerusalem the sword and the famin and the
noisom beast and the pestil to cut off from it man and beast?
14:22 yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
brought forth both son and daughters: behold they shall come forth
unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be
comfort concern the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even
concern all that i have brought upon it

14:23 and they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their
doings: and ye shall know that i have not done without caus all that
i have done in it saith the lord god

15:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 15:2 son of man
what is the vine tree more than ani tree or than a branch which is
among the tree of the forest? 15:3 shall wood be taken thereof to do
ani work? or will men take a pin of it to hang ani vessel thereon?
15:4 behold it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
both the end of it and the midst of it is burn is it meet for ani
work? 15:5 behold when it wa whole it wa meet for no work: how
much less shall it be meet yet for ani work when the fire hath
devour it and it is burned? 15:6 therefor thu saith the lord
god; as the vine tree among the tree of the forest which i have
given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabit of
jerusalem

15:7 and i will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
fire and anoth fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that i am
the lord when i set my face against them

15:8 and i will make the land desol becaus they have commit a
trespass saith the lord god

16:1 again the word of the lord came unto me say 16:2 son of man
caus jerusalem to know her abomin 16:3 and say thu saith the
lord god unto jerusalem; thi birth and thi nativ is of the land of
canaan; thi father wa an amorit and thi mother an hittit

16:4 and as for thi nativ in the day thou wast born thi navel wa
not cut neither wast thou wash in water to suppl thee; thou wast
not salt at all nor swaddl at all

16:5 none eye piti thee to do ani of these unto thee to have
compass upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field to the
loth of thi person in the day that thou wast born

16:6 and when i pass by thee and saw thee pollut in thine own
blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thi blood live; yea i said
unto thee when thou wast in thi blood live

16:7 i have caus thee to multipli as the bud of the field and thou
hast increas and waxen great and thou art come to excel
ornaments: thi breast are fashion and thine hair is grown wherea
thou wast nake and bare

16:8 now when i pass by thee and look upon thee behold thi time
wa the time of love; and i spread my skirt over thee and cover thi
nakedness: yea i sware unto thee and enter into a coven with
thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine

16:9 then wash i thee with water; yea i throughli wash away thi
blood from thee and i anoint thee with oil

16:10 i cloth thee also with broider work and shod thee with
badger skin and i gird thee about with fine linen and i cover
thee with silk

16:11 i deck thee also with ornament and i put bracelet upon thi
hand and a chain on thi neck

16:12 and i put a jewel on thi forehead and ear in thine ear
and a beauti crown upon thine head

16:13 thu wast thou deck with gold and silver; and thi raiment wa
of fine linen and silk and broider work; thou didst eat fine
flour and honey and oil: and thou wast exceed beauti and thou
didst prosper into a kingdom

16:14 and thi renown went forth among the heathen for thi beauty: for
it wa perfect through my comeli which i had put upon thee saith
the lord god

16:15 but thou didst trust in thine own beauti and playedst the
harlot becaus of thi renown and pouredst out thi fornic on
everi one that pass by; hi it wa

16:16 and of thi garment thou didst take and deckedst thi high
place with diver colour and playedst the harlot thereupon: the
like thing shall not come neither shall it be so

16:17 thou hast also taken thi fair jewel of my gold and of my
silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself imag of men
and didst commit whoredom with them 16:18 and tookest thi broider
garment and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine
incens befor them

16:19 my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey
wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it befor them for a sweet
savour: and thu it wa saith the lord god

16:20 moreov thou hast taken thi son and thi daughter whom thou
hast born unto me and these hast thou sacrif unto them to be
devour is thi of thi whoredom a small matter 16:21 that thou
hast slain my children and deliv them to caus them to pass
through the fire for them? 16:22 and in all thine abomin and
thi whoredom thou hast not rememb the day of thi youth when
thou wast nake and bare and wast pollut in thi blood

16:23 and it came to pass after all thi wicked (woe woe unto
thee! saith the lord god;) 16:24 that thou hast also built unto thee
an emin place and hast made thee an high place in everi street

16:25 thou hast built thi high place at everi head of the way and
hast made thi beauti to be abhor and hast open thi feet to everi
one that pass by and multipli thi whoredom

16:26 thou hast also commit fornic with the egyptian thi
neighbour great of flesh; and hast increas thi whoredom to
provok me to anger

16:27 behold therefor i have stretch out my hand over thee and
have diminish thine ordinari food and deliv thee unto the will
of them that hate thee the daughter of the philistin which are
asham of thi lewd way

16:28 thou hast play the whore also with the assyrian becaus thou
wast unsatiable; yea thou hast play the harlot with them and yet
couldest not be satisfi

16:29 thou hast moreov multipli thi fornic in the land of
canaan unto chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfi therewith

16:30 how weak is thine heart saith the lord god see thou doest
all these thing the work of an imperi whorish woman; 16:31 in
that thou buildest thine emin place in the head of everi way and
makest thine high place in everi street; and hast not been as an
harlot in that thou scornest hire; 16:32 but as a wife that
committeth adulteri which taketh stranger instead of her husband!
16:33 they give gift to all whores: but thou givest thi gift to all
thi lover and hirest them that they may come unto thee on everi
side for thi whoredom

16:34 and the contrari is in thee from other women in thi whoredom
wherea none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou
givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefor thou art
contrari

16:35 wherefor o harlot hear the word of the lord: 16:36 thu saith
the lord god; becaus thi filthi wa pour out and thi naked
discov through thi whoredom with thi lover and with all the
idol of thi abomin and by the blood of thi children which
thou didst give unto them; 16:37 behold therefor i will gather all
thi lover with whom thou hast taken pleasur and all them that thou
hast love with all them that thou hast hated; i will even gather
them round about against thee and will discov thi naked unto
them that they may see all thi naked

16:38 and i will judg thee as women that break wedlock and shed
blood are judged; and i will give thee blood in furi and jealousi

16:39 and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw
down thine emin place and shall break down thi high places: they
shall strip thee also of thi cloth and shall take thi fair jewel
and leav thee nake and bare

16:40 they shall also bring up a compani against thee and they shall
stone thee with stone and thrust thee through with their sword

16:41 and they shall burn thine hous with fire and execut
judgment upon thee in the sight of mani women: and i will caus thee
to ceas from play the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire ani
more

16:42 so will i make my furi toward thee to rest and my jealousi
shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more
angri

16:43 becaus thou hast not rememb the day of thi youth but hast
fret me in all these things; behold therefor i also will
recompens thi way upon thine head saith the lord god: and thou shalt
not commit thi lewd abov all thine abomin

16:44 behold everi one that useth proverb shall use thi proverb
against thee say as is the mother so is her daughter

16:45 thou art thi mother daughter that lotheth her husband and her
children; and thou art the sister of thi sister which loth their
husband and their children: your mother wa an hittit and your
father an amorit

16:46 and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughter that
dwell at thi left hand: and thi younger sister that dwelleth at thi
right hand is sodom and her daughter

16:47 yet hast thou not walk after their way nor done after their
abominations: but as if that were a veri littl thing thou wast
corrupt more than they in all thi way

16:48 as i live saith the lord god sodom thi sister hath not done
she nor her daughter as thou hast done thou and thi daughter

16:49 behold thi wa the iniqu of thi sister sodom pride
ful of bread and abund of idl wa in her and in her
daughter neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needi

16:50 and they were haughti and commit abomin befor me:
therefor i took them away as i saw good

16:51 neither hath samaria commit half of thi sins; but thou hast
multipli thine abomin more than they and hast justifi thi
sister in all thine abomin which thou hast done

16:52 thou also which hast judg thi sister bear thine own shame
for thi sin that thou hast commit more abomin than they: they
are more righteou than thou: yea be thou confound also and bear
thi shame in that thou hast justifi thi sister

16:53 when i shall bring again their captiv the captiv of sodom
and her daughter and the captiv of samaria and her daughter
then will i bring again the captiv of thi captiv in the midst of
them: 16:54 that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be
confound in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto
them

16:55 when thi sister sodom and her daughter shall return to their
former estat and samaria and her daughter shall return to their
former estat then thou and thi daughter shall return to your former
estat

16:56 for thi sister sodom wa not mention by thi mouth in the day
of thi pride 16:57 befor thi wicked wa discov as at the
time of thi reproach of the daughter of syria and all that are round
about her the daughter of the philistin which despis thee round
about

16:58 thou hast born thi lewd and thine abomin saith the
lord

16:59 for thu saith the lord god; i will even deal with thee as thou
hast done which hast despis the oath in break the coven

16:60 nevertheless i will rememb my coven with thee in the day
of thi youth and i will establish unto thee an everlast coven

16:61 then thou shalt rememb thi way and be asham when thou
shalt receiv thi sister thine elder and thi younger: and i will
give them unto thee for daughter but not by thi coven

16:62 and i will establish my coven with thee; and thou shalt know
that i am the lord: 16:63 that thou mayest rememb and be
confound and never open thi mouth ani more becaus of thi shame
when i am pacifi toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the
lord god

17:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 17:2 son of man
put forth a riddl and speak a parabl unto the hous of israel; 17:3
and say thu saith the lord god; a great eagl with great wing
longwing full of feather which had diver colour came unto
lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar: 17:4 he crop off
the top of hi young twig and carri it into a land of traffick; he
set it in a citi of merchant

17:5 he took also of the seed of the land and plant it in a
fruit field; he place it by great water and set it as a willow
tree

17:6 and it grew and becam a spread vine of low statur whose
branch turn toward him and the root thereof were under him: so
it becam a vine and brought forth branch and shot forth sprig

17:7 there wa also anoth great eagl with great wing and mani
feathers: and behold thi vine did bend her root toward him and
shot forth her branch toward him that he might water it by the
furrow of her plantat

17:8 it wa plant in a good soil by great water that it might
bring forth branch and that it might bear fruit that it might be a
goodli vine

17:9 say thou thu saith the lord god; shall it prosper? shall he not
pull up the root thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it
wither? it shall wither in all the leav of her spring even without
great power or mani peopl to pluck it up by the root thereof

17:10 yea behold be plant shall it prosper? shall it not
utterli wither when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the
furrow where it grew

17:11 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say 17:12 say
now to the rebelli hous know ye not what these thing mean? tell
them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken
the king thereof and the princ thereof and led them with him to
babylon; 17:13 and hath taken of the king seed and made a coven
with him and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighti
of the land: 17:14 that the kingdom might be base that it might not
lift itself up but that by keep of hi coven it might stand

17:15 but he rebel against him in send hi ambassador into
egypt that they might give him hors and much peopl shall he
prosper? shall he escap that doeth such things? or shall he break the
coven and be delivered? 17:16 as i live saith the lord god
sure in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose
oath he despis and whose coven he brake even with him in the
midst of babylon he shall die

17:17 neither shall pharaoh with hi mighti armi and great compani
make for him in the war by cast up mount and build fort to
cut off mani persons: 17:18 see he despis the oath by break
the coven when lo he had given hi hand and hath done all these
thing he shall not escap

17:19 therefor thu saith the lord god; as i live sure mine oath
that he hath despis and my coven that he hath broken even it
will i recompens upon hi own head

17:20 and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my
snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there
for hi trespass that he hath trespass against me

17:21 and all hi fugit with all hi band shall fall by the
sword and they that remain shall be scatter toward all winds: and
ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it

17:22 thu saith the lord god; i will also take of the highest branch
of the high cedar and will set it; i will crop off from the top of
hi young twig a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain
and eminent: 17:23 in the mountain of the height of israel will i
plant it: and it shall bring forth bough and bear fruit and be a
goodli cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of everi wing; in the
shadow of the branch thereof shall they dwell

17:24 and all the tree of the field shall know that i the lord have
brought down the high tree have exalt the low tree have dri up
the green tree and have made the dri tree to flourish: i the lord
have spoken and have done it

18:1 the word of the lord came unto me again say 18:2 what mean
ye that ye use thi proverb concern the land of israel say
the father have eaten sour grape and the children teeth are set
on edge? 18:3 as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have
occas ani more to use thi proverb in israel

18:4 behold all soul are mine; as the soul of the father so also
the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth it shall die

18:5 but if a man be just and do that which is law and right 18:6
and hath not eaten upon the mountain neither hath lift up hi eye
to the idol of the hous of israel neither hath defil hi
neighbour wife neither hath come near to a menstruou woman 18:7
and hath not oppress ani but hath restor to the debtor hi
pledg hath spoil none by violenc hath given hi bread to the
hungri and hath cover the nake with a garment; 18:8 he that hath
not given forth upon usuri neither hath taken ani increas that hath
withdrawn hi hand from iniqu hath execut true judgment between
man and man 18:9 hath walk in my statut and hath kept my
judgment to deal truly; he is just he shall sure live saith the
lord god

18:10 if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that
doeth the like to ani one of these thing 18:11 and that doeth not
ani of those duti but even hath eaten upon the mountain and
defil hi neighbour wife 18:12 hath oppress the poor and needi
hath spoil by violenc hath not restor the pledg and hath
lift up hi eye to the idol hath commit abomin 18:13
hath given forth upon usuri and hath taken increase: shall he then
live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall
sure die; hi blood shall be upon him

18:14 now lo if he beget a son that seeth all hi father sin
which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like 18:15
that hath not eaten upon the mountain neither hath lift up hi
eye to the idol of the hous of israel hath not defil hi
neighbour wife 18:16 neither hath oppress ani hath not
withholden the pledg neither hath spoil by violenc but hath
given hi bread to the hungri and hath cover the nake with a
garment 18:17 that hath taken off hi hand from the poor that hath
not receiv usuri nor increas hath execut my judgment hath
walk in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniqu of hi
father he shall sure live

18:18 as for hi father becaus he cruelli oppress spoil hi
brother by violenc and did that which is not good among hi peopl
lo even he shall die in hi iniqu

18:19 yet say ye why? doth not the son bear the iniqu of the
father? when the son hath done that which is law and right and
hath kept all my statut and hath done them he shall sure live

18:20 the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the
iniqu of the father neither shall the father bear the iniqu of
the son: the righteous of the righteou shall be upon him and the
wicked of the wick shall be upon him

18:21 but if the wick will turn from all hi sin that he hath
commit and keep all my statut and do that which is law and
right he shall sure live he shall not die

18:22 all hi transgress that he hath commit they shall not be
mention unto him: in hi righteous that he hath done he shall
live

18:23 have i ani pleasur at all that the wick should die? saith the
lord god: and not that he should return from hi way and live?
18:24 but when the righteou turneth away from hi righteous and
committeth iniqu and doeth accord to all the abomin that
the wick man doeth shall he live? all hi righteous that he
hath done shall not be mentioned: in hi trespass that he hath
trespass and in hi sin that he hath sin in them shall he die

18:25 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o hous
of israel; is not my way equal? are not your way unequal? 18:26 when
a righteou man turneth away from hi righteous and committeth
iniqu and dieth in them; for hi iniqu that he hath done shall
he die

18:27 again when the wick man turneth away from hi wicked that
he hath commit and doeth that which is law and right he shall
save hi soul aliv

18:28 becaus he considereth and turneth away from all hi
transgress that he hath commit he shall sure live he shall
not die

18:29 yet saith the hous of israel the way of the lord is not equal
o hous of israel are not my way equal? are not your way unequal?
18:30 therefor i will judg you o hous of israel everi one
accord to hi way saith the lord god repent and turn yourselv
from all your transgressions; so iniqu shall not be your ruin

18:31 cast away from you all your transgress wherebi ye have
transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for whi will
ye die o hous of israel? 18:32 for i have no pleasur in the death
of him that dieth saith the lord god: wherefor turn yourselv and
live ye

19:1 moreov take thou up a lament for the princ of israel
19:2 and say what is thi mother? a lioness: she lay down among lion
she nourish her whelp among young lion

19:3 and she brought up one of her whelps: it becam a young lion and
it learn to catch the prey; it devour men

19:4 the nation also heard of him; he wa taken in their pit and
they brought him with chain unto the land of egypt

19:5 now when she saw that she had wait and her hope wa lost then
she took anoth of her whelp and made him a young lion

19:6 and he went up and down among the lion he becam a young lion
and learn to catch the prey and devour men

19:7 and he knew their desol palac and he laid wast their
cities; and the land wa desol and the ful thereof by the
nois of hi roar

19:8 then the nation set against him on everi side from the
provinc and spread their net over him: he wa taken in their pit

19:9 and they put him in ward in chain and brought him to the king
of babylon: they brought him into hold that hi voic should no more
be heard upon the mountain of israel

19:10 thi mother is like a vine in thi blood plant by the waters:
she wa fruit and full of branch by reason of mani water

19:11 and she had strong rod for the sceptr of them that bare rule
and her statur wa exalt among the thick branch and she appear
in her height with the multitud of her branch

19:12 but she wa pluck up in furi she wa cast down to the ground
and the east wind dri up her fruit: her strong rod were broken and
withered; the fire consum them

19:13 and now she is plant in the wilder in a dri and thirsti
ground

19:14 and fire is gone out of a rod of her branch which hath
devour her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptr to
rule thi is a lament and shall be for a lament

20:1 and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the
tenth day of the month that certain of the elder of israel came to
enquir of the lord and sat befor me

20:2 then came the word of the lord unto me say 20:3 son of man
speak unto the elder of israel and say unto them thu saith the
lord god; are ye come to enquir of me? as i live saith the lord god
i will not be enquir of by you

20:4 wilt thou judg them son of man wilt thou judg them? caus
them to know the abomin of their fathers: 20:5 and say unto
them thu saith the lord god; in the day when i chose israel and
lift up mine hand unto the seed of the hous of jacob and made
myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lift up mine
hand unto them say i am the lord your god; 20:6 in the day that i
lift up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of
egypt into a land that i had espi for them flow with milk and
honey which is the glori of all lands: 20:7 then said i unto them
cast ye away everi man the abomin of hi eye and defil not
yourselv with the idol of egypt: i am the lord your god

20:8 but they rebel against me and would not hearken unto me: they
did not everi man cast away the abomin of their eye neither
did they forsak the idol of egypt: then i said i will pour out my
furi upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of
the land of egypt

20:9 but i wrought for my name sake that it should not be pollut
befor the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself
known unto them in bring them forth out of the land of egypt

20:10 wherefor i caus them to go forth out of the land of egypt
and brought them into the wilder

20:11 and i gave them my statut and shew them my judgment which
if a man do he shall even live in them

20:12 moreov also i gave them my sabbath to be a sign between me
and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctifi them

20:13 but the hous of israel rebel against me in the wilderness:
they walk not in my statut and they despis my judgment which
if a man do he shall even live in them; and my sabbath they greatli
polluted: then i said i would pour out my furi upon them in the
wilder to consum them

20:14 but i wrought for my name sake that it should not be pollut
befor the heathen in whose sight i brought them out

20:15 yet also i lift up my hand unto them in the wilder that i
would not bring them into the land which i had given them flow
with milk and honey which is the glori of all lands; 20:16 becaus
they despis my judgment and walk not in my statut but
pollut my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idol

20:17 nevertheless mine eye spare them from destroy them neither
did i make an end of them in the wilder

20:18 but i said unto their children in the wilder walk ye not in
the statut of your father neither observ their judgment nor
defil yourselv with their idols: 20:19 i am the lord your god; walk
in my statut and keep my judgment and do them; 20:20 and hallow
my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may
know that i am the lord your god

20:21 notwithstand the children rebel against me: they walk
not in my statut neither kept my judgment to do them which if a
man do he shall even live in them; they pollut my sabbaths: then i
said i would pour out my furi upon them to accomplish my anger
against them in the wilder

20:22 nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my name
sake that it should not be pollut in the sight of the heathen in
whose sight i brought them forth

20:23 i lift up mine hand unto them also in the wilder that i
would scatter them among the heathen and dispers them through the
countries; 20:24 becaus they had not execut my judgment but had
despis my statut and had pollut my sabbath and their eye
were after their father idol

20:25 wherefor i gave them also statut that were not good and
judgment wherebi they should not live; 20:26 and i pollut them in
their own gift in that they caus to pass through the fire all that
openeth the womb that i might make them desol to the end that
they might know that i am the lord

20:27 therefor son of man speak unto the hous of israel and say
unto them thu saith the lord god; yet in thi your father have
blasphem me in that they have commit a trespass against me

20:28 for when i had brought them into the land for the which i
lift up mine hand to give it to them then they saw everi high hill
and all the thick tree and they offer there their sacrific and
there they present the provoc of their offering: there also
they made their sweet savour and pour out there their drink
offer

20:29 then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go?
and the name whereof is call bamah unto thi day

20:30 wherefor say unto the hous of israel thu saith the lord god;
are ye pollut after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye
whoredom after their abominations? 20:31 for when ye offer your
gift when ye make your son to pass through the fire ye pollut
yourselv with all your idol even unto thi day: and shall i be
enquir of by you o hous of israel? as i live saith the lord god
i will not be enquir of by you

20:32 and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that
ye say we will be as the heathen as the famili of the countri
to serv wood and stone

20:33 as i live saith the lord god sure with a mighti hand and
with a stretch out arm and with furi pour out will i rule over
you: 20:34 and i will bring you out from the peopl and will gather
you out of the countri wherein ye are scatter with a mighti hand
and with a stretch out arm and with furi pour out

20:35 and i will bring you into the wilder of the peopl and
there will i plead with you face to face

20:36 like as i plead with your father in the wilder of the
land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god

20:37 and i will caus you to pass under the rod and i will bring you
into the bond of the covenant: 20:38 and i will purg out from among
you the rebel and them that transgress against me: i will bring them
forth out of the countri where they sojourn and they shall not enter
into the land of israel: and ye shall know that i am the lord

20:39 as for you o hous of israel thu saith the lord god; go ye
serv ye everi one hi idol and hereaft also if ye will not
hearken unto me: but pollut ye my holi name no more with your gift
and with your idol

20:40 for in mine holi mountain in the mountain of the height of
israel saith the lord god there shall all the hous of israel all
of them in the land serv me: there will i accept them and there
will i requir your offer and the firstfruit of your oblat
with all your holi thing

20:41 i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out
from the peopl and gather you out of the countri wherein ye have
been scattered; and i will be sanctifi in you befor the heathen

20:42 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you
into the land of israel into the countri for the which i lift up
mine hand to give it to your father

20:43 and there shall ye rememb your way and all your do
wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall loth yourselv in your
own sight for all your evil that ye have commit

20:44 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with
you for my name sake not accord to your wick way nor
accord to your corrupt do o ye hous of israel saith the lord
god

20:45 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say 20:46 son of
man set thi face toward the south and drop thi word toward the
south and prophesi against the forest of the south field; 20:47 and
say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord; thu saith
the lord god; behold i will kindl a fire in thee and it shall
devour everi green tree in thee and everi dri tree: the flame flame
shall not be quench and all face from the south to the north shall
be burn therein

20:48 and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindl it: it
shall not be quench

20:49 then said i ah lord god! they say of me doth he not speak
parables? 21:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 21:2
son of man set thi face toward jerusalem and drop thi word toward
the holi place and prophesi against the land of israel 21:3 and say
to the land of israel thu saith the lord; behold i am against thee
and will draw forth my sword out of hi sheath and will cut off from
thee the righteou and the wick

21:4 see then that i will cut off from thee the righteou and the
wick therefor shall my sword go forth out of hi sheath against
all flesh from the south to the north: 21:5 that all flesh may know
that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of hi sheath: it shall
not return ani more

21:6 sigh therefor thou son of man with the break of thi loins;
and with bitter sigh befor their eye

21:7 and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefor sighest thou?
that thou shalt answer for the tidings; becaus it cometh: and everi
heart shall melt and all hand shall be feebl and everi spirit
shall faint and all knee shall be weak as water: behold it cometh
and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god

21:8 again the word of the lord came unto me say 21:9 son of man
prophesi and say thu saith the lord; say a sword a sword is
sharpen and also furbished: 21:10 it is sharpen to make a sore
slaughter; it is furbish that it may glitter: should we then make
mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son as everi tree

21:11 and he hath given it to be furbish that it may be handled:
thi sword is sharpen and it is furbish to give it into the hand
of the slayer

21:12 cri and howl son of man: for it shall be upon my peopl it
shall be upon all the princ of israel: terror by reason of the
sword shall be upon my people: smite therefor upon thi thigh

21:13 becaus it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the
rod? it shall be no more saith the lord god

21:14 thou therefor son of man prophesi and smite thine hand
togeth and let the sword be doubl the third time the sword of
the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain which
entereth into their privi chamber

21:15 i have set the point of the sword against all their gate that
their heart may faint and their ruin be multiplied: ah! it is made
bright it is wrap up for the slaughter

21:16 go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the
left whithersoev thi face is set

21:17 i will also smite mine hand togeth and i will caus my furi
to rest: i the lord have said it

21:18 the word of the lord came unto me again say 21:19 also
thou son of man appoint thee two way that the sword of the king of
babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and
choos thou a place choos it at the head of the way to the citi

21:20 appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the
ammonit and to judah in jerusalem the defenc

21:21 for the king of babylon stood at the part of the way at the
head of the two way to use divination: he made hi arrow bright he
consult with imag he look in the liver

21:22 at hi right hand wa the divin for jerusalem to appoint
captain to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voic
with shout to appoint batter ram against the gate to cast a
mount and to build a fort

21:23 and it shall be unto them as a fals divin in their sight
to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembr the
iniqu that they may be taken

21:24 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus ye have made your
iniqu to be rememb in that your transgress are discov
so that in all your do your sin do appear; becaus i say that
ye are come to remembr ye shall be taken with the hand

21:25 and thou profan wick princ of israel whose day is come
when iniqu shall have an end 21:26 thu saith the lord god; remov
the diadem and take off the crown: thi shall not be the same: exalt
him that is low and abas him that is high

21:27 i will overturn overturn overturn it: and it shall be no
more until he come whose right it is; and i will give it him

21:28 and thou son of man prophesi and say thu saith the lord god
concern the ammonit and concern their reproach; even say
thou the sword the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is
furbish to consum becaus of the glittering: 21:29 while they see
vaniti unto thee while they divin a lie unto thee to bring thee
upon the neck of them that are slain of the wick whose day is
come when their iniqu shall have an end

21:30 shall i caus it to return into hi sheath? i will judg thee in
the place where thou wast creat in the land of thi nativ

21:31 and i will pour out mine indign upon thee i will blow
against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliv thee into the hand
of brutish men and skil to destroy

21:32 thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thi blood shall be in the
midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for i the lord
have spoken it

22:1 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say 22:2 now
thou son of man wilt thou judg wilt thou judg the bloodi city?
yea thou shalt shew her all her abomin

22:3 then say thou thu saith the lord god the citi sheddeth blood
in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idol against
herself to defil herself

22:4 thou art becom guilti in thi blood that thou hast shed; and hast
defil thyself in thine idol which thou hast made; and thou hast
caus thi day to draw near and art come even unto thi years:
therefor have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mock
to all countri

22:5 those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock
thee which art infam and much vex

22:6 behold the princ of israel everi one were in thee to their
power to shed blood

22:7 in thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of
thee have they dealt by oppress with the stranger: in thee have
they vex the fatherless and the widow

22:8 thou hast despis mine holi thing and hast profan my
sabbath

22:9 in thee are men that carri tale to shed blood: and in thee they
eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewd

22:10 in thee have they discov their father nakedness: in thee
have they humbl her that wa set apart for pollut

22:11 and one hath commit abomin with hi neighbour wife;
and anoth hath lewdli defil hi daughter in law; and anoth in

22:12 in thee have they taken gift to shed blood; thou hast taken
usuri and increas and thou hast greedili gain of thi neighbour by
extort and hast forgotten me saith the lord god

22:13 behold therefor i have smitten mine hand at thi dishonest gain
which thou hast made and at thi blood which hath been in the midst of
thee

22:14 can thine heart endur or can thine hand be strong in the
day that i shall deal with thee? i the lord have spoken it and will
do it

22:15 and i will scatter thee among the heathen and dispers thee in
the countri and will consum thi filthi out of thee

22:16 and thou shalt take thine inherit in thyself in the sight of
the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord

22:17 and the word of the lord came unto me say 22:18 son of man
the hous of israel is to me becom dross: all they are brass and
tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they are even
the dross of silver

22:19 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus ye are all becom
dross behold therefor i will gather you into the midst of
jerusalem

22:20 as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
into the midst of the furnac to blow the fire upon it to melt it;
so will i gather you in mine anger and in my furi and i will leav
you there and melt you

22:21 yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my
wrath and ye shall be melt in the midst therof

22:22 as silver is melt in the midst of the furnac so shall ye be
melt in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that i the lord have
pour out my furi upon you

22:23 and the word of the lord came unto me say 22:24 son of man
say unto her thou art the land that is not cleans nor rain upon
in the day of indign

22:25 there is a conspiraci of her prophet in the midst thereof like
a roar lion raven the prey; they have devour souls; they have
taken the treasur and preciou things; they have made her mani widow
in the midst thereof

22:26 her priest have violat my law and have profan mine holi
things: they have put no differ between the holi and profan
neither have they shew differ between the unclean and the clean
and have hid their eye from my sabbath and i am profan among
them

22:27 her princ in the midst thereof are like wolv raven the
prey to shed blood and to destroy soul to get dishonest gain

22:28 and her prophet have daub them with untemp morter see
vaniti and divin lie unto them say thu saith the lord god
when the lord hath not spoken

22:29 the peopl of the land have use oppress and exercis
robberi and have vex the poor and needy: yea they have oppress
the stranger wrong

22:30 and i sought for a man among them that should make up the
hedg and stand in the gap befor me for the land that i should not
destroy it: but i found none

22:31 therefor have i pour out mine indign upon them; i have
consum them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have i
recompens upon their head saith the lord god

23:1 the word of the lord came again unto me say 23:2 son of man
there were two women the daughter of one mother: 23:3 and they
commit whoredom in egypt; they commit whoredom in their youth:
there were their breast press and there they bruis the teat of
their virgin

23:4 and the name of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her
sister: and they were mine and they bare son and daughter thu
were their names; samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah

23:5 and aholah play the harlot when she wa mine; and she dote on
her lover on the assyrian her neighbour 23:6 which were cloth
with blue captain and ruler all of them desir young men
horsemen ride upon hors

23:7 thu she commit her whoredom with them with all them that
were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted: with
all their idol she defil herself

23:8 neither left she her whoredom brought from egypt: for in her
youth they lay with her and they bruis the breast of her
virgin and pour their whoredom upon her

23:9 wherefor i have deliv her into the hand of her lover into
the hand of the assyrian upon whom she dote

23:10 these discov her nakedness: they took her son and her
daughter and slew her with the sword: and she becam famou among
women; for they had execut judgment upon her

23:11 and when her sister aholibah saw thi she wa more corrupt in
her inordin love than she and in her whoredom more than her
sister in her whoredom

23:12 she dote upon the assyrian her neighbour captain and ruler
cloth most gorgeous horsemen ride upon hors all of them
desir young men

23:13 then i saw that she wa defil that they took both one way
23:14 and that she increas her whoredoms: for when she saw men
pourtray upon the wall the imag of the chaldean pourtray with
vermilion 23:15 gird with girdl upon their loin exceed in
dy attir upon their head all of them princ to look to after
the manner of the babylonian of chaldea the land of their nativity:
23:16 and as soon as she saw them with her eye she dote upon them
and sent messeng unto them into chaldea

23:17 and the babylonian came to her into the bed of love and they
defil her with their whoredom and she wa pollut with them and
her mind wa alien from them

23:18 so she discov her whoredom and discov her nakedness:
then my mind wa alien from her like as my mind wa alien
from her sister

23:19 yet she multipli her whoredom in call to remembr the
day of her youth wherein she had play the harlot in the land of
egypt

23:20 for she dote upon their paramour whose flesh is as the flesh
of ass and whose issu is like the issu of hors

23:21 thu thou calledst to remembr the lewd of thi youth in
bruis thi teat by the egyptian for the pap of thi youth

23:22 therefor o aholibah thu saith the lord god; behold i will
rais up thi lover against thee from whom thi mind is alien and
i will bring them against thee on everi side; 23:23 the babylonian
and all the chaldean pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrian
with them: all of them desir young men captain and ruler great
lord and renown all of them ride upon hors

23:24 and they shall come against thee with chariot wagon and
wheel and with an assembl of peopl which shall set against thee
buckler and shield and helmet round about: and i will set judgment
befor them and they shall judg thee accord to their judgment

23:25 and i will set my jealousi against thee and they shall deal
furious with thee: they shall take away thi nose and thine ears; and
thi remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thi son and thi
daughters; and thi residu shall be devour by the fire

23:26 they shall also strip thee out of thi cloth and take away thi
fair jewel

23:27 thu will i make thi lewd to ceas from thee and thi
whoredom brought from the land of egypt: so that thou shalt not lift
up thine eye unto them nor rememb egypt ani more

23:28 for thu saith the lord god; behold i will deliv thee into
the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thi
mind is alienated: 23:29 and they shall deal with thee hate and
shall take away all thi labour and shall leav thee nake and bare:
and the naked of thi whoredom shall be discov both thi
lewd and thi whoredom

23:30 i will do these thing unto thee becaus thou hast gone a
whore after the heathen and becaus thou art pollut with their
idol

23:31 thou hast walk in the way of thi sister; therefor will i give
her cup into thine hand

23:32 thu saith the lord god; thou shalt drink of thi sister cup
deep and large: thou shalt be laugh to scorn and had in derision; it
containeth much

23:33 thou shalt be fill with drunken and sorrow with the cup
of astonish and desol with the cup of thi sister samaria

23:34 thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break
the sherd thereof and pluck off thine own breasts: for i have spoken
it saith the lord god

23:35 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus thou hast forgotten
me and cast me behind thi back therefor bear thou also thi lewd
and thi whoredom

23:36 the lord said moreov unto me; son of man wilt thou judg
aholah and aholibah? yea declar unto them their abominations; 23:37
that they have commit adulteri and blood is in their hand and
with their idol have they commit adulteri and have also caus
their son whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire
to devour them

23:38 moreov thi they have done unto me: they have defil my
sanctuari in the same day and have profan my sabbath

23:39 for when they had slain their children to their idol then they
came the same day into my sanctuari to profan it; and lo thu have
they done in the midst of mine hous

23:40 and furthermor that ye have sent for men to come from far
unto whom a messeng wa sent; and lo they came: for whom thou
didst wash thyself paintedst thi eye and deckedst thyself with
ornament 23:41 and satest upon a state bed and a tabl prepar
befor it whereupon thou hast set mine incens and mine oil

23:42 and a voic of a multitud be at eas wa with her: and with
the men of the common sort were brought sabean from the wilder
which put bracelet upon their hand and beauti crown upon their
head

23:43 then said i unto her that wa old in adulteri will they now
commit whoredom with her and she with them? 23:44 yet they went in
unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went
they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women

23:45 and the righteou men they shall judg them after the manner of
adulteress and after the manner of women that shed blood; becaus
they are adulteress and blood is in their hand

23:46 for thu saith the lord god; i will bring up a compani upon
them and will give them to be remov and spoil

23:47 and the compani shall stone them with stone and dispatch them
with their swords; they shall slay their son and their daughter and
burn up their hous with fire

23:48 thu will i caus lewd to ceas out of the land that all
women may be taught not to do after your lewd

23:49 and they shall recompens your lewd upon you and ye shall
bear the sin of your idols: and ye shall know that i am the lord god

24:1 again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of
the month the word of the lord came unto me say 24:2 son of man
write thee the name of the day even of thi same day: the king of
babylon set himself against jerusalem thi same day

24:3 and utter a parabl unto the rebelli hous and say unto them
thu saith the lord god; set on a pot set it on and also pour water
into it: 24:4 gather the piec thereof into it even everi good
piec the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with the choic bone

24:5 take the choic of the flock and burn also the bone under it
and make it boil well and let them seeth the bone of it therein

24:6 wherefor thu saith the lord god; woe to the bloodi citi to the
pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring
it out piec by piece; let no lot fall upon it

24:7 for her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of
a rock; she pour it not upon the ground to cover it with dust; 24:8
that it might caus furi to come up to take vengeance; i have set her
blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be cover

24:9 therefor thu saith the lord god; woe to the bloodi city! i will
even make the pile for fire great

24:10 heap on wood kindl the fire consum the flesh and spice it
well and let the bone be burn

24:11 then set it empti upon the coal thereof that the brass of it
may be hot and may burn and that the filthi of it may be molten
in it that the scum of it may be consum

24:12 she hath weari herself with lie and her great scum went not
forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire

24:13 in thi filthi is lewdness: becaus i have purg thee and
thou wast not purg thou shalt not be purg from thi filthi ani
more till i have caus my furi to rest upon thee

24:14 i the lord have spoken it: it shall come to pass and i will do
it; i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent;
accord to thi way and accord to thi do shall they judg
thee saith the lord god

24:15 also the word of the lord came unto me say 24:16 son of
man behold i take away from thee the desir of thine eye with a
stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thi tear
run down

24:17 forbear to cri make no mourn for the dead bind the tire of
thine head upon thee and put on thi shoe upon thi feet and cover
not thi lip and eat not the bread of men

24:18 so i spake unto the peopl in the morning: and at even my wife
died; and i did in the morn as i wa command

24:19 and the peopl said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these
thing are to us that thou doest so? 24:20 then i answer them the
word of the lord came unto me say 24:21 speak unto the hous of
israel thu saith the lord god; behold i will profan my sanctuari
the excel of your strength the desir of your eye and that
which your soul pitieth; and your son and your daughter whom ye have
left shall fall by the sword

24:22 and ye shall do as i have done: ye shall not cover your lip
nor eat the bread of men

24:23 and your tire shall be upon your head and your shoe upon
your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for
your iniqu and mourn one toward anoth

24:24 thu ezekiel is unto you a sign: accord to all that he hath
done shall ye do: and when thi cometh ye shall know that i am the
lord god

24:25 also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take
from them their strength the joy of their glori the desir of their
eye and that whereupon they set their mind their son and their
daughter 24:26 that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto
thee to caus thee to hear it with thine ears? 24:27 in that day
shall thi mouth be open to him which is escap and thou shalt
speak and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and
they shall know that i am the lord

25:1 the word of the lord came again unto me say 25:2 son of man
set thi face against the ammonit and prophesi against them; 25:3
and say unto the ammonit hear the word of the lord god; thu saith
the lord god; becaus thou saidst aha against my sanctuari when it
wa profaned; and against the land of israel when it wa desolate;
and against the hous of judah when they went into captivity; 25:4
behold therefor i will deliv thee to the men of the east for a
possess and they shall set their palac in thee and make their
dwell in thee: they shall eat thi fruit and they shall drink thi
milk

25:5 and i will make rabbah a stabl for camel and the ammonit a
couch place for flocks: and ye shall know that i am the lord

25:6 for thu saith the lord god; becaus thou hast clap thine
hand and stamp with the feet and rejoic in heart with all thi
despit against the land of israel; 25:7 behold therefor i will
stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliv thee for a spoil to
the heathen; and i will cut thee off from the peopl and i will caus
thee to perish out of the countries: i will destroy thee; and thou
shalt know that i am the lord

25:8 thu saith the lord god; becaus that moab and seir do say
behold the hous of judah is like unto all the heathen; 25:9
therefor behold i will open the side of moab from the citi from
hi citi which are on hi frontier the glori of the countri
bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim 25:10 unto the men of the
east with the ammonit and will give them in possess that the
ammonit may not be rememb among the nation

25:11 and i will execut judgment upon moab; and they shall know that
i am the lord

25:12 thu saith the lord god; becaus that edom hath dealt against
the hous of judah by take vengeanc and hath greatli offend and
reveng himself upon them; 25:13 therefor thu saith the lord god; i
will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and
beast from it; and i will make it desol from teman; and they of
dedan shall fall by the sword

25:14 and i will lay my vengeanc upon edom by the hand of my peopl
israel: and they shall do in edom accord to mine anger and
accord to my fury; and they shall know my vengeanc saith the lord
god

25:15 thu saith the lord god; becaus the philistin have dealt by
reveng and have taken vengeanc with a despit heart to destroy
it for the old hatred; 25:16 therefor thu saith the lord god;
behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistin and i will
cut off the cherethim and destroy the remnant of the sea coast

25:17 and i will execut great vengeanc upon them with furiou
rebukes; and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my
vengeanc upon them

26:1 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the
month that the word of the lord came unto me say 26:2 son of

26:4 and they shall destroy the wall of tyru and break down her
towers: i will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the
top of a rock

26:5 it shall be a place for the spread of net in the midst of the
sea: for i have spoken it saith the lord god: and it shall becom a
spoil to the nation

26:6 and her daughter which are in the field shall be slain by the
sword; and they shall know that i am the lord

26:7 for thu saith the lord god; behold i will bring upon tyru
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of king from the north with

26:8 he shall slay with the sword thi daughter in the field: and he
shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and
lift up the buckler against thee

26:9 and he shall set engin of war against thi wall and with hi

26:10 by reason of the abund of hi hors their dust shall cover
thee: thi wall shall shake at the nois of the horsemen and of the

men enter into a citi wherein is made a breach

26:11 with the hoof of hi hors shall he tread down all thi
streets: he shall slay thi peopl by the sword and thi strong
garrison shall go down to the ground

26:12 and they shall make a spoil of thi rich and make a prey of

pleasant houses: and they shall lay thi stone and thi timber and thi
dust in the midst of the water

26:13 and i will caus the nois of thi song to cease; and the sound
of thi harp shall be no more heard

26:14 and i will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
place to spread net upon; thou shalt be built no more: for i the lord

thee as profan out of the mountain of god: and i will destroy thee o
cover cherub from the midst of the stone of fire

28:17 thine heart wa lift up becaus of thi beauti thou hast
corrupt thi wisdom by reason of thi brightness: i will cast thee to

28:18 thou hast defil thi sanctuari by the multitud of thine

forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will
bring thee to ash upon the earth in the sight of all them that

28:19 all they that know thee among the peopl shall be astonish at
thee: thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be ani more

28:20 again the word of the lord came unto me say 28:21 son of
man set thi face against zidon and prophesi against it 28:22 and
say thu saith the lord god; behold i am against thee o zidon; and
i will be glorifi in the midst of thee: and they shall know that i

sanctifi in her

28:23 for i will send into her pestil and blood into her streets;
and the wound shall be judg in the midst of her by the sword upon
her on everi side; and they shall know that i am the lord

28:24 and there shall be no more a prick brier unto the hous of
israel nor ani griev thorn of all that are round about them that
despis them; and they shall know that i am the lord god

28:25 thu saith the lord god; when i shall have gather the hous of
israel from the peopl among whom they are scatter and shall be
sanctifi in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell
in their land that i have given to my servant jacob

28:26 and they shall dwell safe therein and shall build hous and
plant vineyards; yea they shall dwell with confid when i have
execut judgment upon all those that despis them round about them;
and they shall know that i am the lord their god

29:1 in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the
month the word of the lord came unto me say 29:2 son of man set
thi face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesi against him and
against all egypt: 29:3 speak and say thu saith the lord god;
behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon
that lieth in the midst of hi river which hath said my river is
mine own and i have made it for myself

29:4 but i will put hook in thi jaw and i will caus the fish of
thi river to stick unto thi scale and i will bring thee up out of
the midst of thi river and all the fish of thi river shall stick
unto thi scale

29:5 and i will leav thee thrown into the wilder thee and all
the fish of thi rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou
shalt not be brought togeth nor gathered: i have given thee for
meat to the beast of the field and to the fowl of the heaven

29:6 and all the inhabit of egypt shall know that i am the lord
becaus they have been a staff of reed to the hous of israel

29:7 when they took hold of thee by thi hand thou didst break and
rend all their shoulder: and when they lean upon thee thou brakest
and madest all their loin to be at a stand

29:8 therefor thu saith the lord god; behold i will bring a sword
upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee

29:9 and the land of egypt shall be desol and waste; and they shall
know that i am the lord: becaus he hath said the river is mine and
i have made it

29:10 behold therefor i am against thee and against thi river and
i will make the land of egypt utterli wast and desol from the
tower of syen even unto the border of ethiopia

29:11 no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall
pass through it neither shall it be inhabit forti year

29:12 and i will make the land of egypt desol in the midst of the
countri that are desol and her citi among the citi that are
laid wast shall be desol forti years: and i will scatter the
egyptian among the nation and will dispers them through the
countri

29:13 yet thu saith the lord god; at the end of forti year will i
gather the egyptian from the peopl whither they were scattered:
29:14 and i will bring again the captiv of egypt and will caus
them to return into the land of pathro into the land of their
habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom

29:15 it shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
itself ani more abov the nations: for i will diminish them that they
shall no more rule over the nation

29:16 and it shall be no more the confid of the hous of israel
which bringeth their iniqu to remembr when they shall look
after them: but they shall know that i am the lord god

29:17 and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the
first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came
unto me say 29:18 son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
caus hi armi to serv a great servic against tyrus: everi head wa
made bald and everi shoulder wa peeled: yet had he no wage nor hi
armi for tyru for the servic that he had serv against it: 29:19
therefor thu saith the lord god; behold i will give the land of
egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon; and he shall take her
multitud and take her spoil and take her prey; and it shall be the
wage for hi armi

29:20 i have given him the land of egypt for hi labour wherewith he
serv against it becaus they wrought for me saith the lord god

29:21 in that day will i caus the horn of the hous of israel to bud
forth and i will give thee the open of the mouth in the midst of
them; and they shall know that i am the lord

30:1 the word of the lord came again unto me say 30:2 son of man
prophesi and say thu saith the lord god; howl ye woe worth the day!
30:3 for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudi
day; it shall be the time of the heathen

30:4 and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in
ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away
her multitud and her foundat shall be broken down

30:5 ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingl peopl and
chub and the men of the land that is in leagu shall fall with them
by the sword

30:6 thu saith the lord; they also that uphold egypt shall fall; and
the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of syen shall
they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god

30:7 and they shall be desol in the midst of the countri that are
desol and her citi shall be in the midst of the citi that are
wast

30:8 and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in
egypt and when all her helper shall be destroy

30:9 in that day shall messeng go forth from me in ship to make
the careless ethiopian afraid and great pain shall come upon them
as in the day of egypt: for lo it cometh

30:10 thu saith the lord god; i will also make the multitud of egypt
to ceas by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon

30:11 he and hi peopl with him the terribl of the nation shall
be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their sword
against egypt and fill the land with the slain

30:12 and i will make the river dri and sell the land into the hand
of the wicked: and i will make the land wast and all that is
therein by the hand of strangers: i the lord have spoken it

30:13 thu saith the lord god; i will also destroy the idol and i
will caus their imag to ceas out of noph; and there shall be no
more a princ of the land of egypt: and i will put a fear in the land
of egypt

30:14 and i will make pathro desol and will set fire in zoan and
will execut judgment in no

30:15 and i will pour my furi upon sin the strength of egypt; and i
will cut off the multitud of no

30:16 and i will set fire in egypt: sin shall have great pain and no

30:17 the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
and these citi shall go into captiv

30:18 at tehaphneh also the day shall be darken when i shall
break there the yoke of egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall
ceas in her: as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughter
shall go into captiv

30:19 thu will i execut judgment in egypt: and they shall know that
i am the lord

30:20 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in
the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
say 30:21 son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of
egypt; and lo it shall not be bound up to be heal to put a roller
to bind it to make it strong to hold the sword

30:22 therefor thu saith the lord god; behold i am against pharaoh
king of egypt and will break hi arm the strong and that which wa
broken; and i will caus the sword to fall out of hi hand

30:23 and i will scatter the egyptian among the nation and will
dispers them through the countri

30:24 and i will strengthen the arm of the king of babylon and put
my sword in hi hand: but i will break pharaoh arm and he shall
groan befor him with the groan of a deadli wound man

30:25 but i will strengthen the arm of the king of babylon and the
arm of pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that i am the
lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon
and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt

30:26 and i will scatter the egyptian among the nation and dispers
them among the countries; and they shall know that i am the lord

31:1 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in
the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
say 31:2 son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to hi
multitude; whom art thou like in thi greatness? 31:3 behold the
assyrian wa a cedar in lebanon with fair branch and with a
shadow shroud and of an high stature; and hi top wa among the
thick bough

31:4 the water made him great the deep set him up on high with her
river run round about hi plant and sent her littl river unto
all the tree of the field

31:5 therefor hi height wa exalt abov all the tree of the
field and hi bough were multipli and hi branch becam long
becaus of the multitud of water when he shot forth

31:6 all the fowl of heaven made their nest in hi bough and under
hi branch did all the beast of the field bring forth their young
and under hi shadow dwelt all great nation

31:7 thu wa he fair in hi great in the length of hi branches:
for hi root wa by great water

31:8 the cedar in the garden of god could not hide him: the fir tree
were not like hi bough and the chestnut tree were not like hi
branches; nor ani tree in the garden of god wa like unto him in hi
beauti

31:9 i have made him fair by the multitud of hi branches: so that
all the tree of eden that were in the garden of god envi him

31:10 therefor thu saith the lord god; becaus thou hast lift up
thyself in height and he hath shot up hi top among the thick bough
and hi heart is lift up in hi height; 31:11 i have therefor
deliv him into the hand of the mighti one of the heathen; he shall
sure deal with him: i have driven him out for hi wicked

31:12 and stranger the terribl of the nation have cut him off
and have left him: upon the mountain and in all the valley hi
branch are fallen and hi bough are broken by all the river of
the land; and all the peopl of the earth are gone down from hi
shadow and have left him

31:13 upon hi ruin shall all the fowl of the heaven remain and all
the beast of the field shall be upon hi branches: 31:14 to the end
that none of all the tree by the water exalt themselv for their
height neither shoot up their top among the thick bough neither
their tree stand up in their height all that drink water: for they
are all deliv unto death to the nether part of the earth in the
midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit

31:15 thu saith the lord god; in the day when he went down to the
grave i caus a mourning: i cover the deep for him and i
restrain the flood thereof and the great water were stayed: and i
caus lebanon to mourn for him and all the tree of the field
faint for him

31:16 i made the nation to shake at the sound of hi fall when i
cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the
tree of eden the choic and best of lebanon all that drink water
shall be comfort in the nether part of the earth

31:17 they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
with the sword; and they that were hi arm that dwelt under hi
shadow in the midst of the heathen

31:18 to whom art thou thu like in glori and in great among the
tree of eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the tree of eden
unto the nether part of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the
uncircumcis with them that be slain by the sword thi is pharaoh
and all hi multitud saith the lord god

32:1 and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in
the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
say 32:2 son of man take up a lament for pharaoh king of
egypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nation
and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thi
river and troubledst the water with thi feet and fouledst their
river

32:3 thu saith the lord god; i will therefor spread out my net over
thee with a compani of mani people; and they shall bring thee up in my
net

32:4 then will i leav thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon
the open field and will caus all the fowl of the heaven to remain
upon thee and i will fill the beast of the whole earth with thee

32:5 and i will lay thi flesh upon the mountain and fill the valley
with thi height

32:6 i will also water with thi blood the land wherein thou swimmest
even to the mountains; and the river shall be full of thee

32:7 and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and make
the star thereof dark; i will cover the sun with a cloud and the
moon shall not give her light

32:8 all the bright light of heaven will i make dark over thee and
set dark upon thi land saith the lord god

32:9 i will also vex the heart of mani peopl when i shall bring thi
destruct among the nation into the countri which thou hast not
known

32:10 yea i will make mani peopl amaz at thee and their king
shall be horribl afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword
befor them; and they shall trembl at everi moment everi man for hi
own life in the day of thi fall

32:11 for thu saith the lord god; the sword of the king of babylon
shall come upon thee

32:12 by the sword of the mighti will i caus thi multitud to fall
the terribl of the nation all of them: and they shall spoil the
pomp of egypt and all the multitud thereof shall be destroy

32:13 i will destroy also all the beast thereof from besid the great
waters; neither shall the foot of man troubl them ani more nor the
hoof of beast troubl them

32:14 then will i make their water deep and caus their river to
run like oil saith the lord god

32:15 when i shall make the land of egypt desol and the countri
shall be destitut of that whereof it wa full when i shall smite all
them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord

32:16 thi is the lament wherewith they shall lament her: the
daughter of the nation shall lament her: they shall lament for her
even for egypt and for all her multitud saith the lord god

32:17 it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day
of the month that the word of the lord came unto me say 32:18
son of man wail for the multitud of egypt and cast them down even
her and the daughter of the famou nation unto the nether part of
the earth with them that go down into the pit

32:19 whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down and be thou laid with
the uncircumcis

32:20 they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
sword: she is deliv to the sword: draw her and all her multitud

32:21 the strong among the mighti shall speak to him out of the midst
of hell with them that help him: they are gone down they lie
uncircumcis slain by the sword

32:22 asshur is there and all her company: hi grave are about him:
all of them slain fallen by the sword: 32:23 whose grave are set in
the side of the pit and her compani is round about her grave: all of
them slain fallen by the sword which caus terror in the land of
the live

32:24 there is elam and all her multitud round about her grave all
of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcis
into the nether part of the earth which caus their terror in the
land of the living; yet have they born their shame with them that go
down to the pit

32:25 they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
multitude: her grave are round about him: all of them uncircumcis
slain by the sword: though their terror wa caus in the land of the
live yet have they born their shame with them that go down to the
pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain

32:26 there is meshech tubal and all her multitude: her grave are
round about him: all of them uncircumcis slain by the sword though
they caus their terror in the land of the live

32:27 and they shall not lie with the mighti that are fallen of the
uncircumcis which are gone down to hell with their weapon of war:
and they have laid their sword under their head but their
iniqu shall be upon their bone though they were the terror of
the mighti in the land of the live

32:28 yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcis and
shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword

32:29 there is edom her king and all her princ which with their
might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie
with the uncircumcis and with them that go down to the pit

32:30 there be the princ of the north all of them and all the
zidonian which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they
are asham of their might; and they lie uncircumcis with them that
be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to
the pit

32:31 pharaoh shall see them and shall be comfort over all hi
multitud even pharaoh and all hi armi slain by the sword saith the
lord god

32:32 for i have caus my terror in the land of the living: and he
shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcis with them that are
slain with the sword even pharaoh and all hi multitud saith the
lord god

33:1 again the word of the lord came unto me say 33:2 son of man
speak to the children of thi peopl and say unto them when i bring
the sword upon a land if the peopl of the land take a man of their
coast and set him for their watchman: 33:3 if when he seeth the
sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people;
33:4 then whosoev heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not
warning; if the sword come and take him away hi blood shall be upon
hi own head

33:5 he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning; hi
blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warn shall deliv hi
soul

33:6 but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet
and the peopl be not warned; if the sword come and take ani person
from among them he is taken away in hi iniquity; but hi blood will
i requir at the watchman hand

33:7 so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the hous
of israel; therefor thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn
them from me

33:8 when i say unto the wick o wick man thou shalt sure die;
if thou dost not speak to warn the wick from hi way that wick
man shall die in hi iniquity; but hi blood will i requir at thine
hand

33:9 nevertheless if thou warn the wick of hi way to turn from it;
if he do not turn from hi way he shall die in hi iniquity; but thou
hast deliv thi soul

33:10 therefor o thou son of man speak unto the hous of israel;
thu ye speak say if our transgress and our sin be upon us
and we pine away in them how should we then live? 33:11 say unto
them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasur in the death
of the wicked; but that the wick turn from hi way and live: turn
ye turn ye from your evil ways; for whi will ye die o hous of
israel? 33:12 therefor thou son of man say unto the children of
thi peopl the righteous of the righteou shall not deliv him
in the day of hi transgression: as for the wicked of the wick
he shall not fall therebi in the day that he turneth from hi
wickedness; neither shall the righteou be abl to live for hi
righteous in the day that he sinneth

33:13 when i shall say to the righteou that he shall sure live; if
he trust to hi own righteous and commit iniqu all hi
righteous shall not be remembered; but for hi iniqu that he
hath commit he shall die for it

33:14 again when i say unto the wick thou shalt sure die; if he
turn from hi sin and do that which is law and right; 33:15 if the
wick restor the pledg give again that he had rob walk in the
statut of life without commit iniquity; he shall sure live
he shall not die

33:16 none of hi sin that he hath commit shall be mention unto
him: he hath done that which is law and right; he shall sure
live

33:17 yet the children of thi peopl say the way of the lord is not
equal: but as for them their way is not equal

33:18 when the righteou turneth from hi righteous and
committeth iniqu he shall even die therebi

33:19 but if the wick turn from hi wicked and do that which is
law and right he shall live therebi

33:20 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye hous of
israel i will judg you everi one after hi way

33:21 and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captiv in the
tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escap
out of jerusalem came unto me say the citi is smitten

33:22 now the hand of the lord wa upon me in the even afor he
that wa escap came; and had open my mouth until he came to me in
the morning; and my mouth wa open and i wa no more dumb

33:23 then the word of the lord came unto me say 33:24 son of
man they that inhabit those wast of the land of israel speak
say abraham wa one and he inherit the land: but we are many;
the land is given us for inherit

33:25 wherefor say unto them thu saith the lord god; ye eat with
the blood and lift up your eye toward your idol and shed blood:
and shall ye possess the land? 33:26 ye stand upon your sword ye
work abomin and ye defil everi one hi neighbour wife: and
shall ye possess the land? 33:27 say thou thu unto them thu saith
the lord god; as i live sure they that are in the wast shall fall
by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the
beast to be devour and they that be in the fort and in the cave
shall die of the pestil

33:28 for i will lay the land most desol and the pomp of her
strength shall cease; and the mountain of israel shall be desol
that none shall pass through

33:29 then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the
land most desol becaus of all their abomin which they have
commit

33:30 also thou son of man the children of thi peopl still are
talk against thee by the wall and in the door of the hous and
speak one to anoth everi one to hi brother say come i pray
you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord

33:31 and they come unto thee as the peopl cometh and they sit
befor thee as my peopl and they hear thi word but they will not
do them: for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart
goeth after their covet

33:32 and lo thou art unto them as a veri love song of one that
hath a pleasant voic and can play well on an instrument: for they
hear thi word but they do them not

33:33 and when thi cometh to pass (lo it will come) then shall
they know that a prophet hath been among them

34:1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 34:2 son of man
prophesi against the shepherd of israel prophesi and say unto them
thu saith the lord god unto the shepherds; woe be to the shepherd of
israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherd feed the
flocks? 34:3 ye eat the fat and ye cloth you with the wool ye kill
them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock

34:4 the diseas have ye not strengthen neither have ye heal
that which wa sick neither have ye bound up that which wa broken
neither have ye brought again that which wa driven away neither have
ye sought that which wa lost; but with forc and with cruelti have ye
rule them

34:5 and they were scatter becaus there is no shepherd: and they
becam meat to all the beast of the field when they were scatter

34:6 my sheep wander through all the mountain and upon everi high
hill: yea my flock wa scatter upon all the face of the earth and
none did search or seek after them

34:7 therefor ye shepherd hear the word of the lord; 34:8 as i
live saith the lord god sure becaus my flock becam a prey and
my flock becam meat to everi beast of the field becaus there wa no
shepherd neither did my shepherd search for my flock but the
shepherd fed themselv and fed not my flock; 34:9 therefor o ye
shepherd hear the word of the lord; 34:10 thu saith the lord god;
behold i am against the shepherds; and i will requir my flock at
their hand and caus them to ceas from feed the flock; neither
shall the shepherd feed themselv ani more; for i will deliv my
flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them

34:11 for thu saith the lord god; behold i even i will both search
my sheep and seek them out

34:12 as a shepherd seeketh out hi flock in the day that he is among
hi sheep that are scattered; so will i seek out my sheep and will
deliv them out of all place where they have been scatter in the
cloudi and dark day

34:13 and i will bring them out from the peopl and gather them from
the countri and will bring them to their own land and feed them
upon the mountain of israel by the river and in all the inhabit
place of the countri

34:14 i will feed them in a good pastur and upon the high mountain
of israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold
and in a fat pastur shall they feed upon the mountain of israel

34:15 i will feed my flock and i will caus them to lie down saith
the lord god

34:16 i will seek that which wa lost and bring again that which wa
driven away and will bind up that which wa broken and will
strengthen that which wa sick: but i will destroy the fat and the
strong; i will feed them with judgment

34:17 and as for you o my flock thu saith the lord god; behold i
judg between cattl and cattl between the ram and the he goat

34:18 seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
pastur but ye must tread down with your feet the residu of your
pastures? and to have drunk of the deep water but ye must foul the
residu with your feet? 34:19 and as for my flock they eat that
which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye
have foul with your feet

34:20 therefor thu saith the lord god unto them; behold i even i
will judg between the fat cattl and between the lean cattl

34:21 becaus ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and push
all the diseas with your horn till ye have scatter them abroad;
34:22 therefor will i save my flock and they shall no more be a
prey; and i will judg between cattl and cattl

34:23 and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed
them even my servant david; he shall feed them and he shall be their
shepherd

34:24 and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a princ
among them; i the lord have spoken it

34:25 and i will make with them a coven of peac and will caus
the evil beast to ceas out of the land: and they shall dwell safe
in the wilder and sleep in the wood

34:26 and i will make them and the place round about my hill a
blessing; and i will caus the shower to come down in hi season;
there shall be shower of bless

34:27 and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth
shall yield her increas and they shall be safe in their land and
shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the band of their
yoke and deliv them out of the hand of those that serv
themselv of them

34:28 and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall
the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safe and
none shall make them afraid

34:29 and i will rais up for them a plant of renown and they shall
be no more consum with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of
the heathen ani more

34:30 thu shall they know that i the lord their god am with them and
that they even the hous of israel are my peopl saith the lord
god

of the vessel of the hous of god: which he carri into the land of
shinar to the hous of hi god; and he brought the vessel into the
treasur hous of hi god

1:3 and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of hi eunuch that
he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the king
seed and of the princes; 1:4 children in whom wa no blemish but
well favour and skil in all wisdom and cun in knowledg
and understand scienc and such as had abil in them to stand in
the king palac and whom they might teach the learn and the
tongu of the chaldean

1:5 and the king appoint them a daili provis of the king meat
and of the wine which he drank: so nourish them three year that
at the end thereof they might stand befor the king

1:6 now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah
mishael and azariah: 1:7 unto whom the princ of the eunuch gave
names: for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar; and to
hananiah of shadrach; and to mishael of meshach; and to azariah of
abednego

1:8 but daniel purpos in hi heart that he would not defil himself
with the portion of the king meat nor with the wine which he drank:
therefor he request of the princ of the eunuch that he might not
defil himself

1:9 now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the
princ of the eunuch

1:10 and the princ of the eunuch said unto daniel i fear my lord
the king who hath appoint your meat and your drink: for whi should
he see your face wors like than the children which are of your
sort? then shall ye make me endang my head to the king

1:11 then said daniel to melzar whom the princ of the eunuch had
set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah 1:12 prove thi
servant i beseech thee ten days; and let them give us puls to eat
and water to drink

1:13 then let our counten be look upon befor thee and the
counten of the children that eat of the portion of the king
meat: and as thou seest deal with thi servant

1:14 so he consent to them in thi matter and prove them ten day

1:15 and at the end of ten day their counten appear fairer and
fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
king meat

1:16 thu melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine
that they should drink; and gave them puls

1:17 as for these four children god gave them knowledg and skill in
all learn and wisdom: and daniel had understand in all vision
and dream

1:18 now at the end of the day that the king had said he should bring
them in then the princ of the eunuch brought them in befor
nebuchadnezzar

1:19 and the king commun with them; and among them all wa found
none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah: therefor stood they
befor the king

1:20 and in all matter of wisdom and understand that the king
enquir of them he found them ten time better than all the
magician and astrolog that were in all hi realm

1:21 and daniel continu even unto the first year of king cyru

2:1 and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar
nebuchadnezzar dream dream wherewith hi spirit wa troubl and
hi sleep brake from him

2:2 then the king command to call the magician and the
astrolog and the sorcer and the chaldean for to shew the
king hi dream so they came and stood befor the king

2:3 and the king said unto them i have dream a dream and my spirit
wa troubl to know the dream

2:4 then spake the chaldean to the king in syriack o king live for
ever: tell thi servant the dream and we will shew the
interpret

2:5 the king answer and said to the chaldean the thing is gone
from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the
interpret thereof ye shall be cut in piec and your hous
shall be made a dunghil

2:6 but if ye shew the dream and the interpret thereof ye shall
receiv of me gift and reward and great honour: therefor shew me

2:7 they answer again and said let the king tell hi servant the
dream and we will shew the interpret of it

2:8 the king answer and said i know of certainti that ye would gain
the time becaus ye see the thing is gone from me

2:9 but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one
decre for you: for ye have prepar lie and corrupt word to speak
befor me till the time be changed: therefor tell me the dream and
i shall know that ye can shew me the interpret thereof

2:10 the chaldean answer befor the king and said there is not a
man upon the earth that can shew the king matter: therefor there is
no king lord nor ruler that ask such thing at ani magician or
astrolog or chaldean

2:11 and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none
other that can shew it befor the king except the god whose
dwell is not with flesh

2:12 for thi caus the king wa angri and veri furiou and command
to destroy all the wise men of babylon

2:13 and the decre went forth that the wise men should be slain; and
they sought daniel and hi fellow to be slain

2:14 then daniel answer with counsel and wisdom to arioch the
captain of the king guard which wa gone forth to slay the wise men
of babylon: 2:15 he answer and said to arioch the king captain
whi is the decre so hasti from the king? then arioch made the thing
known to daniel

2:16 then daniel went in and desir of the king that he would give
him time and that he would shew the king the interpret

2:17 then daniel went to hi hous and made the thing known to
hananiah mishael and azariah hi companions: 2:18 that they would
desir merci of the god of heaven concern thi secret; that
daniel and hi fellow should not perish with the rest of the wise men
of babylon

2:19 then wa the secret reveal unto daniel in a night vision then
daniel bless the god of heaven

2:20 daniel answer and said bless be the name of god for ever and
ever: for wisdom and might are his: 2:21 and he changeth the time and
the seasons: he removeth king and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom
unto the wise and knowledg to them that know understanding: 2:22 he
revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the
dark and the light dwelleth with him

2:23 i thank thee and prais thee o thou god of my father who hast
given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we
desir of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king
matter

2:24 therefor daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordain
to destroy the wise men of babylon: he went and said thu unto him;
destroy not the wise men of babylon: bring me in befor the king and
i will shew unto the king the interpret

2:25 then arioch brought in daniel befor the king in hast and said
thu unto him i have found a man of the captiv of judah that will
make known unto the king the interpret

2:26 the king answer and said to daniel whose name wa
belteshazzar art thou abl to make known unto me the dream which i
have seen and the interpret thereof? 2:27 daniel answer in
the presenc of the king and said the secret which the king hath
demand cannot the wise men the astrolog the magician the
soothsay shew unto the king; 2:28 but there is a god in heaven
that revealeth secret and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar
what shall be in the latter day thi dream and the vision of thi
head upon thi bed are these; 2:29 as for thee o king thi thought
came into thi mind upon thi bed what should come to pass hereafter:
and he that revealeth secret maketh known to thee what shall come to
pass

2:30 but as for me thi secret is not reveal to me for ani wisdom
that i have more than ani live but for their sake that shall make
known the interpret to the king and that thou mightest know the
thought of thi heart

2:31 thou o king sawest and behold a great imag thi great imag
whose bright wa excel stood befor thee; and the form
thereof wa terribl

2:32 thi imag head wa of fine gold hi breast and hi arm of
silver hi belli and hi thigh of brass 2:33 hi leg of iron hi
feet part of iron and part of clay

2:34 thou sawest till that a stone wa cut out without hand which
smote the imag upon hi feet that were of iron and clay and brake
them to piec

2:35 then wa the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold
broken to piec togeth and becam like the chaff of the summer
threshingfloors; and the wind carri them away that no place wa
found for them: and the stone that smote the imag becam a great
mountain and fill the whole earth

2:36 thi is the dream; and we will tell the interpret thereof
befor the king

2:37 thou o king art a king of kings: for the god of heaven hath
given thee a kingdom power and strength and glori

2:38 and wheresoev the children of men dwell the beast of the
field and the fowl of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and
hath made thee ruler over them all thou art thi head of gold

2:39 and after thee shall aris anoth kingdom inferior to thee and
anoth third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the
earth

2:40 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
breaketh in piec and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh
all these shall it break in piec and bruis

2:41 and wherea thou sawest the feet and toe part of potter clay
and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in
it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
mix with miri clay

2:42 and as the toe of the feet were part of iron and part of clay
so the kingdom shall be partli strong and partli broken

2:43 and wherea thou sawest iron mix with miri clay they shall
mingl themselv with the seed of men: but they shall not cleav one
to anoth even as iron is not mix with clay

2:44 and in the day of these king shall the god of heaven set up a
kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
left to other peopl but it shall break in piec and consum all
these kingdom and it shall stand for ever

2:45 forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone wa cut out of the
mountain without hand and that it brake in piec the iron the
brass the clay the silver and the gold; the great god hath made
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is
certain and the interpret thereof sure

2:46 then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon hi face and worship
daniel and command that they should offer an oblat and sweet
odour unto him

2:47 the king answer unto daniel and said of a truth it is that
your god is a god of god and a lord of king and a reveal of
secret see thou couldest reveal thi secret

2:48 then the king made daniel a great man and gave him mani great
gift and made him ruler over the whole provinc of babylon and
chief of the governor over all the wise men of babylon

2:49 then daniel request of the king and he set shadrach meshach
and abednego over the affair of the provinc of babylon: but daniel
sat in the gate of the king

3:1 nebuchadnezzar the king made an imag of gold whose height wa
threescor cubit and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in
the plain of dura in the provinc of babylon

3:2 then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather togeth the princ
the governor and the captain the judg the treasur the
counsellor the sheriff and all the ruler of the provinc to
come to the dedic of the imag which nebuchadnezzar the king had
set up

3:3 then the princ the governor and captain the judg the
treasur the counsellor the sheriff and all the ruler of the
provinc were gather togeth unto the dedic of the imag
that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood befor the
imag that nebuchadnezzar had set up

3:4 then an herald cri aloud to you it is command o peopl
nation and languag 3:5 that at what time ye hear the sound of the
cornet flute harp sackbut psalteri dulcim and all kind of
musick ye fall down and worship the golden imag that nebuchadnezzar

shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burn fieri furnac

3:7 therefor at that time when all the peopl heard the sound of the
cornet flute harp sackbut psalteri and all kind of musick all
the peopl the nation and the languag fell down and worship
the golden imag that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up

3:8 wherefor at that time certain chaldean came near and accus

3:9 they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for
ever

3:10 thou o king hast made a decre that everi man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psalteri and dulcim
and all kind of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image:
3:11 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be

3:12 there are certain jew whom thou hast set over the affair of the
provinc of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego; these men o
king have not regard thee: they serv not thi god nor worship the
golden imag which thou hast set up

3:13 then nebuchadnezzar in hi rage and furi command to bring
shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men befor
the king

3:14 nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach
meshach and abednego do not ye serv my god nor worship the golden
imag which i have set up? 3:15 now if ye be readi that at what time
ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psalteri and
dulcim and all kind of musick ye fall down and worship the imag
which i have made; well: but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the
same hour into the midst of a burn fieri furnace; and who is that
god that shall deliv you out of my hands? 3:16 shadrach meshach
and abednego answer and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are
not care to answer thee in thi matter

3:17 if it be so our god whom we serv is abl to deliv us from the
burn fieri furnac and he will deliv us out of thine hand o
king

3:18 but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serv
thi god nor worship the golden imag which thou hast set up

3:19 then wa nebuchadnezzar full of furi and the form of hi visag
wa chang against shadrach meshach and abednego: therefor he
spake and command that they should heat the furnac one seven time
more than it wa wont to be heat

3:20 and he command the most mighti men that were in hi armi to
bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the
burn fieri furnac

3:21 then these men were bound in their coat their hosen and their
hat and their other garment and were cast into the midst of the
burn fieri furnac

3:22 therefor becaus the king command wa urgent and the
furnac exceed hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took
up shadrach meshach and abednego

3:23 and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down
bound into the midst of the burn fieri furnac

3:24 then nebuchadnezzar the king wa astoni and rose up in hast
and spake and said unto hi counsellor did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire? they answer and said unto the
king true o king

3:25 he answer and said lo i see four men loos walk in the
midst of the fire and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth

3:26 then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burn fieri
furnac and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye
servant of the most high god come forth and come hither then
shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire

3:27 and the princ governor and captain and the king
counsellor be gather togeth saw these men upon whose bodi
the fire had no power nor wa an hair of their head sing neither
were their coat chang nor the smell of fire had pass on them

3:28 then nebuchadnezzar spake and said bless be the god of
shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent hi angel and
deliv hi servant that trust in him and have chang the
king word and yield their bodi that they might not serv nor
worship ani god except their own god

3:29 therefor i make a decre that everi peopl nation and
languag which speak ani thing amiss against the god of shadrach
meshach and abednego shall be cut in piec and their hous shall
be made a dunghill: becaus there is no other god that can deliv

3:30 then the king promot shadrach meshach and abednego in the

4:4 i nebuchadnezzar wa at rest in mine hous and flourish in my
palace: 4:5 i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thought upon
my bed and the vision of my head troubl me

4:6 therefor made i a decre to bring in all the wise men of babylon
befor me that they might make known unto me the interpret of
the dream

4:7 then came in the magician the astrolog the chaldean and
the soothsayers: and i told the dream befor them; but they did not
make known unto me the interpret thereof

4:8 but at the last daniel came in befor me whose name wa
belteshazzar accord to the name of my god and in whom is the
spirit of the holi gods: and befor him i told the dream say 4:9
o belteshazzar master of the magician becaus i know that the
spirit of the holi god is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell
me the vision of my dream that i have seen and the interpret
thereof

4:10 thu were the vision of mine head in my bed; i saw and behold a
tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof wa great

4:11 the tree grew and wa strong and the height thereof reach
unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 4:12
the leav thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it
wa meat for all: the beast of the field had shadow under it and the
fowl of the heaven dwelt in the bough thereof and all flesh wa fed
of it

4:13 i saw in the vision of my head upon my bed and behold a
watcher and an holi one came down from heaven; 4:14 he cri aloud
and said thu hew down the tree and cut off hi branch shake off
hi leav and scatter hi fruit: let the beast get away from under
it and the fowl from hi branches: 4:15 nevertheless leav the stump
of hi root in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the
tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven
and let hi portion be with the beast in the grass of the earth: 4:16
let hi heart be chang from man and let a beast heart be given
unto him; and let seven time pass over him

4:17 thi matter is by the decre of the watcher and the demand by
the word of the holi ones: to the intent that the live may know that
the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to
whomsoev he will and setteth up over it the basest of men

4:18 thi dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o
belteshazzar declar the interpret thereof forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not abl to make known unto me the
interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holi god is
in thee

4:19 then daniel whose name wa belteshazzar wa astoni for one
hour and hi thought troubl him the king spake and said
belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpret thereof
troubl thee belteshazzar answer and said my lord the dream be to
them that hate thee and the interpret thereof to thine enemi

4:20 the tree that thou sawest which grew and wa strong whose
height reach unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the
earth; 4:21 whose leav were fair and the fruit thereof much and in
it wa meat for all; under which the beast of the field dwelt and
upon whose branch the fowl of the heaven had their habitation: 4:22
it is thou o king that art grown and becom strong: for thi
great is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thi dominion to the
end of the earth

4:23 and wherea the king saw a watcher and an holi one come down
from heaven and say hew the tree down and destroy it; yet leav
the stump of the root thereof in the earth even with a band of iron
and brass in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with
the dew of heaven and let hi portion be with the beast of the
field till seven time pass over him; 4:24 thi is the
interpret o king and thi is the decre of the most high which

5:15 and now the wise men the astrolog have been brought in

5:20 but when hi heart wa lift up and hi mind harden in pride
he wa depos from hi kingli throne and they took hi glori from

made like the beast and hi dwell wa with the wild asses: they
fed him with grass like oxen and hi bodi wa wet with the dew of

5:22 and thou hi son o belshazzar hast not humbl thine heart
though thou knewest all this; 5:23 but hast lift up thyself against
the lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessel of hi hous
befor thee and thou and thi lord thi wive and thi concubin
have drunk wine in them; and thou hast prais the god of silver and
gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor

5:25 and thi is the write that wa written mene mene tekel

5:26 thi is the interpret of the thing: mene; god hath number
thi kingdom and finish it

5:27 tekel; thou art weigh in the balanc and art found want

5:28 peres; thi kingdom is divid and given to the mede and
persian

5:29 then command belshazzar and they cloth daniel with scarlet
and put a chain of gold about hi neck and made a proclam
concern him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom

5:30 in that night wa belshazzar the king of the chaldean slain

5:31 and dariu the median took the kingdom be about threescor
and two year old

6:1 it pleas dariu to set over the kingdom an hundr and twenti
princ which should be over the whole kingdom; 6:2 and over these

give account unto them and the king should have no damag

6:3 then thi daniel wa prefer abov the presid and princ
becaus an excel spirit wa in him; and the king thought to set
him over the whole realm

6:4 then the presid and princ sought to find occas against
daniel concern the kingdom; but they could find none occas nor
fault; forasmuch as he wa faith neither wa there ani error or
fault found in him

6:5 then said these men we shall not find ani occas against thi
daniel except we find it against him concern the law of hi god

6:6 then these presid and princ assembl togeth to the king
and said thu unto him king dariu live for ever

6:7 all the presid of the kingdom the governor and the princ
the counsellor and the captain have consult togeth to
establish a royal statut and to make a firm decre that whosoev

6:13 then answer they and said befor the king that daniel which
is of the children of the captiv of judah regardeth not thee o

three time a day

6:14 then the king when he heard these word wa sore displeas
with himself and set hi heart on daniel to deliv him: and he
labour till the go down of the sun to deliv him

6:15 then these men assembl unto the king and said unto the king

6:16 then the king command and they brought daniel and cast him

6:17 and a stone wa brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and
the king seal it with hi own signet and with the signet of hi

6:18 then the king went to hi palac and pass the night fasting:
neither were instrument of musick brought befor him: and hi sleep

6:19 then the king aros veri earli in the morn and went in hast
unto the den of lion

6:20 and when he came to the den he cri with a lament voic

6:22 my god hath sent hi angel and hath shut the lion mouth that
they have not hurt me: forasmuch as befor him innoc wa found in

6:23 then wa the king exceedingli glad for him and command that
they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel wa taken up out

6:24 and the king command and they brought those men which had
accus daniel and they cast them into the den of lion them their
children and their wives; and the lion had the masteri of them and
brake all their bone in piec or ever they came at the bottom of the

6:25 then king dariu wrote unto all peopl nation and languag
that dwell in all the earth; peac be multipli unto you

6:26 i make a decre that in everi dominion of my kingdom men trembl
and fear befor the god of daniel: for he is the live god and

and hi dominion shall be even unto the end

6:27 he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh sign and wonder in
heaven and in earth who hath deliv daniel from the power of the
lion

6:28 so thi daniel prosper in the reign of dariu and in the reign
of cyru the persian

7:1 in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream
and vision of hi head upon hi bed: then he wrote the dream and
told the sum of the matter

7:2 daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold
the four wind of the heaven strove upon the great sea

7:3 and four great beast came up from the sea divers one from
anoth

7:4 the first wa like a lion and had eagl wings: i beheld till
the wing thereof were pluck and it wa lift up from the earth
and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man heart wa given to
it

7:5 and behold anoth beast a second like to a bear and it rais
up itself on one side and it had three rib in the mouth of it
between the teeth of it: and they said thu unto it aris devour
much flesh

7:6 after thi i beheld and lo anoth like a leopard which had
upon the back of it four wing of a fowl; the beast had also four
heads; and dominion wa given to it

7:7 after thi i saw in the night vision and behold a fourth beast
dread and terribl and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
teeth: it devour and brake in piec and stamp the residu with
the feet of it: and it wa divers from all the beast that were
befor it; and it had ten horn

7:8 i consid the horn and behold there came up among them
anoth littl horn befor whom there were three of the first horn
pluck up by the roots: and behold in thi horn were eye like the
eye of man and a mouth speak great thing

7:9 i beheld till the throne were cast down and the ancient of day
did sit whose garment wa white as snow and the hair of hi head
like the pure wool: hi throne wa like the fieri flame and hi
wheel as burn fire

7:10 a fieri stream issu and came forth from befor him: thousand
thousand minist unto him and ten thousand time ten thousand
stood befor him: the judgment wa set and the book were open

7:11 i beheld then becaus of the voic of the great word which the
horn spake: i beheld even till the beast wa slain and hi bodi
destroy and given to the burn flame

7:12 as concern the rest of the beast they had their dominion
taken away: yet their live were prolong for a season and time

7:13 i saw in the night vision and behold one like the son of man
came with the cloud of heaven and came to the ancient of day and
they brought him near befor him

7:14 and there wa given him dominion and glori and a kingdom that
all peopl nation and languag should serv him: hi dominion is
an everlast dominion which shall not pass away and hi kingdom
that which shall not be destroy

7:15 i daniel wa griev in my spirit in the midst of my bodi and
the vision of my head troubl me

7:16 i came near unto one of them that stood by and ask him the
truth of all thi so he told me and made me know the interpret
of the thing

7:17 these great beast which are four are four king which shall
aris out of the earth

7:18 but the saint of the most high shall take the kingdom and
possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever

7:19 then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which wa
divers from all the other exceed dread whose teeth were of
iron and hi nail of brass; which devour brake in piec and
stamp the residu with hi feet; 7:20 and of the ten horn that were
in hi head and of the other which came up and befor whom three
fell; even of that horn that had eye and a mouth that spake veri
great thing whose look wa more stout than hi fellow

7:21 i beheld and the same horn made war with the saint and
prevail against them; 7:22 until the ancient of day came and
judgment wa given to the saint of the most high; and the time came
that the saint possess the kingdom

7:23 thu he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth which shall be divers from all kingdom and shall devour the
whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in piec

7:24 and the ten horn out of thi kingdom are ten king that shall
arise: and anoth shall rise after them; and he shall be divers from
the first and he shall subdu three king

7:25 and he shall speak great word against the most high and shall
wear out the saint of the most high and think to chang time and
laws: and they shall be given into hi hand until a time and time and
the divid of time

7:26 but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away hi
dominion to consum and to destroy it unto the end

7:27 and the kingdom and dominion and the great of the kingdom
under the whole heaven shall be given to the peopl of the saint of
the most high whose kingdom is an everlast kingdom and all
dominion shall serv and obey him

7:28 hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel my
cogit much troubl me and my counten chang in me: but i
kept the matter in my heart

8:1 in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision
appear unto me even unto me daniel after that which appear unto
me at the first

8:2 and i saw in a vision; and it came to pass when i saw that i wa
at shushan in the palac which is in the provinc of elam; and i saw
in a vision and i wa by the river of ulai

8:3 then i lift up mine eye and saw and behold there stood
befor the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horn were
high; but one wa higher than the other and the higher came up last

8:4 i saw the ram push westward and northward and southward; so
that no beast might stand befor him neither wa there ani that
could deliv out of hi hand; but he did accord to hi will and
becam great

8:5 and as i wa consid behold an he goat came from the west on
the face of the whole earth and touch not the ground: and the goat
had a notabl horn between hi eye

8:6 and he came to the ram that had two horn which i had seen
stand befor the river and ran unto him in the furi of hi power

8:7 and i saw him come close unto the ram and he wa move with
choler against him and smote the ram and brake hi two horns: and
there wa no power in the ram to stand befor him but he cast him
down to the ground and stamp upon him: and there wa none that
could deliv the ram out of hi hand

8:8 therefor the he goat wax veri great: and when he wa strong
the great horn wa broken; and for it came up four notabl one toward
the four wind of heaven

8:9 and out of one of them came forth a littl horn which wax
exceed great toward the south and toward the east and toward the
pleasant land

8:10 and it wax great even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the host and of the star to the ground and stamp upon
them

8:11 yea he magnifi himself even to the princ of the host and by
him the daili sacrific wa taken away and the place of the sanctuari
wa cast down

8:12 and an host wa given him against the daili sacrific by reason
of transgress and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practis and prosper

8:13 then i heard one saint speak and anoth saint said unto that
certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concern the
daili sacrific and the transgress of desol to give both the
sanctuari and the host to be trodden under foot? 8:14 and he said
unto me unto two thousand and three hundr days; then shall the
sanctuari be cleans

8:15 and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision
and sought for the mean then behold there stood befor me as the
appear of a man

8:16 and i heard a man voic between the bank of ulai which
call and said gabriel make thi man to understand the vision

8:17 so he came near where i stood: and when he came i wa afraid
and fell upon my face: but he said unto me understand o son of man:
for at the time of the end shall be the vision

8:18 now as he wa speak with me i wa in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground: but he touch me and set me upright

8:19 and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the
last end of the indignation: for at the time appoint the end shall
be

8:20 the ram which thou sawest have two horn are the king of media
and persia

8:21 and the rough goat is the king of grecia: and the great horn that
is between hi eye is the first king

8:22 now that be broken wherea four stood up for it four
kingdom shall stand up out of the nation but not in hi power

8:23 and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressor
are come to the full a king of fierc counten and understand
dark sentenc shall stand up

8:24 and hi power shall be mighti but not by hi own power: and he
shall destroy wonder and shall prosper and practis and shall
destroy the mighti and the holi peopl

8:25 and through hi polici also he shall caus craft to prosper in
hi hand; and he shall magnifi himself in hi heart and by peac
shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the princ of
princes; but he shall be broken without hand

8:26 and the vision of the even and the morn which wa told is
true: wherefor shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for mani
day

8:27 and i daniel faint and wa sick certain days; afterward i rose
up and did the king business; and i wa astonish at the vision
but none understood it

9:1 in the first year of dariu the son of ahasueru of the seed of
the mede which wa made king over the realm of the chaldeans; 9:2 in
the first year of hi reign i daniel understood by book the number of
the year whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet
that he would accomplish seventi year in the desol of
jerusalem

9:3 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and
supplic with fast and sackcloth and ashes: 9:4 and i
pray unto the lord my god and made my confess and said o lord
the great and dread god keep the coven and merci to them
that love him and to them that keep hi commandments; 9:5 we have
sin and have commit iniqu and have done wickedli and have
rebel even by depart from thi precept and from thi judgments:
9:6 neither have we hearken unto thi servant the prophet which
spake in thi name to our king our princ and our father and to
all the peopl of the land

9:7 o lord righteous belongeth unto thee but unto us confus
of face as at thi day; to the men of judah and to the inhabit
of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far
off through all the countri whither thou hast driven them becaus
of their trespass that they have trespass against thee

9:8 o lord to us belongeth confus of face to our king to our
princ and to our father becaus we have sin against thee

9:9 to the lord our god belong merci and forgiv though we
have rebel against him; 9:10 neither have we obey the voic of
the lord our god to walk in hi law which he set befor us by hi
servant the prophet

9:11 yea all israel have transgress thi law even by depart
that they might not obey thi voice; therefor the curs is pour upon
us and the oath that is written in the law of mose the servant of
god becaus we have sin against him

9:12 and he hath confirm hi word which he spake against us and
against our judg that judg us by bring upon us a great evil:
for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon
jerusalem

9:13 as it is written in the law of mose all thi evil is come upon
us: yet made we not our prayer befor the lord our god that we might
turn from our iniqu and understand thi truth

9:14 therefor hath the lord watch upon the evil and brought it
upon us: for the lord our god is righteou in all hi work which he
doeth: for we obey not hi voic

9:15 and now o lord our god that hast brought thi peopl forth out
of the land of egypt with a mighti hand and hast gotten thee renown
as at thi day; we have sin we have done wickedli

9:16 o lord accord to all thi righteous i beseech thee let
thine anger and thi furi be turn away from thi citi jerusalem thi
holi mountain: becaus for our sin and for the iniqu of our
father jerusalem and thi peopl are becom a reproach to all that
are about us

9:17 now therefor o our god hear the prayer of thi servant and hi
supplic and caus thi face to shine upon thi sanctuari that is
desol for the lord sake

9:18 o my god inclin thine ear and hear; open thine eye and
behold our desol and the citi which is call by thi name: for
we do not present our supplic befor thee for our
righteous but for thi great merci

9:19 o lord hear; o lord forgive; o lord hearken and do; defer not
for thine own sake o my god: for thi citi and thi peopl are call
by thi name

9:20 and while i wa speak and pray and confess my sin and
the sin of my peopl israel and present my supplic befor the
lord my god for the holi mountain of my god; 9:21 yea while i wa
speak in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the
vision at the begin be caus to fli swiftli touch me about
the time of the even oblat

9:22 and he inform me and talk with me and said o daniel i am
now come forth to give thee skill and understand

9:23 at the begin of thi supplic the command came forth
and i am come to shew thee; for thou art greatli beloved: therefor
understand the matter and consid the vision

9:24 seventi week are determin upon thi peopl and upon thi holi
citi to finish the transgress and to make an end of sin and to
make reconcili for iniqu and to bring in everlast
righteous and to seal up the vision and propheci and to anoint

command to restor and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the
princ shall be seven week and threescor and two weeks: the street
shall be built again and the wall even in troublou time

9:26 and after threescor and two week shall messiah be cut off but
not for himself: and the peopl of the princ that shall come shall
destroy the citi and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with
a flood and unto the end of the war desol are determin

9:27 and he shall confirm the coven with mani for one week: and in
the midst of the week he shall caus the sacrific and the oblat to
ceas and for the overspread of abomin he shall make it
desol even until the consumm and that determin shall be

10:1 in the third year of cyru king of persia a thing wa reveal
unto daniel whose name wa call belteshazzar; and the thing wa
true but the time appoint wa long: and he understood the thing
and had understand of the vision

10:2 in those day i daniel wa mourn three full week

10:3 i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth
neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole week were
fulfil

10:4 and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i wa by
the side of the great river which is hiddekel; 10:5 then i lift up
mine eye and look and behold a certain man cloth in linen
whose loin were gird with fine gold of uphaz: 10:6 hi bodi also
wa like the beryl and hi face as the appear of lightn and
hi eye as lamp of fire and hi arm and hi feet like in colour to
polish brass and the voic of hi word like the voic of a
multitud

10:7 and i daniel alon saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision; but a great quak fell upon them so that they
fled to hide themselv

10:8 therefor i wa left alon and saw thi great vision and there
remain no strength in me: for my comeli wa turn in me into
corrupt and i retain no strength

10:9 yet heard i the voic of hi words: and when i heard the voic of
hi word then wa i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward
the ground

10:10 and behold an hand touch me which set me upon my knee and

10:11 and he said unto me o daniel a man greatli belov understand
the word that i speak unto thee and stand upright: for unto thee am
i now sent

and when he had spoken thi word unto me i stood trembl

10:12 then said he unto me fear not daniel: for from the first day
that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself
befor thi god thi word were heard and i am come for thi word

10:13 but the princ of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and
twenti days: but lo michael one of the chief princ came to help
me; and i remain there with the king of persia

10:14 now i am come to make thee understand what shall befal thi
peopl in the latter days: for yet the vision is for mani day

10:15 and when he had spoken such word unto me i set my face toward
the ground and i becam dumb

10:16 and behold one like the similitud of the son of men touch
my lips: then i open my mouth and spake and said unto him that
stood befor me o my lord by the vision my sorrow are turn upon
me and i have retain no strength

10:17 for how can the servant of thi my lord talk with thi my lord?
for as for me straightway there remain no strength in me neither
is there breath left in me

10:18 then there came again and touch me one like the appear of
a man and he strengthen me 10:19 and said o man greatli belov
fear not: peac be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he
had spoken unto me i wa strengthen and said let my lord speak;
for thou hast strengthen me

10:20 then said he knowest thou wherefor i come unto thee? and now
will i return to fight with the princ of persia: and when i am gone
forth lo the princ of grecia shall come

10:21 but i will shew thee that which is note in the scriptur of
truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these thing but
michael your princ

11:1 also i in the first year of dariu the mede even i stood to
confirm and to strengthen him

11:2 and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up
yet three king in persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than
they all: and by hi strength through hi rich he shall stir up all
against the realm of grecia

11:3 and a mighti king shall stand up that shall rule with great
dominion and do accord to hi will

11:4 and when he shall stand up hi kingdom shall be broken and
shall be divid toward the four wind of heaven; and not to hi
poster nor accord to hi dominion which he ruled: for hi
kingdom shall be pluck up even for other besid those

11:5 and the king of the south shall be strong and one of hi
princes; and he shall be strong abov him and have dominion; hi
dominion shall be a great dominion

11:6 and in the end of year they shall join themselv together; for
the king daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north
to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm;
neither shall he stand nor hi arm: but she shall be given up and
they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthen
her in these time

11:7 but out of a branch of her root shall one stand up in hi
estat which shall come with an armi and shall enter into the
fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and
shall prevail: 11:8 and shall also carri captiv into egypt their
god with their princ and with their preciou vessel of silver
and of gold; and he shall continu more year than the king of the
north

11:9 so the king of the south shall come into hi kingdom and shall
return into hi own land

11:10 but hi son shall be stir up and shall assembl a multitud
of great forces: and one shall certainli come and overflow and pass
through: then shall he return and be stir up even to hi
fortress

11:11 and the king of the south shall be move with choler and shall
come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north: and he
shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitud shall be given
into hi hand

11:12 and when he hath taken away the multitud hi heart shall be
lift up; and he shall cast down mani ten thousands: but he shall not
be strengthen by it

11:13 for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a
multitud greater than the former and shall certainli come after
certain year with a great armi and with much rich

11:14 and in those time there shall mani stand up against the king of
the south: also the robber of thi peopl shall exalt themselv to
establish the vision; but they shall fall

11:15 so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and
take the most fenc cities: and the arm of the south shall not
withstand neither hi chosen peopl neither shall there be ani
strength to withstand

11:16 but he that cometh against him shall do accord to hi own
will and none shall stand befor him: and he shall stand in the
gloriou land which by hi hand shall be consum

11:17 he shall also set hi face to enter with the strength of hi
whole kingdom and upright one with him; thu shall he do: and he
shall give him the daughter of women corrupt her: but she shall
not stand on hi side neither be for him

11:18 after thi shall he turn hi face unto the isl and shall take
many: but a princ for hi own behalf shall caus the reproach offer
by him to cease; without hi own reproach he shall caus it to turn
upon him

11:19 then he shall turn hi face toward the fort of hi own land: but
he shall stumbl and fall and not be found

11:20 then shall stand up in hi estat a raiser of tax in the glori
of the kingdom: but within few day he shall be destroy neither in
anger nor in battl

11:21 and in hi estat shall stand up a vile person to whom they
shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
peaceabl and obtain the kingdom by flatteri

11:22 and with the arm of a flood shall they be overflown from befor
him and shall be broken; yea also the princ of the coven

11:23 and after the leagu made with him he shall work deceitfully:
for he shall come up and shall becom strong with a small peopl

11:24 he shall enter peaceabl even upon the fattest place of the
province; and he shall do that which hi father have not done nor
hi father fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil
and riches: yea and he shall forecast hi devic against the strong
hold even for a time

11:25 and he shall stir up hi power and hi courag against the king
of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be
stir up to battl with a veri great and mighti army; but he shall
not stand: for they shall forecast devic against him

11:26 yea they that feed of the portion of hi meat shall destroy
him and hi armi shall overflow: and mani shall fall down slain

11:27 and both of these king heart shall be to do mischief and
they shall speak lie at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet
the end shall be at the time appoint

11:28 then shall he return into hi land with great riches; and hi
heart shall be against the holi covenant; and he shall do exploit
and return to hi own land

11:29 at the time appoint he shall return and come toward the
south; but it shall not be as the former or as the latter

11:30 for the ship of chittim shall come against him: therefor he
shall be griev and return and have indign against the holi
covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return and have intellig
with them that forsak the holi coven

11:31 and arm shall stand on hi part and they shall pollut the
sanctuari of strength and shall take away the daili sacrific and
they shall place the abomin that maketh desol

11:32 and such as do wickedli against the coven shall he corrupt by
flatteries: but the peopl that do know their god shall be strong and
do exploit

11:33 and they that understand among the peopl shall instruct many:
yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captiv and by
spoil mani day

11:34 now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a littl
help: but mani shall cleav to them with flatteri

11:35 and some of them of understand shall fall to tri them and
to purg and to make them white even to the time of the end: becaus
it is yet for a time appoint

11:36 and the king shall do accord to hi will; and he shall exalt
himself and magnifi himself abov everi god and shall speak
marvel thing against the god of god and shall prosper till the
indign be accomplished: for that that is determin shall be
done

11:37 neither shall he regard the god of hi father nor the desir
of women nor regard ani god: for he shall magnifi himself abov all

11:38 but in hi estat shall he honour the god of forces: and a god
whom hi father knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and
with preciou stone and pleasant thing

11:39 thu shall he do in the most strong hold with a strang god
whom he shall acknowledg and increas with glory: and he shall caus
them to rule over mani and shall divid the land for gain

11:40 and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
whirlwind with chariot and with horsemen and with mani ships; and
he shall enter into the countri and shall overflow and pass over

11:41 he shall enter also into the gloriou land and mani countri
shall be overthrown: but these shall escap out of hi hand even
edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon

11:42 he shall stretch forth hi hand also upon the countries: and the
land of egypt shall not escap

11:43 but he shall have power over the treasur of gold and of
silver and over all the preciou thing of egypt: and the libyan and
the ethiopian shall be at hi step

11:44 but tide out of the east and out of the north shall troubl
him: therefor he shall go forth with great furi to destroy and
utterli to make away mani

11:45 and he shall plant the tabernacl of hi palac between the
sea in the gloriou holi mountain; yet he shall come to hi end and
none shall help him

12:1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great princ which
standeth for the children of thi people: and there shall be a time of
troubl such as never wa sinc there wa a nation even to that same
time: and at that time thi peopl shall be deliv everi one that
shall be found written in the book

12:2 and mani of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awak
some to everlast life and some to shame and everlast contempt

12:3 and they that be wise shall shine as the bright of the
firmament; and they that turn mani to righteous as the star for
ever and ever

12:4 but thou o daniel shut up the word and seal the book even to
the time of the end: mani shall run to and fro and knowledg shall be
increas

12:5 then i daniel look and behold there stood other two the one
on thi side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of
the bank of the river

12:6 and one said to the man cloth in linen which wa upon the
water of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
12:7 and i heard the man cloth in linen which wa upon the water
of the river when he held up hi right hand and hi left hand unto
heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a
time time and an half; and when he shall have accomplish to
scatter the power of the holi peopl all these thing shall be
finish

12:8 and i heard but i understood not: then said i o my lord what
shall be the end of these things? 12:9 and he said go thi way
daniel: for the word are close up and seal till the time of the
end

12:10 mani shall be purifi and made white and tried; but the
wick shall do wickedly: and none of the wick shall understand; but
the wise shall understand

12:11 and from the time that the daili sacrific shall be taken away
and the abomin that maketh desol set up there shall be a
thousand two hundr and nineti day

12:12 bless is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three
hundr and five and thirti day

12:13 but go thou thi way till the end be: for thou shalt rest
and stand in thi lot at the end of the day




hosea


1:1 the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in
the day of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah king of judah and in
the day of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel

1:2 the begin of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said
to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of
whoredoms: for the land hath commit great whoredom depart from
the lord

1:3 so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim; which
conceiv and bare him a son

1:4 and the lord said unto him call hi name jezreel; for yet a
littl while and i will aveng the blood of jezreel upon the hous of
jehu and will caus to ceas the kingdom of the hous of israel

1:5 and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow
of israel in the valley of jezreel

1:6 and she conceiv again and bare a daughter and god said unto
him call her name loruhamah: for i will no more have merci upon the
hous of israel; but i will utterli take them away

1:7 but i will have merci upon the hous of judah and will save them
by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword
nor by battl by hors nor by horsemen

1:8 now when she had wean loruhamah she conceiv and bare a son

1:9 then said god call hi name loammi: for ye are not my peopl and
i will not be your god

1:10 yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of
the sea which cannot be measur nor numbered; and it shall come to
pass that in the place where it wa said unto them ye are not my
peopl there it shall be said unto them ye are the son of the
live god

1:11 then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be
gather togeth and appoint themselv one head and they shall
come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of jezreel

2:1 say ye unto your brethren ammi; and to your sister ruhamah

2:2 plead with your mother plead: for she is not my wife neither am
i her husband: let her therefor put away her whoredom out of her
sight and her adulteri from between her breasts; 2:3 lest i strip
her nake and set her as in the day that she wa born and make her
as a wilder and set her like a dri land and slay her with
thirst

2:4 and i will not have merci upon her children; for they be the
children of whoredom

2:5 for their mother hath play the harlot: she that conceiv them
hath done shamefully: for she said i will go after my lover that
give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my
drink

2:6 therefor behold i will hedg up thi way with thorn and make a
wall that she shall not find her path

2:7 and she shall follow after her lover but she shall not overtak
them; and she shall seek them but shall not find them: then shall she
say i will go and return to my first husband; for then wa it better
with me than now

2:8 for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and
multipli her silver and gold which they prepar for baal

2:9 therefor will i return and take away my corn in the time
thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recov my wool
and my flax given to cover her naked

2:10 and now will i discov her lewd in the sight of her lover
and none shall deliv her out of mine hand

2:11 i will also caus all her mirth to ceas her feast day her new
moon and her sabbath and all her solemn feast

2:12 and i will destroy her vine and her fig tree whereof she hath
said these are my reward that my lover have given me: and i will
make them a forest and the beast of the field shall eat them

2:13 and i will visit upon her the day of baalim wherein she burn
incens to them and she deck herself with her ear and her
jewel and she went after her lover and forgat me saith the lord

2:14 therefor behold i will allur her and bring her into the
wilder and speak comfort unto her

2:15 and i will give her her vineyard from thenc and the valley of
achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there as in the day of
her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
egypt

2:16 and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call
me ishi; and shalt call me no more baali

2:17 for i will take away the name of baalim out of her mouth and
they shall no more be rememb by their name

2:18 and in that day will i make a coven for them with the beast
of the field and with the fowl of heaven and with the creep
thing of the ground: and i will break the bow and the sword and the
battl out of the earth and will make them to lie down safe

2:19 and i will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea i will betroth
thee unto me in righteous and in judgment and in lovingkind
and in merci

2:20 i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt
know the lord

2:21 and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the
lord i will hear the heaven and they shall hear the earth; 2:22 and
the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil; and they
shall hear jezreel

2:23 and i will sow her unto me in the earth; and i will have merci
upon her that had not obtain mercy; and i will say to them which
were not my peopl thou art my people; and they shall say thou art
my god

3:1 then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman belov of her
friend yet an adulteress accord to the love of the lord toward
the children of israel who look to other god and love flagon of
wine

3:2 so i bought her to me for fifteen piec of silver and for an
homer of barley and an half homer of barley: 3:3 and i said unto her
thou shalt abid for me mani days; thou shalt not play the harlot and
thou shalt not be for anoth man: so will i also be for thee

3:4 for the children of israel shall abid mani day without a king
and without a princ and without a sacrific and without an imag
and without an ephod and without teraphim: 3:5 afterward shall the
children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david
their king; and shall fear the lord and hi good in the latter
day

4:1 hear the word of the lord ye children of israel: for the lord
hath a controversi with the inhabit of the land becaus there is
no truth nor merci nor knowledg of god in the land

4:2 by swear and lie and kill and steal and commit
adulteri they break out and blood toucheth blood

4:3 therefor shall the land mourn and everi one that dwelleth
therein shall languish with the beast of the field and with the
fowl of heaven; yea the fish of the sea also shall be taken away

4:4 yet let no man strive nor reprov another: for thi peopl are as
they that strive with the priest

4:5 therefor shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall
fall with thee in the night and i will destroy thi mother

4:6 my peopl are destroy for lack of knowledge: becaus thou hast
reject knowledg i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no
priest to me: see thou hast forgotten the law of thi god i will
also forget thi children

4:7 as they were increas so they sin against me: therefor will
i chang their glori into shame

4:8 they eat up the sin of my peopl and they set their heart on
their iniqu

4:9 and there shall be like peopl like priest: and i will punish
them for their way and reward them their do

4:10 for they shall eat and not have enough: they shall commit
whoredom and shall not increase: becaus they have left off to take
heed to the lord

4:11 whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart

4:12 my peopl ask counsel at their stock and their staff declareth
unto them: for the spirit of whoredom hath caus them to err and
they have gone a whore from under their god

4:13 they sacrific upon the top of the mountain and burn incens
upon the hill under oak and poplar and elm becaus the shadow
thereof is good: therefor your daughter shall commit whoredom and
your spous shall commit adulteri

4:14 i will not punish your daughter when they commit whoredom nor
your spous when they commit adultery: for themselv are separ
with whore and they sacrific with harlots: therefor the peopl
that doth not understand shall fall

4:15 though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend;
and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear
the lord liveth

4:16 for israel slideth back as a backslid heifer: now the lord
will feed them as a lamb in a larg place

4:17 ephraim is join to idols: let him alon

4:18 their drink is sour: they have commit whoredom continually:
her ruler with shame do love give ye

4:19 the wind hath bound her up in her wing and they shall be
asham becaus of their sacrific

5:1 hear ye thi o priests; and hearken ye hous of israel; and give
ye ear o hous of the king; for judgment is toward you becaus ye
have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor

5:2 and the revolt are profound to make slaughter though i have
been a rebuk of them all

5:3 i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me: for now o ephraim
thou committest whoredom and israel is defil

5:4 they will not frame their do to turn unto their god: for the
spirit of whoredom is in the midst of them and they have not known
the lord

5:5 and the pride of israel doth testifi to hi face: therefor shall
israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity: judah also shall fall with
them

5:6 they shall go with their flock and with their herd to seek the
lord; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from
them

5:7 they have dealt treacher against the lord: for they have
begotten strang children: now shall a month devour them with their
portion

5:8 blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah: cri aloud
at bethaven after thee o benjamin

5:9 ephraim shall be desol in the day of rebuke: among the tribe
of israel have i made known that which shall sure be

5:10 the princ of judah were like them that remov the bound:
therefor i will pour out my wrath upon them like water

5:11 ephraim is oppress and broken in judgment becaus he willingli
walk after the command

5:12 therefor will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the hous of
judah as rotten

5:13 when ephraim saw hi sick and judah saw hi wound then went
ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb: yet could he not heal
you nor cure you of your wound

5:14 for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the
hous of judah: i even i will tear and go away; i will take away
and none shall rescu him

5:15 i will go and return to my place till they acknowledg their
offenc and seek my face: in their afflict they will seek me
earli

6:1 come and let us return unto the lord: for he hath torn and he
will heal us; he hath smitten and he will bind us up

6:2 after two day will he reviv us: in the third day he will rais
us up and we shall live in hi sight

6:3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord: hi go
forth is prepar as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the
rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth

6:4 o ephraim what shall i do unto thee? o judah what shall i do
unto thee? for your good is as a morn cloud and as the earli
dew it goeth away

6:5 therefor have i hew them by the prophets; i have slain them by
the word of my mouth: and thi judgment are as the light that goeth
forth

6:6 for i desir merci and not sacrifice; and the knowledg of god
more than burnt offer

6:7 but they like men have transgress the covenant: there have they
dealt treacher against me

6:8 gilead is a citi of them that work iniqu and is pollut with
blood

6:9 and as troop of robber wait for a man so the compani of priest
murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewd

6:10 i have seen an horribl thing in the hous of israel: there is
the whoredom of ephraim israel is defil

6:11 also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i return
the captiv of my peopl

7:1 when i would have heal israel then the iniqu of ephraim wa
discov and the wicked of samaria: for they commit falsehood;
and the thief cometh in and the troop of robber spoileth without

7:2 and they consid not in their heart that i rememb all their
wickedness: now their own do have beset them about; they are
befor my face

7:3 they make the king glad with their wicked and the princ
with their lie

7:4 they are all adulter as an oven heat by the baker who
ceaseth from rais after he hath knead the dough until it be
leaven

7:5 in the day of our king the princ have made him sick with bottl
of wine; he stretch out hi hand with scorner

7:6 for they have made readi their heart like an oven while they lie
in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morn it burneth
as a flame fire

7:7 they are all hot as an oven and have devour their judges; all
their king are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me

7:8 ephraim he hath mix himself among the people; ephraim is a cake
not turn

7:9 stranger have devour hi strength and he knoweth it not: yea
gray hair are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not

7:10 and the pride of israel testifieth to hi face: and they do not
return to the lord their god nor seek him for all thi

7:11 ephraim also is like a silli dove without heart: they call to
egypt they go to assyria

7:12 when they shall go i will spread my net upon them; i will bring
them down as the fowl of the heaven; i will chastis them as their
congreg hath heard

7:13 woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruct unto them!
becaus they have transgress against me: though i have redeem
them yet they have spoken lie against me

7:14 and they have not cri unto me with their heart when they
howl upon their beds: they assembl themselv for corn and wine
and they rebel against me

7:15 though i have bound and strengthen their arm yet do they
imagin mischief against me

7:16 they return but not to the most high: they are like a deceit
bow: their princ shall fall by the sword for the rage of their
tongue: thi shall be their deris in the land of egypt

8:1 set the trumpet to thi mouth he shall come as an eagl against
the hous of the lord becaus they have transgress my coven and
trespass against my law

8:2 israel shall cri unto me my god we know thee

8:3 israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemi shall
pursu him

8:4 they have set up king but not by me: they have made princ and
i knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them
idol that they may be cut off

8:5 thi calf o samaria hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindl
against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? 8:6
for from israel wa it also: the workman made it; therefor it is not
god: but the calf of samaria shall be broken in piec

8:7 for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind: it
hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield the
stranger shall swallow it up

8:8 israel is swallow up: now shall they be among the gentil as a
vessel wherein is no pleasur

8:9 for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alon by himself:
ephraim hath hire lover

8:10 yea though they have hire among the nation now will i gather
them and they shall sorrow a littl for the burden of the king of
princ

8:11 becaus ephraim hath made mani altar to sin altar shall be
unto him to sin

8:12 i have written to him the great thing of my law but they were
count as a strang thing

8:13 they sacrific flesh for the sacrific of mine offer and
eat it; but the lord accepteth them not; now will he rememb their
iniqu and visit their sins: they shall return to egypt

8:14 for israel hath forgotten hi maker and buildeth temples; and
judah hath multipli fenc cities: but i will send a fire upon hi
citi and it shall devour the palac thereof

9:1 rejoic not o israel for joy as other people: for thou hast
gone a whore from thi god thou hast love a reward upon everi
cornfloor

9:2 the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine
shall fail in her

9:3 they shall not dwell in the lord land; but ephraim shall return
to egypt and they shall eat unclean thing in assyria

9:4 they shall not offer wine offer to the lord neither shall
they be pleas unto him: their sacrific shall be unto them as the
bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their
bread for their soul shall not come into the hous of the lord

9:5 what will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of
the lord? 9:6 for lo they are gone becaus of destruction: egypt
shall gather them up memphi shall buri them: the pleasant place for
their silver nettl shall possess them: thorn shall be in their
tabernacl

9:7 the day of visit are come the day of recomp are come;
israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool the spiritu man is mad
for the multitud of thine iniqu and the great hatr

9:8 the watchman of ephraim wa with my god: but the prophet is a
snare of a fowler in all hi way and hatr in the hous of hi god

9:9 they have deepli corrupt themselv as in the day of gibeah:
therefor he will rememb their iniqu he will visit their sin

9:10 i found israel like grape in the wilderness; i saw your father
as the firstrip in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to
baalpeor and separ themselv unto that shame; and their
abomin were accord as they love

9:11 as for ephraim their glori shall fli away like a bird from the
birth and from the womb and from the concept

9:12 though they bring up their children yet will i bereav them
that there shall not be a man left: yea woe also to them when i
depart from them! 9:13 ephraim as i saw tyru is plant in a
pleasant place: but ephraim shall bring forth hi children to the
murder

9:14 give them o lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarri
womb and dri breast

9:15 all their wicked is in gilgal: for there i hate them: for
the wicked of their do i will drive them out of mine hous i
will love them no more: all their princ are revolt

9:16 ephraim is smitten their root is dri up they shall bear no
fruit: yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the belov
fruit of their womb

9:17 my god will cast them away becaus they did not hearken unto
him: and they shall be wander among the nation

10:1 israel is an empti vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
accord to the multitud of hi fruit he hath increas the altars;
accord to the good of hi land they have made goodli imag

10:2 their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall
break down their altar he shall spoil their imag

10:3 for now they shall say we have no king becaus we fear not
the lord; what then should a king do to us? 10:4 they have spoken
word swear fals in make a covenant: thu judgment springeth
up as hemlock in the furrow of the field

10:5 the inhabit of samaria shall fear becaus of the calv of
bethaven: for the peopl thereof shall mourn over it and the priest
thereof that rejoic on it for the glori thereof becaus it is
depart from it

10:6 it shall be also carri unto assyria for a present to king
jareb: ephraim shall receiv shame and israel shall be asham of hi
own counsel

10:7 as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water

10:8 the high place also of aven the sin of israel shall be
destroyed: the thorn and the thistl shall come up on their altars;
and they shall say to the mountain cover us; and to the hill fall
on us

10:9 o israel thou hast sin from the day of gibeah: there they
stood: the battl in gibeah against the children of iniqu did not
overtak them

10:10 it is in my desir that i should chastis them; and the peopl
shall be gather against them when they shall bind themselv in
their two furrow

10:11 and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread
out the corn; but i pass over upon her fair neck: i will make
ephraim to ride; judah shall plow and jacob shall break hi clod

10:12 sow to yourselv in righteous reap in mercy; break up your
fallow ground: for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain
righteous upon you

10:13 ye have plow wicked ye have reap iniquity; ye have
eaten the fruit of lies: becaus thou didst trust in thi way in the
multitud of thi mighti men

10:14 therefor shall a tumult aris among thi peopl and all thi
fortress shall be spoil as shalman spoil betharbel in the day
of battle: the mother wa dash in piec upon her children

10:15 so shall bethel do unto you becaus of your great wickedness: in
a morn shall the king of israel utterli be cut off

11:1 when israel wa a child then i love him and call my son out
of egypt

11:2 as they call them so they went from them: they sacrif unto
baalim and burn incens to graven imag

11:3 i taught ephraim also to go take them by their arms; but they
knew not that i heal them

11:4 i drew them with cord of a man with band of love: and i wa to
them as they that take off the yoke on their jaw and i laid meat
unto them

11:5 he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrian
shall be hi king becaus they refus to return

11:6 and the sword shall abid on hi citi and shall consum hi
branch and devour them becaus of their own counsel

11:7 and my peopl are bent to backslid from me: though they call
them to the most high none at all would exalt him

11:8 how shall i give thee up ephraim? how shall i deliv thee
israel? how shall i make thee as admah? how shall i set thee as
zeboim? mine heart is turn within me my repent are kindl
togeth

11:9 i will not execut the fierc of mine anger i will not
return to destroy ephraim: for i am god and not man; the holi one in
the midst of thee: and i will not enter into the citi

11:10 they shall walk after the lord: he shall roar like a lion: when
he shall roar then the children shall trembl from the west

11:11 they shall trembl as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of
the land of assyria: and i will place them in their hous saith the
lord

11:12 ephraim compasseth me about with lie and the hous of israel
with deceit: but judah yet ruleth with god and is faith with the
saint

12:1 ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind: he
daili increaseth lie and desolation; and they do make a coven with
the assyrian and oil is carri into egypt

12:2 the lord hath also a controversi with judah and will punish
jacob accord to hi ways; accord to hi do will he
recompens him

12:3 he took hi brother by the heel in the womb and by hi strength
he had power with god: 12:4 yea he had power over the angel and
prevailed: he wept and made supplic unto him: he found him in
bethel and there he spake with us; 12:5 even the lord god of hosts;
the lord is hi memori

12:6 therefor turn thou to thi god: keep merci and judgment and wait
on thi god continu

12:7 he is a merchant the balanc of deceit are in hi hand: he
loveth to oppress

12:8 and ephraim said yet i am becom rich i have found me out
substance: in all my labour they shall find none iniqu in me that
were sin

12:9 and i that am the lord thi god from the land of egypt will yet
make thee to dwell in tabernacl as in the day of the solemn feast

12:10 i have also spoken by the prophet and i have multipli
vision and use similitud by the ministri of the prophet

12:11 is there iniqu in gilead? sure they are vanity: they
sacrific bullock in gilgal; yea their altar are as heap in the
furrow of the field

12:12 and jacob fled into the countri of syria and israel serv for
a wife and for a wife he kept sheep

12:13 and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a
prophet wa he preserv

12:14 ephraim provok him to anger most bitterly: therefor shall he
leav hi blood upon him and hi reproach shall hi lord return unto
him

13:1 when ephraim spake trembl he exalt himself in israel; but
when he offend in baal he die

13:2 and now they sin more and more and have made them molten imag
of their silver and idol accord to their own understand all
of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them let the men that
sacrific kiss the calv

13:3 therefor they shall be as the morn cloud and as the earli dew
that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out
of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney

13:4 yet i am the lord thi god from the land of egypt and thou shalt
know no god but me: for there is no saviour besid me

13:5 i did know thee in the wilder in the land of great drought

13:6 accord to their pastur so were they filled; they were
fill and their heart wa exalted; therefor have they forgotten me

13:7 therefor i will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way
will i observ them: 13:8 i will meet them as a bear that is bereav
of her whelp and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i
devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them

13:9 o israel thou hast destroy thyself; but in me is thine help

13:10 i will be thi king: where is ani other that may save thee in all
thi cities? and thi judg of whom thou saidst give me a king and
princes? 13:11 i gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in
my wrath

13:12 the iniqu of ephraim is bound up; hi sin is hid

13:13 the sorrow of a travail woman shall come upon him: he is an
unwis son; for he should not stay long in the place of the break
forth of children

13:14 i will ransom them from the power of the grave; i will redeem
them from death: o death i will be thi plagues; o grave i will be
thi destruction: repent shall be hid from mine eye

13:15 though he be fruit among hi brethren an east wind shall
come the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilder and hi
spring shall becom dri and hi fountain shall be dri up: he shall
spoil the treasur of all pleasant vessel

13:16 samaria shall becom desolate; for she hath rebel against her
god: they shall fall by the sword: their infant shall be dash in
piec and their women with child shall be rip up

14:1 o israel return unto the lord thi god; for thou hast fallen by
thine iniqu

14:2 take with you word and turn to the lord: say unto him take
away all iniqu and receiv us graciously: so will we render the
calv of our lip

14:3 asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither
will we say ani more to the work of our hand ye are our gods: for in
thee the fatherless findeth merci

14:4 i will heal their backslid i will love them freely: for mine
anger is turn away from him

14:5 i will be as the dew unto israel: he shall grow as the lili and
cast forth hi root as lebanon

14:6 hi branch shall spread and hi beauti shall be as the oliv
tree and hi smell as lebanon

14:7 they that dwell under hi shadow shall return; they shall reviv
as the corn and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the
wine of lebanon

14:8 ephraim shall say what have i to do ani more with idols? i have
heard him and observ him: i am like a green fir tree from me is
thi fruit found

14:9 who is wise and he shall understand these things? prudent and
he shall know them? for the way of the lord are right and the just
shall walk in them: but the transgressor shall fall therein

of israel against the whole famili which i brought up from the land
of egypt say 3:2 you onli have i known of all the famili of the
earth: therefor i will punish you for all your iniqu

3:3 can two walk togeth except they be agreed? 3:4 will a lion
roar in the forest when he hath no prey? will a young lion cri out of

upon the earth where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare
from the earth and have taken noth at all? 3:6 shall a trumpet be
blown in the citi and the peopl not be afraid? shall there be evil

three month to the harvest: and i caus it to rain upon one citi
and caus it not to rain upon anoth city: one piec wa rain
upon and the piec whereupon it rain not wither

4:8 so two or three citi wander unto one citi to drink water; but
they were not satisfied: yet have ye not return unto me saith the

nostrils: yet have ye not return unto me saith the lord

4:11 i have overthrown some of you as god overthrew sodom and
gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand pluck out of the burning: yet

4:12 therefor thu will i do unto thee o israel: and becaus i will
do thi unto thee prepar to meet thi god o israel

4:13 for lo he that formeth the mountain and createth the wind
and declareth unto man what is hi thought that maketh the morn

forsaken upon her land; there is none to rais her up

5:3 for thu saith the lord god; the citi that went out by a thousand
shall leav an hundr and that which went forth by an hundr shall
leav ten to the hous of israel

5:4 for thu saith the lord unto the hous of israel seek ye me and
ye shall live: 5:5 but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal and
pass not to beersheba: for gilgal shall sure go into captiv and
bethel shall come to nought

5:6 seek the lord and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in
the hous of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in
bethel

5:7 ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leav off righteous in
the earth 5:8 seek him that maketh the seven star and orion and
turneth the shadow of death into the morn and maketh the day dark
with night: that calleth for the water of the sea and poureth them
out upon the face of the earth: the lord is hi name: 5:9 that
strengtheneth the spoil against the strong so that the spoil
shall come against the fortress

5:10 they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightli

5:11 forasmuch therefor as your tread is upon the poor and ye
take from him burden of wheat: ye have built hous of hewn stone
but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have plant pleasant vineyard
but ye shall not drink wine of them

5:12 for i know your manifold transgress and your mighti sins:
they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn asid the poor
in the gate from their right

5:13 therefor the prudent shall keep silenc in that time; for it is
an evil time

5:14 seek good and not evil that ye may live: and so the lord the
god of host shall be with you as ye have spoken

5:15 hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the
gate: it may be that the lord god of host will be graciou unto the
remnant of joseph

5:16 therefor the lord the god of host the lord saith thus;
wail shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the
highway alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourn
and such as are skil of lament to wail

5:17 and in all vineyard shall be wailing: for i will pass through
thee saith the lord

5:18 woe unto you that desir the day of the lord! to what end is it
for you? the day of the lord is dark and not light

5:19 as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him; or went
into the hous and lean hi hand on the wall and a serpent bit
him

5:20 shall not the day of the lord be dark and not light? even
veri dark and no bright in it? 5:21 i hate i despis your feast
day and i will not smell in your solemn assembl

5:22 though ye offer me burnt offer and your meat offer i
will not accept them: neither will i regard the peac offer of
your fat beast

5:23 take thou away from me the nois of thi songs; for i will not
hear the melodi of thi viol

5:24 but let judgment run down as water and righteous as a
mighti stream

5:25 have ye offer unto me sacrific and offer in the
wilder forti year o hous of israel? 5:26 but ye have born the
tabernacl of your moloch and chiun your imag the star of your god
which ye made to yourselv

5:27 therefor will i caus you to go into captiv beyond damascu
saith the lord whose name is the god of host

6:1 woe to them that are at eas in zion and trust in the mountain of
samaria which are name chief of the nation to whom the hous of
israel came! 6:2 pass ye unto calneh and see; and from thenc go ye
to hamath the great: then go down to gath of the philistines: be they
better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
6:3 ye that put far away the evil day and caus the seat of violenc
to come near; 6:4 that lie upon bed of ivori and stretch themselv
upon their couch and eat the lamb out of the flock and the calv
out of the midst of the stall; 6:5 that chant to the sound of the
viol and invent to themselv instrument of musick like david; 6:6
that drink wine in bowl and anoint themselv with the chief
ointments: but they are not griev for the afflict of joseph

6:7 therefor now shall they go captiv with the first that go
captiv and the banquet of them that stretch themselv shall be
remov

6:8 the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god of
host i abhor the excel of jacob and hate hi palaces:
therefor will i deliv up the citi with all that is therein

6:9 and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one hous
that they shall die

6:10 and a man uncl shall take him up and he that burneth him to
bring out the bone out of the hous and shall say unto him that is
by the side of the hous is there yet ani with thee? and he shall
say no then shall he say hold thi tongue: for we may not make
mention of the name of the lord

6:11 for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the great
hous with breach and the littl hous with cleft

6:12 shall hors run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?
for ye have turn judgment into gall and the fruit of righteous
into hemlock: 6:13 ye which rejoic in a thing of nought which say
have we not taken to us horn by our own strength? 6:14 but behold
i will rais up against you a nation o hous of israel saith the
lord the god of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the enter in
of hemath unto the river of the wilder

7:1 thu hath the lord god shew unto me; and behold he form
grasshopp in the begin of the shoot up of the latter growth;
and lo it wa the latter growth after the king mow

7:2 and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eat the
grass of the land then i said o lord god forgiv i beseech thee:
by whom shall jacob arise? for he is small

7:3 the lord repent for this: it shall not be saith the lord

7:4 thu hath the lord god shew unto me: and behold the lord god
call to contend by fire and it devour the great deep and did eat
up a part

7:5 then said i o lord god ceas i beseech thee: by whom shall
jacob arise? for he is small

7:6 the lord repent for this: thi also shall not be saith the lord
god

7:7 thu he shew me: and behold the lord stood upon a wall made by
a plumblin with a plumblin in hi hand

7:8 and the lord said unto me amo what seest thou? and i said a
plumblin then said the lord behold i will set a plumblin in the
midst of my peopl israel: i will not again pass by them ani more: 7:9
and the high place of isaac shall be desol and the sanctuari of
israel shall be laid waste; and i will rise against the hous of
jeroboam with the sword

7:10 then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of
israel say amo hath conspir against thee in the midst of the
hous of israel: the land is not abl to bear all hi word

7:11 for thu amo saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel
shall sure be led away captiv out of their own land

7:12 also amaziah said unto amo o thou seer go flee thee away into
the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesi there: 7:13 but
prophesi not again ani more at bethel: for it is the king chapel
and it is the king court

7:14 then answer amo and said to amaziah i wa no prophet
neither wa i a prophet son; but i wa an herdman and a gather of
sycomor fruit: 7:15 and the lord took me as i follow the flock and
the lord said unto me go prophesi unto my peopl israel

7:16 now therefor hear thou the word of the lord: thou sayest
prophesi not against israel and drop not thi word against the hous
of isaac

7:17 therefor thu saith the lord; thi wife shall be an harlot in the
citi and thi son and thi daughter shall fall by the sword and thi
land shall be divid by line; and thou shalt die in a pollut land:
and israel shall sure go into captiv forth of hi land

8:1 thu hath the lord god shew unto me: and behold a basket of
summer fruit

8:2 and he said amo what seest thou? and i said a basket of summer
fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my peopl of
israel; i will not again pass by them ani more

8:3 and the song of the templ shall be howl in that day saith
the lord god: there shall be mani dead bodi in everi place; they
shall cast them forth with silenc

8:4 hear thi o ye that swallow up the needi even to make the poor
of the land to fail 8:5 say when will the new moon be gone that
we may sell corn? and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat make
the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifi the balanc by
deceit? 8:6 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needi for a
pair of shoes; yea and sell the refus of the wheat? 8:7 the lord
hath sworn by the excel of jacob sure i will never forget ani
of their work

8:8 shall not the land trembl for thi and everi one mourn that
dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholli as a flood; and it shall
be cast out and drown as by the flood of egypt

8:9 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that i
will caus the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in
the clear day: 8:10 and i will turn your feast into mourn and all
your song into lamentation; and i will bring up sackcloth upon all
loin and bald upon everi head; and i will make it as the
mourn of an onli son and the end thereof as a bitter day

8:11 behold the day come saith the lord god that i will send a
famin in the land not a famin of bread nor a thirst for water but
of hear the word of the lord: 8:12 and they shall wander from sea
to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro
to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it

8:13 in that day shall the fair virgin and young men faint for
thirst

8:14 they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thi god o dan
liveth; and the manner of beersheba liveth; even they shall fall and
never rise up again

9:1 i saw the lord stand upon the altar: and he said smite the
lintel of the door that the post may shake: and cut them in the
head all of them; and i will slay the last of them with the sword: he
that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them
shall not be deliv

9:2 though they dig into hell thenc shall mine hand take them;
though they climb up to heaven thenc will i bring them down: 9:3 and
though they hide themselv in the top of carmel i will search and
take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the
bottom of the sea thenc will i command the serpent and he shall
bite them: 9:4 and though they go into captiv befor their enemi
thenc will i command the sword and it shall slay them: and i will
set mine eye upon them for evil and not for good

9:5 and the lord god of host is he that toucheth the land and it
shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise
up wholli like a flood; and shall be drown as by the flood of
egypt

9:6 it is he that buildeth hi stori in the heaven and hath found
hi troop in the earth; he that calleth for the water of the sea and
poureth them out upon the face of the earth: the lord is hi name

9:7 are ye not as children of the ethiopian unto me o children of
israel? saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land
of egypt? and the philistin from caphtor and the syrian from kir?
9:8 behold the eye of the lord god are upon the sin kingdom and
i will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that i will
not utterli destroy the hous of jacob saith the lord

9:9 for lo i will command and i will sift the hous of israel among
all nation like as corn is sift in a siev yet shall not the
least grain fall upon the earth

9:10 all the sinner of my peopl shall die by the sword which say
the evil shall not overtak nor prevent us

9:11 in that day will i rais up the tabernacl of david that is
fallen and close up the breach thereof; and i will rais up hi
ruin and i will build it as in the day of old: 9:12 that they may
possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are call
by my name saith the lord that doeth thi

9:13 behold the day come saith the lord that the plowman shall
overtak the reaper and the treader of grape him that soweth seed;
and the mountain shall drop sweet wine and all the hill shall melt

9:14 and i will bring again the captiv of my peopl of israel and
they shall build the wast citi and inhabit them; and they shall
plant vineyard and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make
garden and eat the fruit of them

9:15 and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be
pull up out of their land which i have given them saith the lord
thi god

thenc will i bring thee down saith the lord

1:5 if thiev came to thee if robber by night (how art thou cut

grapegather came to thee would they not leav some grapes? 1:6
how are the thing of esau search out! how are hi hidden thing
sought up! 1:7 all the men of thi confederaci have brought thee even
to the border: the men that were at peac with thee have deceiv
thee and prevail against thee; that they eat thi bread have laid a
wound under thee: there is none understand in him

1:8 shall i not in that day saith the lord even destroy the wise men

mighti men o teman shall be dismay to the end that everi one of
the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter

1:10 for thi violenc against thi brother jacob shame shall cover

1:11 in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that
the stranger carri away captiv hi forc and foreign enter
into hi gate and cast lot upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of
them

1:12 but thou shouldest not have look on the day of thi brother in
the day that he becam a stranger; neither shouldest thou have
rejoic over the children of judah in the day of their destruction;
neither shouldest thou have spoken proudli in the day of distress

1:13 thou shouldest not have enter into the gate of my peopl in the
day of their calamity; yea thou shouldest not have look on their
afflict in the day of their calam nor have laid hand on their
substanc in the day of their calamity; 1:14 neither shouldest thou
have stood in the crossway to cut off those of hi that did escape;
neither shouldest thou have deliv up those of hi that did remain
in the day of distress

1:15 for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou
hast done it shall be done unto thee: thi reward shall return upon
thine own head

1:16 for as ye have drunk upon my holi mountain so shall all the
heathen drink continu yea they shall drink and they shall

of jerusalem which is in sepharad shall possess the citi of the
south

1:21 and saviour shall come up on mount zion to judg the mount of

jonah


1:1 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai
say 1:2 aris go to nineveh that great citi and cri against it;
for their wicked is come up befor me

1:3 but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presenc of the
lord and went down to joppa; and he found a ship go to tarshish:
so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them
unto tarshish from the presenc of the lord

1:4 but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there wa a
mighti tempest in the sea so that the ship wa like to be broken

1:5 then the marin were afraid and cri everi man unto hi god
and cast forth the ware that were in the ship into the sea to
lighten it of them but jonah wa gone down into the side of the
ship; and he lay and wa fast asleep

1:6 so the shipmast came to him and said unto him what meanest
thou o sleeper? aris call upon thi god if so be that god will
think upon us that we perish not

1:7 and they said everi one to hi fellow come and let us cast lot
that we may know for whose caus thi evil is upon us so they cast
lot and the lot fell upon jonah

1:8 then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose caus
thi evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whenc comest
thou? what is thi country? and of what peopl art thou? 1:9 and he
said unto them i am an hebrew; and i fear the lord the god of
heaven which hath made the sea and the dri land

1:10 then were the men exceedingli afraid and said unto him whi hast
thou done this? for the men knew that he fled from the presenc of the
lord becaus he had told them

1:11 then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea
may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought and wa tempestu

1:12 and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the
sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for i know that for my sake
thi great tempest is upon you

1:13 nevertheless the men row hard to bring it to the land; but they
could not: for the sea wrought and wa tempestu against them

1:14 wherefor they cri unto the lord and said we beseech thee o
lord we beseech thee let us not perish for thi man life and lay
not upon us innoc blood: for thou o lord hast done as it pleas
thee

1:15 so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea: and the
sea ceas from her rage

1:16 then the men fear the lord exceedingli and offer a sacrific
unto the lord and made vow

1:17 now the lord had prepar a great fish to swallow up jonah and
jonah wa in the belli of the fish three day and three night

2:1 then jonah pray unto the lord hi god out of the fish belli
2:2 and said i cri by reason of mine afflict unto the lord and
he heard me; out of the belli of hell cri i and thou heardest my
voic

2:3 for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas;
and the flood compass me about: all thi billow and thi wave
pass over me

2:4 then i said i am cast out of thi sight; yet i will look again
toward thi holi templ

2:5 the water compass me about even to the soul: the depth close
me round about the weed were wrap about my head

2:6 i went down to the bottom of the mountains; the earth with her
bar wa about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from
corrupt o lord my god

2:7 when my soul faint within me i rememb the lord: and my
prayer came in unto thee into thine holi templ

2:8 they that observ lie vaniti forsak their own merci

2:9 but i will sacrific unto thee with the voic of thanksgiving; i
will pay that that i have vow salvat is of the lord

2:10 and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomit out jonah upon
the dri land

3:1 and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time say
3:2 aris go unto nineveh that great citi and preach unto it the
preach that i bid thee

3:3 so jonah aros and went unto nineveh accord to the word of
the lord now nineveh wa an exceed great citi of three day
journey

3:4 and jonah began to enter into the citi a day journey and he
cri and said yet forti day and nineveh shall be overthrown

3:5 so the peopl of nineveh believ god and proclaim a fast and
put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them

3:6 for word came unto the king of nineveh and he aros from hi
throne and he laid hi robe from him and cover him with sackcloth
and sat in ash

3:7 and he caus it to be proclaim and publish through nineveh by
the decre of the king and hi nobl say let neither man nor
beast herd nor flock tast ani thing: let them not feed nor drink
water: 3:8 but let man and beast be cover with sackcloth and cri
mightili unto god: yea let them turn everi one from hi evil way and
from the violenc that is in their hand

3:9 who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from hi
fierc anger that we perish not? 3:10 and god saw their work that
they turn from their evil way; and god repent of the evil that he
had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not

4:1 but it displeas jonah exceedingli and he wa veri angri

4:2 and he pray unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord wa
not thi my say when i wa yet in my country? therefor i fled
befor unto tarshish: for i knew that thou art a graciou god and
merci slow to anger and of great kind and repentest thee of
the evil

4:3 therefor now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me; for
it is better for me to die than to live

4:4 then said the lord doest thou well to be angry? 4:5 so jonah
went out of the citi and sat on the east side of the citi and there
made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see
what would becom of the citi

4:6 and the lord god prepar a gourd and made it to come up over
jonah that it might be a shadow over hi head to deliv him from
hi grief so jonah wa exceed glad of the gourd

4:7 but god prepar a worm when the morn rose the next day and it
smote the gourd that it wither

4:8 and it came to pass when the sun did aris that god prepar a
vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he
faint and wish in himself to die and said it is better for me
to die than to live

4:9 and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angri for the gourd?
and he said i do well to be angri even unto death

4:10 then said the lord thou hast had piti on the gourd for the
which thou hast not labour neither madest it grow; which came up in
a night and perish in a night: 4:11 and should not i spare nineveh
that great citi wherein are more then sixscor thousand person that
cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also
much cattle?




micah


1:1 the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthit in the
day of jotham ahaz and hezekiah king of judah which he saw
concern samaria and jerusalem

1:2 hear all ye people; hearken o earth and all that therein is:
and let the lord god be wit against you the lord from hi holi
templ

1:3 for behold the lord cometh forth out of hi place and will come
down and tread upon the high place of the earth

1:4 and the mountain shall be molten under him and the valley shall
be cleft as wax befor the fire and as the water that are pour
down a steep place

1:5 for the transgress of jacob is all thi and for the sin of
the hous of israel what is the transgress of jacob? is it not
samaria? and what are the high place of judah? are they not
jerusalem? 1:6 therefor i will make samaria as an heap of the field
and as plant of a vineyard: and i will pour down the stone
thereof into the valley and i will discov the foundat thereof

1:7 and all the graven imag thereof shall be beaten to piec and
all the hire thereof shall be burn with the fire and all the idol
thereof will i lay desolate: for she gather it of the hire of an
harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot

1:8 therefor i will wail and howl i will go strip and naked: i
will make a wail like the dragon and mourn as the owl

1:9 for her wound is incurable; for it is come unto judah; he is come
unto the gate of my peopl even to jerusalem

1:10 declar ye it not at gath weep ye not at all: in the hous of
aphrah roll thyself in the dust

1:11 pass ye away thou inhabit of saphir have thi shame naked:
the inhabit of zaanan came not forth in the mourn of bethezel;
he shall receiv of you hi stand

1:12 for the inhabit of maroth wait care for good: but evil
came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem

1:13 o thou inhabit of lachish bind the chariot to the swift
beast: she is the begin of the sin to the daughter of zion: for
the transgress of israel were found in thee

1:14 therefor shalt thou give present to moreshethgath: the hous
of achzib shall be a lie to the king of israel

1:15 yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabit of mareshah: he
shall come unto adullam the glori of israel

1:16 make thee bald and poll thee for thi delic children; enlarg
thi bald as the eagle; for they are gone into captiv from thee

2:1 woe to them that devis iniqu and work evil upon their beds!
when the morn is light they practis it becaus it is in the
power of their hand

2:2 and they covet field and take them by violence; and hous and
take them away: so they oppress a man and hi hous even a man and
hi heritag

2:3 therefor thu saith the lord; behold against thi famili do i
devis an evil from which ye shall not remov your necks; neither
shall ye go haughtily: for thi time is evil

2:4 in that day shall one take up a parabl against you and lament
with a dole lament and say we be utterli spoiled: he hath
chang the portion of my people: how hath he remov it from me!
turn away he hath divid our field

2:5 therefor thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in
the congreg of the lord

2:6 prophesi ye not say they to them that prophesy: they shall not
prophesi to them that they shall not take shame

2:7 o thou that art name the hous of jacob is the spirit of the
lord straitened? are these hi doings? do not my word do good to him
that walketh uprightly? 2:8 even of late my peopl is risen up as an
enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by
secur as men avers from war

2:9 the women of my peopl have ye cast out from their pleasant
houses; from their children have ye taken away my glori for ever

2:10 aris ye and depart; for thi is not your rest: becaus it is
pollut it shall destroy you even with a sore destruct

2:11 if a man walk in the spirit and falsehood do lie say i
will prophesi unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be
the prophet of thi peopl

2:12 i will sure assembl o jacob all of thee; i will sure
gather the remnant of israel; i will put them togeth as the sheep of
bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great
nois by reason of the multitud of men

2:13 the breaker is come up befor them: they have broken up and have
pass through the gate and are gone out by it: and their king shall
pass befor them and the lord on the head of them

3:1 and i said hear i pray you o head of jacob and ye princ of
the hous of israel; is it not for you to know judgment? 3:2 who hate
the good and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them
and their flesh from off their bones; 3:3 who also eat the flesh of my
peopl and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bone
and chop them in piec as for the pot and as flesh within the
caldron

3:4 then shall they cri unto the lord but he will not hear them: he
will even hide hi face from them at that time as they have behav
themselv ill in their do

3:5 thu saith the lord concern the prophet that make my peopl
err that bite with their teeth and cri peace; and he that putteth
not into their mouth they even prepar war against him

3:6 therefor night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a
vision; and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine; and
the sun shall go down over the prophet and the day shall be dark
over them

3:7 then shall the seer be asham and the divin confounded: yea
they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of god

3:8 but truli i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of
judgment and of might to declar unto jacob hi transgress and
to israel hi sin

3:9 hear thi i pray you ye head of the hous of jacob and princ
of the hous of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equiti

3:10 they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniqu

3:11 the head thereof judg for reward and the priest thereof teach
for hire and the prophet thereof divin for money: yet will they
lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us? none evil can
come upon us

3:12 therefor shall zion for your sake be plow as a field and
jerusalem shall becom heap and the mountain of the hous as the
high place of the forest

4:1 but in the last day it shall come to pass that the mountain of
the hous of the lord shall be establish in the top of the
mountain and it shall be exalt abov the hills; and peopl shall
flow unto it

4:2 and mani nation shall come and say come and let us go up to
the mountain of the lord and to the hous of the god of jacob; and he
will teach us of hi way and we will walk in hi paths: for the law
shall go forth of zion and the word of the lord from jerusalem

4:3 and he shall judg among mani peopl and rebuk strong nation
afar off; and they shall beat their sword into plowshar and their
spear into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against
nation neither shall they learn war ani more

4:4 but they shall sit everi man under hi vine and under hi fig
tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the lord of
host hath spoken it

4:5 for all peopl will walk everi one in the name of hi god and we
will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever

4:6 in that day saith the lord will i assembl her that halteth and
i will gather her that is driven out and her that i have afflicted;
4:7 and i will make her that halt a remnant and her that wa cast
far off a strong nation: and the lord shall reign over them in mount
zion from henceforth even for ever

4:8 and thou o tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of
zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion; the kingdom
shall come to the daughter of jerusalem

4:9 now whi dost thou cri out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thi
counsellor perished? for pang have taken thee as a woman in travail

4:10 be in pain and labour to bring forth o daughter of zion like a
woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the citi and
thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to babylon;
there shalt thou be delivered; there the lord shall redeem thee from
the hand of thine enemi

4:11 now also mani nation are gather against thee that say let
her be defil and let our eye look upon zion

4:12 but they know not the thought of the lord neither understand
they hi counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheav into the
floor

4:13 aris and thresh o daughter of zion: for i will make thine horn
iron and i will make thi hoof brass: and thou shalt beat in piec
mani people: and i will consecr their gain unto the lord and their
substanc unto the lord of the whole earth

5:1 now gather thyself in troop o daughter of troops: he hath laid
sieg against us: they shall smite the judg of israel with a rod upon
the cheek

5:2 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be littl among the
thousand of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that
is to be ruler in israel; whose go forth have been from of old
from everlast

5:3 therefor will he give them up until the time that she which
travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of hi brethren shall
return unto the children of israel

5:4 and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the
majesti of the name of the lord hi god; and they shall abide: for now
shall he be great unto the end of the earth

5:5 and thi man shall be the peac when the assyrian shall come into
our land: and when he shall tread in our palac then shall we rais
against him seven shepherd and eight princip men

5:6 and they shall wast the land of assyria with the sword and the
land of nimrod in the entranc thereof: thu shall he deliv us from
the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth
within our border

5:7 and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of mani peopl as a
dew from the lord as the shower upon the grass that tarrieth not
for man nor waiteth for the son of men

5:8 and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentil in the midst
of mani peopl as a lion among the beast of the forest as a young
lion among the flock of sheep: who if he go through both treadeth
down and teareth in piec and none can deliv

5:9 thine hand shall be lift up upon thine adversari and all
thine enemi shall be cut off

5:10 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i
will cut off thi hors out of the midst of thee and i will destroy
thi chariots: 5:11 and i will cut off the citi of thi land and
throw down all thi strong holds: 5:12 and i will cut off witchcraft
out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 5:13 thi
graven imag also will i cut off and thi stand imag out of the
midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hand

5:14 and i will pluck up thi grove out of the midst of thee: so will
i destroy thi citi

5:15 and i will execut vengeanc in anger and furi upon the heathen
such as they have not heard

6:1 hear ye now what the lord saith; aris contend thou befor the
mountain and let the hill hear thi voic

6:2 hear ye o mountain the lord controversi and ye strong
foundat of the earth: for the lord hath a controversi with hi
peopl and he will plead with israel

6:3 o my peopl what have i done unto thee? and wherein have i
weari thee? testifi against me

6:4 for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeem thee
out of the hous of servants; and i sent befor thee mose aaron and
miriam

6:5 o my peopl rememb now what balak king of moab consult and
what balaam the son of beor answer him from shittim unto gilgal;
that ye may know the righteous of the lord

6:6 wherewith shall i come befor the lord and bow myself befor the
high god? shall i come befor him with burnt offer with calv of
a year old? 6:7 will the lord be pleas with thousand of ram or
with ten thousand of river of oil? shall i give my firstborn for my
transgress the fruit of my bodi for the sin of my soul? 6:8 he
hath shew thee o man what is good; and what doth the lord requir
of thee but to do justli and to love merci and to walk humbl with
thi god? 6:9 the lord voic crieth unto the citi and the man of
wisdom shall see thi name: hear ye the rod and who hath appoint it

6:10 are there yet the treasur of wicked in the hous of the
wick and the scant measur that is abominable? 6:11 shall i count
them pure with the wick balanc and with the bag of deceit
weights? 6:12 for the rich men thereof are full of violenc and the
inhabit thereof have spoken lie and their tongu is deceit in
their mouth

6:13 therefor also will i make thee sick in smite thee in make
thee desol becaus of thi sin

6:14 thou shalt eat but not be satisfied; and thi cast down shall
be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold but shalt not
deliver; and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword

6:15 thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
oliv but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine but
shalt not drink wine

6:16 for the statut of omri are kept and all the work of the hous
of ahab and ye walk in their counsels; that i should make thee a
desol and the inhabit thereof an hissing: therefor ye shall
bear the reproach of my peopl

7:1 woe is me! for i am as when they have gather the summer fruit
as the grapeglean of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my
soul desir the firstrip fruit

7:2 the good man is perish out of the earth: and there is none
upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt everi man
hi brother with a net

7:3 that they may do evil with both hand earnestli the princ
asketh and the judg asketh for a reward; and the great man he
uttereth hi mischiev desire: so they wrap it up

7:4 the best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a
thorn hedge: the day of thi watchmen and thi visit cometh; now
shall be their perplex

7:5 trust ye not in a friend put ye not confid in a guide: keep
the door of thi mouth from her that lieth in thi bosom

7:6 for the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up
against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law; a
man enemi are the men of hi own hous

7:7 therefor i will look unto the lord; i will wait for the god of my
salvation: my god will hear me

7:8 rejoic not against me o mine enemy: when i fall i shall arise;
when i sit in dark the lord shall be a light unto me

7:9 i will bear the indign of the lord becaus i have sin
against him until he plead my caus and execut judgment for me: he
will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold hi
righteous

7:10 then she that is mine enemi shall see it and shame shall cover
her which said unto me where is the lord thi god? mine eye shall
behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the street

7:11 in the day that thi wall are to be built in that day shall the
decre be far remov

7:12 in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria and
from the fortifi citi and from the fortress even to the river
and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain

7:13 notwithstand the land shall be desol becaus of them that
dwell therein for the fruit of their do

7:14 feed thi peopl with thi rod the flock of thine heritag which
dwell solitarili in the wood in the midst of carmel: let them feed in
bashan and gilead as in the day of old

7:15 accord to the day of thi come out of the land of egypt will
i shew unto him marvel thing

7:16 the nation shall see and be confound at all their might: they
shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ear shall be deaf

7:17 they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of
their hole like worm of the earth: they shall be afraid of the lord
our god and shall fear becaus of thee

7:18 who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniqu and passeth
by the transgress of the remnant of hi heritage? he retaineth not
hi anger for ever becaus he delighteth in merci

7:19 he will turn again he will have compass upon us; he will
subdu our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sin into the
depth of the sea

7:20 thou wilt perform the truth to jacob and the merci to abraham
which thou hast sworn unto our father from the day of old

1:8 but with an overrun flood he will make an utter end of the
place thereof and dark shall pursu hi enemi

1:9 what do ye imagin against the lord? he will make an utter end:

2:2 for the lord hath turn away the excel of jacob as the
excel of israel: for the emptier have empti them out and

2:3 the shield of hi mighti men is made red the valiant men are in
scarlet: the chariot shall be with flame torch in the day of hi

2:4 the chariot shall rage in the street they shall justl one

2:6 the gate of the river shall be open and the palac shall be
dissolv

2:7 and huzzab shall be led away captiv she shall be brought up and
her maid shall lead her as with the voic of dove taber upon
their breast

2:8 but nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee
away

stand stand shall they cry; but none shall look back

2:9 take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold: for there is
none end of the store and glori out of all the pleasant furnitur

2:10 she is empti and void and waste: and the heart melteth and the
knee smite togeth and much pain is in all loin and the face of
them all gather black

2:11 where is the dwell of the lion and the feedingplac of the
young lion where the lion even the old lion walk and the lion

2:13 behold i am against thee saith the lord of host and i will
burn her chariot in the smoke and the sword shall devour thi young
lions: and i will cut off thi prey from the earth and the voic of
thi messeng shall no more be heard

3:1 woe to the bloodi city! it is all full of lie and robbery; the
prey departeth not; 3:2 the nois of a whip and the nois of the
rattl of the wheel and of the prans hors and of the jump
chariot

3:3 the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glitter
spear: and there is a multitud of slain and a great number of
carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumbl upon
their corpses: 3:4 becaus of the multitud of the whoredom of the
wellfavour harlot the mistress of witchcraft that selleth nation

whenc shall i seek comfort for thee? 3:8 art thou better than
popul no that wa situat among the river that had the water

put and lubim were thi helper

3:10 yet wa she carri away she went into captivity: her young
children also were dash in piec at the top of all the streets: and

gathereth them

3:19 there is no heal of thi bruise; thi wound is grievous: all

whom hath not thi wicked pass continually?




habakkuk


1:1 the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see

1:2 o lord how long shall i cri and thou wilt not hear! even cri out
unto thee of violenc and thou wilt not save! 1:3 whi dost thou shew
me iniqu and caus me to behold grievance? for spoil and
violenc are befor me: and there are that rais up strife and
content

1:4 therefor the law is slack and judgment doth never go forth:
for the wick doth compass about the righteous; therefor wrong
judgment proceedeth

1:5 behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvelously:
for i will work a work in your day which ye will not believ though
it be told you

1:6 for lo i rais up the chaldean that bitter and hasti nation
which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the
dwellingplac that are not their

1:7 they are terribl and dreadful: their judgment and their digniti
shall proceed of themselv

1:8 their hors also are swifter than the leopard and are more
fierc than the even wolves: and their horsemen shall spread
themselv and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fli as
the eagl that hasteth to eat

1:9 they shall come all for violence: their face shall sup up as the
east wind and they shall gather the captiv as the sand

1:10 and they shall scoff at the king and the princ shall be a
scorn unto them: they shall derid everi strong hold; for they shall
heap dust and take it

1:11 then shall hi mind chang and he shall pass over and offend
imput thi hi power unto hi god

1:12 art thou not from everlast o lord my god mine holi one? we
shall not die o lord thou hast ordain them for judgment; and o
mighti god thou hast establish them for correct

1:13 thou art of purer eye than to behold evil and canst not look on
iniquity: wherefor lookest thou upon them that deal treacher
and holdest thi tongu when the wick devoureth the man that is more
righteou than he? 1:14 and makest men as the fish of the sea as
the creep thing that have no ruler over them? 1:15 they take up
all of them with the angl they catch them in their net and gather
them in their drag: therefor they rejoic and are glad

1:16 therefor they sacrific unto their net and burn incens unto
their drag; becaus by them their portion is fat and their meat
plenteou

1:17 shall they therefor empti their net and not spare continu
to slay the nations? 2:1 i will stand upon my watch and set me upon
the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i
shall answer when i am reprov

2:2 and the lord answer me and said write the vision and make it
plain upon tabl that he may run that readeth it

2:3 for the vision is yet for an appoint time but at the end it
shall speak and not lie: though it tarri wait for it; becaus it
will sure come it will not tarri

2:4 behold hi soul which is lift up is not upright in him: but the
just shall live by hi faith

2:5 yea also becaus he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man
neither keepeth at home who enlargeth hi desir as hell and is as
death and cannot be satisfi but gathereth unto him all nation
and heapeth unto him all people: 2:6 shall not all these take up a
parabl against him and a taunt proverb against him and say woe
to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him
that ladeth himself with thick clay! 2:7 shall they not rise up
suddenli that shall bite thee and awak that shall vex thee and thou
shalt be for booti unto them? 2:8 becaus thou hast spoil mani
nation all the remnant of the peopl shall spoil thee; becaus of
men blood and for the violenc of the land of the citi and of all
that dwell therein

2:9 woe to him that coveteth an evil covet to hi hous that
he may set hi nest on high that he may be deliv from the power
of evil! 2:10 thou hast consult shame to thi hous by cut off
mani peopl and hast sin against thi soul

2:11 for the stone shall cri out of the wall and the beam out of the
timber shall answer it

2:12 woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a
citi by iniquity! 2:13 behold is it not of the lord of host that
the peopl shall labour in the veri fire and the peopl shall weari
themselv for veri vanity? 2:14 for the earth shall be fill with
the knowledg of the glori of the lord as the water cover the sea

2:15 woe unto him that giveth hi neighbour drink that puttest thi
bottl to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on
their nakedness! 2:16 thou art fill with shame for glory: drink
thou also and let thi foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the lord
right hand shall be turn unto thee and shame spew shall be on
thi glori

2:17 for the violenc of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of
beast which made them afraid becaus of men blood and for the
violenc of the land of the citi and of all that dwell therein

2:18 what profiteth the graven imag that the maker thereof hath
graven it; the molten imag and a teacher of lie that the maker of
hi work trusteth therein to make dumb idols? 2:19 woe unto him that
saith to the wood awake; to the dumb stone aris it shall teach!
behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath
at all in the midst of it

2:20 but the lord is in hi holi temple: let all the earth keep
silenc befor him

3:1 a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth

3:2 o lord i have heard thi speech and wa afraid: o lord reviv
thi work in the midst of the year in the midst of the year make
known; in wrath rememb merci

3:3 god came from teman and the holi one from mount paran selah hi
glori cover the heaven and the earth wa full of hi prais

3:4 and hi bright wa as the light; he had horn come out of
hi hand: and there wa the hide of hi power

3:5 befor him went the pestil and burn coal went forth at
hi feet

3:6 he stood and measur the earth: he beheld and drove asund the
nations; and the everlast mountain were scatter the perpetu
hill did bow: hi way are everlast

3:7 i saw the tent of cushan in affliction: and the curtain of the
land of midian did trembl

3:8 wa the lord displeas against the rivers? wa thine anger
against the rivers? wa thi wrath against the sea that thou didst
ride upon thine hors and thi chariot of salvation? 3:9 thi bow wa
made quit nake accord to the oath of the tribe even thi word
selah thou didst cleav the earth with river

3:10 the mountain saw thee and they trembled: the overflow of the
water pass by: the deep utter hi voic and lift up hi hand
on high

3:11 the sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of
thine arrow they went and at the shine of thi glitter spear

3:12 thou didst march through the land in indign thou didst
thresh the heathen in anger

3:13 thou wentest forth for the salvat of thi peopl even for
salvat with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the
hous of the wick by discov the foundat unto the neck
selah

3:14 thou didst strike through with hi stave the head of hi
villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoic
wa as to devour the poor secretli

3:15 thou didst walk through the sea with thine hors through the
heap of great water

3:16 when i heard my belli trembled; my lip quiver at the voice:
rotten enter into my bone and i trembl in myself that i
might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the peopl
he will invad them with hi troop

3:17 although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be
in the vines; the labour of the oliv shall fail and the field shall
yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there
shall be no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet i will rejoic in the lord i
will joy in the god of my salvat

3:19 the lord god is my strength and he will make my feet like hind
feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high place to the chief
singer on my string instrument

1:1 the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi

them that are turn back from the lord; and those that have not
sought the lord nor enquir for him

1:7 hold thi peac at the presenc of the lord god: for the day of the

hi guest

1:8 and it shall come to pass in the day of the lord sacrific that
i will punish the princ and the king children and all such as
are cloth with strang apparel

1:9 in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the
threshold which fill their master hous with violenc and deceit

1:10 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that there
shall be the nois of a cri from the fish gate and an howl from
the second and a great crash from the hill

1:11 howl ye inhabit of maktesh for all the merchant peopl are
cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off

1:12 and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search
jerusalem with candl and punish the men that are settl on their
lees: that say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will
he do evil

1:13 therefor their good shall becom a booti and their hous a
desolation: they shall also build hous but not inhabit them; and
they shall plant vineyard but not drink the wine thereof

1:14 the great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth
greatli even the voic of the day of the lord: the mighti man shall
cri there bitterli

1:15 that day is a day of wrath a day of troubl and distress a day
of wast and desol a day of dark and gloomi a day
of cloud and thick dark 1:16 a day of the trumpet and alarm
against the fenc citi and against the high tower

1:17 and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like
blind men becaus they have sin against the lord: and their blood
shall be pour out as dust and their flesh as the dung

1:18 neither their silver nor their gold shall be abl to deliv them
in the day of the lord wrath; but the whole land shall be devour
by the fire of hi jealousy: for he shall make even a speedi riddanc
of all them that dwell in the land

2:1 gather yourselv togeth yea gather togeth o nation not
desired; 2:2 befor the decre bring forth befor the day pass as the
chaff befor the fierc anger of the lord come upon you befor the
day of the lord anger come upon you

2:3 seek ye the lord all ye meek of the earth which have wrought hi
judgment; seek righteous seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid

2:5 woe unto the inhabit of the sea coast the nation of the
cherethites! the word of the lord is against you; o canaan the land
of the philistin i will even destroy thee that there shall be no
inhabit

2:6 and the sea coast shall be dwell and cottag for shepherd
and fold for flock

2:7 and the coast shall be for the remnant of the hous of judah; they
shall feed thereupon: in the hous of ashkelon shall they lie down in
the evening: for the lord their god shall visit them and turn away
their captiv

2:8 i have heard the reproach of moab and the revil of the
children of ammon wherebi they have reproach my peopl and
magnifi themselv against their border

2:9 therefor as i live saith the lord of host the god of israel
sure moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah
even the breed of nettl and saltpit and a perpetu
desolation: the residu of my peopl shall spoil them and the remnant
of my peopl shall possess them

2:10 thi shall they have for their pride becaus they have
reproach and magnifi themselv against the peopl of the lord of
host

2:11 the lord will be terribl unto them: for he will famish all the
god of the earth; and men shall worship him everi one from hi
place even all the isl of the heathen

2:12 ye ethiopian also ye shall be slain by my sword

2:13 and he will stretch out hi hand against the north and destroy
assyria; and will make nineveh a desol and dri like a
wilder

2:14 and flock shall lie down in the midst of her all the beast of
the nations: both the cormor and the bittern shall lodg in the
upper lintel of it; their voic shall sing in the windows; desol
shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncov the cedar work

2:15 thi is the rejoic citi that dwelt carelessli that said in
her heart i am and there is none besid me: how is she becom a
desol a place for beast to lie down in! everi one that passeth
by her shall hiss and wag hi hand

3:1 woe to her that is filthi and pollut to the oppress city!
3:2 she obey not the voice; she receiv not correction; she trust
not in the lord; she drew not near to her god

3:3 her princ within her are roar lions; her judg are even
wolves; they gnaw not the bone till the morrow

3:4 her prophet are light and treacher persons: her priest have
pollut the sanctuari they have done violenc to the law

3:5 the just lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity:
everi morn doth he bring hi judgment to light he faileth not; but
the unjust knoweth no shame

3:6 i have cut off the nations: their tower are desolate; i made
their street wast that none passeth by: their citi are destroy
so that there is no man that there is none inhabit

3:7 i said sure thou wilt fear me thou wilt receiv instruction;
so their dwell should not be cut off howsoev i punish them:
but they rose earli and corrupt all their do

3:8 therefor wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i
rise up to the prey: for my determin is to gather the nation
that i may assembl the kingdom to pour upon them mine indign
even all my fierc anger: for all the earth shall be devour with the
fire of my jealousi

3:9 for then will i turn to the peopl a pure languag that they may
all call upon the name of the lord to serv him with one consent

3:10 from beyond the river of ethiopia my suppliant even the
daughter of my dispers shall bring mine offer

3:11 in that day shalt thou not be asham for all thi do wherein
thou hast transgress against me: for then i will take away out of
the midst of thee them that rejoic in thi pride and thou shalt no
more be haughti becaus of my holi mountain

3:12 i will also leav in the midst of thee an afflict and poor
peopl and they shall trust in the name of the lord

3:13 the remnant of israel shall not do iniqu nor speak lies;
neither shall a deceit tongu be found in their mouth: for they
shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid

3:14 sing o daughter of zion; shout o israel; be glad and rejoic
with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem

3:15 the lord hath taken away thi judgment he hath cast out thine
enemy: the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee:
thou shalt not see evil ani more

3:16 in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not: and to
zion let not thine hand be slack

3:17 the lord thi god in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save he
will rejoic over thee with joy; he will rest in hi love he will joy
over thee with sing

3:18 i will gather them that are sorrow for the solemn assembl
who are of thee to whom the reproach of it wa a burden

3:19 behold at that time i will undo all that afflict thee: and i
will save her that halteth and gather her that wa driven out; and i
will get them prais and fame in everi land where they have been put
to shame

3:20 at that time will i bring you again even in the time that i
gather you: for i will make you a name and a prais among all peopl
of the earth when i turn back your captiv befor your eye
saith the lord

sherez and regemmelech and their men to pray befor the lord 7:3
and to speak unto the priest which were in the hous of the lord of
host and to the prophet say should i weep in the fifth month
separ myself as i have done these so mani years? 7:4 then came
the word of the lord of host unto me say 7:5 speak unto all the
peopl of the land and to the priest say when ye fast and
mourn in the fifth and seventh month even those seventi year did
ye at all fast unto me even to me? 7:6 and when ye did eat and when

7:7 should ye not hear the word which the lord hath cri by the
former prophet when jerusalem wa inhabit and in prosper and
the citi thereof round about her when men inhabit the south and

7:9 thu speaketh the lord of host say execut true judgment
and shew merci and compass everi man to hi brother: 7:10 and
oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor;
and let none of you imagin evil against hi brother in your heart

7:11 but they refus to hearken and pull away the shoulder and
stop their ear that they should not hear

7:12 yea they made their heart as an adam stone lest they should
hear the law and the word which the lord of host hath sent in hi

becaus of the affliction: for i set all men everi one against hi
neighbour

8:11 but now i will not be unto the residu of thi peopl as in the
former day saith the lord of host

8:12 for the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit
and the ground shall give her increas and the heaven shall give

8:13 and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curs among the
heathen o hous of judah and hous of israel; so will i save you

8:20 thu saith the lord of hosts; it shall yet come to pass that
there shall come peopl and the inhabit of mani cities: 8:21 and

8:22 yea mani peopl and strong nation shall come to seek the lord

pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languag of the
nation even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew
say we will go with you: for we have heard that god is with you

9:1 the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and
damascu shall be the rest thereof: when the eye of man as of all
the tribe of israel shall be toward the lord

9:2 and hamath also shall border thereby; tyru and zidon though it
be veri wise

9:3 and tyru did build herself a strong hold and heap up silver as
the dust and fine gold as the mire of the street

9:4 behold the lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in
the sea; and she shall be devour with fire

9:5 ashkelon shall see it and fear; gaza also shall see it and be
veri sorrow and ekron; for her expect shall be ashamed; and
the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabit

9:6 and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride

abomin from between hi teeth: but he that remaineth even he

him that passeth by and becaus of him that returneth: and no
oppressor shall pass through them ani more: for now have i seen with
mine eye

9:9 rejoic greatli o daughter of zion; shout o daughter of
jerusalem: behold thi king cometh unto thee: he is just and have
salvation; lowli and ride upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of
an ass

9:10 and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the hors from
jerusalem and the battl bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak
peac unto the heathen: and hi dominion shall be from sea even to
sea and from the river even to the end of the earth

9:11 as for thee also by the blood of thi coven i have sent forth
thi prison out of the pit wherein is no water

9:12 turn you to the strong hold ye prison of hope: even to day do
i declar that i will render doubl unto thee; 9:13 when i have bent
judah for me fill the bow with ephraim and rais up thi son o
zion against thi son o greec and made thee as the sword of a
mighti man

9:14 and the lord shall be seen over them and hi arrow shall go
forth as the lightning: and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and
shall go with whirlwind of the south

9:15 the lord of host shall defend them; and they shall devour and
subdu with sling stones; and they shall drink and make a nois as
through wine; and they shall be fill like bowl and as the corner
of the altar

9:16 and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock
of hi people: for they shall be as the stone of a crown lift up
as an ensign upon hi land

9:17 for how great is hi good and how great is hi beauty! corn
shall make the young men cheer and new wine the maid

10:1 ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
lord shall make bright cloud and give them shower of rain to everi
one grass in the field

10:2 for the idol have spoken vaniti and the divin have seen a
lie and have told fals dreams; they comfort in vain: therefor they
went their way as a flock they were troubl becaus there wa no
shepherd

10:3 mine anger wa kindl against the shepherd and i punish the
goats: for the lord of host hath visit hi flock the hous of
judah and hath made them as hi goodli hors in the battl

10:4 out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him
the battl bow out of him everi oppressor togeth

10:5 and they shall be as mighti men which tread down their enemi
in the mire of the street in the battle: and they shall fight
becaus the lord is with them and the rider on hors shall be
confound

10:6 and i will strengthen the hous of judah and i will save the
hous of joseph and i will bring them again to place them; for i have
merci upon them: and they shall be as though i had not cast them off:
for i am the lord their god and will hear them

10:7 and they of ephraim shall be like a mighti man and their heart
shall rejoic as through wine: yea their children shall see it and
be glad; their heart shall rejoic in the lord

10:8 i will hiss for them and gather them; for i have redeem them:
and they shall increas as they have increas

10:9 and i will sow them among the people: and they shall rememb me
in far countries; and they shall live with their children and turn
again

10:10 i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and
gather them out of assyria; and i will bring them into the land of
gilead and lebanon; and place shall not be found for them

10:11 and he shall pass through the sea with afflict and shall
smite the wave in the sea and all the deep of the river shall dri
up: and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptr of
egypt shall depart away

10:12 and i will strengthen them in the lord; and they shall walk up
and down in hi name saith the lord

11:1 open thi door o lebanon that the fire may devour thi cedar

11:2 howl fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; becaus the mighti are
spoiled: howl o ye oak of bashan; for the forest of the vintag is
come down

11:3 there is a voic of the howl of the shepherds; for their glori
is spoiled: a voic of the roar of young lions; for the pride of
jordan is spoil

11:4 thu saith the lord my god; feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5
whose possessor slay them and hold themselv not guilty: and they
that sell them say bless be the lord; for i am rich: and their own
shepherd piti them not

11:6 for i will no more piti the inhabit of the land saith the
lord: but lo i will deliv the men everi one into hi neighbour
hand and into the hand of hi king: and they shall smite the land
and out of their hand i will not deliv them

11:7 and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the
flock and i took unto me two staves; the one i call beauti and the
other i call bands; and i fed the flock

11:8 three shepherd also i cut off in one month; and my soul loth
them and their soul also abhor me

11:9 then said i i will not feed you: that that dieth let it die;
and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off; and let the rest
eat everi one the flesh of anoth

11:10 and i took my staff even beauti and cut it asund that i
might break my coven which i had made with all the peopl

11:11 and it wa broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that
wait upon me knew that it wa the word of the lord

11:12 and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price; and if
not forbear so they weigh for my price thirti piec of silver

11:13 and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter: a goodli
price that i wa prise at of them and i took the thirti piec of
silver and cast them to the potter in the hous of the lord

11:14 then i cut asund mine other staff even band that i might
break the brotherhood between judah and israel

11:15 and the lord said unto me take unto thee yet the instrument of
a foolish shepherd

11:16 for lo i will rais up a shepherd in the land which shall not
visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor
heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still: but he
shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claw in piec

11:17 woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall
be upon hi arm and upon hi right eye: hi arm shall be clean dri
up and hi right eye shall be utterli darken

12:1 the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord
which stretcheth forth the heaven and layeth the foundat of the
earth and formeth the spirit of man within him

12:2 behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembl unto all the
peopl round about when they shall be in the sieg both against judah
and against jerusalem

12:3 and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensom stone for all
people: all that burden themselv with it shall be cut in piec
though all the peopl of the earth be gather togeth against it

12:4 in that day saith the lord i will smite everi hors with
astonish and hi rider with madness: and i will open mine eye
upon the hous of judah and will smite everi hors of the peopl with
blind

12:5 and the governor of judah shall say in their heart the
inhabit of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of host
their god

12:6 in that day will i make the governor of judah like an hearth of
fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they
shall devour all the peopl round about on the right hand and on the
left: and jerusalem shall be inhabit again in her own place even in
jerusalem

12:7 the lord also shall save the tent of judah first that the glori
of the hous of david and the glori of the inhabit of jerusalem do
not magnifi themselv against judah

12:8 in that day shall the lord defend the inhabit of jerusalem;
and he that is feebl among them at that day shall be as david; and
the hous of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord befor
them

12:9 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to
destroy all the nation that come against jerusalem

12:10 and i will pour upon the hous of david and upon the
inhabit of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications:
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierc and they shall
mourn for him as one mourneth for hi onli son and shall be in
bitter for him as one that is in bitter for hi firstborn

12:11 in that day shall there be a great mourn in jerusalem as the
mourn of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon

12:12 and the land shall mourn everi famili apart; the famili of the
hous of david apart and their wive apart; the famili of the hous
of nathan apart and their wive apart; 12:13 the famili of the hous
of levi apart and their wive apart; the famili of shimei apart and
their wive apart; 12:14 all the famili that remain everi famili
apart and their wive apart

13:1 in that day there shall be a fountain open to the hous of
david and to the inhabit of jerusalem for sin and for unclean

13:2 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of host
that i will cut off the name of the idol out of the land and they
shall no more be remembered: and also i will caus the prophet and
the unclean spirit to pass out of the land

13:3 and it shall come to pass that when ani shall yet prophesi then
hi father and hi mother that begat him shall say unto him thou
shalt not live; for thou speakest lie in the name of the lord: and
hi father and hi mother that begat him shall thrust him through when
he prophesieth

13:4 and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophet shall be
asham everi one of hi vision when he hath prophesied; neither
shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 13:5 but he shall say i
am no prophet i am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattl
from my youth

13:6 and one shall say unto him what are these wound in thine hands?
then he shall answer those with which i wa wound in the hous of
my friend

13:7 awak o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is
my fellow saith the lord of hosts: smite the shepherd and the sheep
shall be scattered: and i will turn mine hand upon the littl one

13:8 and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord
two part therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be
left therein

13:9 and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refin
them as silver is refin and will tri them as gold is tried: they
shall call on my name and i will hear them: i will say it is my
people: and they shall say the lord is my god

14:1 behold the day of the lord cometh and thi spoil shall be
divid in the midst of thee

14:2 for i will gather all nation against jerusalem to battle; and
the citi shall be taken and the hous rifl and the women
ravished; and half of the citi shall go forth into captiv and the
residu of the peopl shall not be cut off from the citi

14:3 then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nation as
when he fought in the day of battl

14:4 and hi feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of oliv
which is befor jerusalem on the east and the mount of oliv shall
cleav in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and
there shall be a veri great valley; and half of the mountain shall
remov toward the north and half of it toward the south

14:5 and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley
of the mountain shall reach unto azal: yea ye shall flee like as ye
fled from befor the earthquak in the day of uzziah king of judah:
and the lord my god shall come and all the saint with thee

14:6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not
be clear nor dark: 14:7 but it shall be one day which shall be known
to the lord not day nor night: but it shall come to pass that at
even time it shall be light

14:8 and it shall be in that day that live water shall go out from
jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward
the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be

14:9 and the lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall
there be one lord and hi name one

14:10 all the land shall be turn as a plain from geba to rimmon
south of jerusalem: and it shall be lift up and inhabit in her
place from benjamin gate unto the place of the first gate unto the
corner gate and from the tower of hananeel unto the king
winepress

14:11 and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter
destruction; but jerusalem shall be safe inhabit

14:12 and thi shall be the plagu wherewith the lord will smite all
the peopl that have fought against jerusalem; their flesh shall
consum away while they stand upon their feet and their eye shall
consum away in their hole and their tongu shall consum away in
their mouth

14:13 and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from
the lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold everi one on the
hand of hi neighbour and hi hand shall rise up against the hand of
hi neighbour

14:14 and judah also shall fight at jerusalem; and the wealth of all
the heathen round about shall be gather togeth gold and silver
and apparel in great abund

14:15 and so shall be the plagu of the hors of the mule of the
camel and of the ass and of all the beast that shall be in these
tent as thi plagu

14:16 and it shall come to pass that everi one that is left of all
the nation which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to
year to worship the king the lord of host and to keep the feast of
tabernacl

14:17 and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the famili
of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of host
even upon them shall be no rain

14:18 and if the famili of egypt go not up and come not that have no
rain; there shall be the plagu wherewith the lord will smite the
heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacl

14:19 thi shall be the punish of egypt and the punish of all
nation that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacl

14:20 in that day shall there be upon the bell of the hors
holi unto the lord; and the pot in the lord hous shall be like
the bowl befor the altar

14:21 yea everi pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holi unto
the lord of hosts: and all they that sacrific shall come and take of
them and seeth therein: and in that day there shall be no more the
canaanit in the hous of the lord of host




malachi


1:1 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi

1:2 i have love you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hast thou
love us? wa not esau jacob brother? saith the lord: yet i love
jacob 1:3 and i hate esau and laid hi mountain and hi heritag
wast for the dragon of the wilder

1:4 wherea edom saith we are impoverish but we will return and
build the desol places; thu saith the lord of host they shall
build but i will throw down; and they shall call them the border of
wicked and the peopl against whom the lord hath indign for
ever

1:5 and your eye shall see and ye shall say the lord will be
magnifi from the border of israel

1:6 a son honoureth hi father and a servant hi master: if then i be
a father where is mine honour? and if i be a master where is my
fear? saith the lord of host unto you o priest that despis my
name and ye say wherein have we despis thi name? 1:7 ye offer
pollut bread upon mine altar; and ye say wherein have we pollut
thee? in that ye say the tabl of the lord is contempt

1:8 and if ye offer the blind for sacrific is it not evil? and if ye
offer the lame and sick is it not evil? offer it now unto thi
governor; will he be pleas with thee or accept thi person? saith
the lord of host

1:9 and now i pray you beseech god that he will be graciou unto us:
thi hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the
lord of host

1:10 who is there even among you that would shut the door for nought?
neither do ye kindl fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasur
in you saith the lord of host neither will i accept an offer at
your hand

1:11 for from the rise of the sun even unto the go down of the
same my name shall be great among the gentiles; and in everi place
incens shall be offer unto my name and a pure offering: for my
name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of host

1:12 but ye have profan it in that ye say the tabl of the lord is
polluted; and the fruit thereof even hi meat is contempt

1:13 ye said also behold what a weari is it! and ye have snuf
at it saith the lord of hosts; and ye brought that which wa torn
and the lame and the sick; thu ye brought an offering: should i
accept thi of your hand? saith the lord

1:14 but curs be the deceiv which hath in hi flock a male and
voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing: for i am a
great king saith the lord of host and my name is dread among the
heathen

2:1 and now o ye priest thi command is for you

2:2 if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give
glori unto my name saith the lord of host i will even send a curs
upon you and i will curs your blessings: yea i have curs them
alreadi becaus ye do not lay it to heart

2:3 behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your face
even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with
it

2:4 and ye shall know that i have sent thi command unto you that
my coven might be with levi saith the lord of host

2:5 my coven wa with him of life and peace; and i gave them to him
for the fear wherewith he fear me and wa afraid befor my name

2:6 the law of truth wa in hi mouth and iniqu wa not found in
hi lips: he walk with me in peac and equiti and did turn mani
away from iniqu

2:7 for the priest lip should keep knowledg and they should seek
the law at hi mouth: for he is the messeng of the lord of host

2:8 but ye are depart out of the way; ye have caus mani to stumbl
at the law; ye have corrupt the coven of levi saith the lord of
host

2:9 therefor have i also made you contempt and base befor all
the peopl accord as ye have not kept my way but have been
partial in the law

2:10 have we not all one father? hath not one god creat us? whi do
we deal treacher everi man against hi brother by profan the
coven of our fathers? 2:11 judah hath dealt treacher and an
abomin is commit in israel and in jerusalem; for judah hath
profan the holi of the lord which he love and hath marri the
daughter of a strang god

2:12 the lord will cut off the man that doeth thi the master and the
scholar out of the tabernacl of jacob and him that offereth an
offer unto the lord of host

2:13 and thi have ye done again cover the altar of the lord with
tear with weep and with cri out insomuch that he regardeth
not the offer ani more or receiveth it with good will at your
hand

2:14 yet ye say wherefore? becaus the lord hath been wit between
thee and the wife of thi youth against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously: yet is she thi companion and the wife of thi coven

2:15 and did not he make one? yet had he the residu of the spirit
and wherefor one? that he might seek a godli seed therefor take
heed to your spirit and let none deal treacher against the wife
of hi youth

2:16 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth put
away: for one covereth violenc with hi garment saith the lord of
hosts: therefor take heed to your spirit that ye deal not
treacher

2:17 ye have weari the lord with your word yet ye say wherein
have we weari him? when ye say everi one that doeth evil is good in
the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them; or where is the god
of judgment? 3:1 behold i will send my messeng and he shall
prepar the way befor me: and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenli
come to hi templ even the messeng of the coven whom ye
delight in: behold he shall come saith the lord of host

3:2 but who may abid the day of hi coming? and who shall stand when
he appeareth? for he is like a refin fire and like fuller soap:
3:3 and he shall sit as a refin and purifi of silver: and he shall
purifi the son of levi and purg them as gold and silver that they
may offer unto the lord an offer in righteous

3:4 then shall the offer of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto
the lord as in the day of old and as in former year

3:5 and i will come near to you to judgment; and i will be a swift
wit against the sorcer and against the adulter and against
fals swearer and against those that oppress the hirel in hi
wage the widow and the fatherless and that turn asid the stranger
from hi right and fear not me saith the lord of host

3:6 for i am the lord i chang not; therefor ye son of jacob are
not consum

3:7 even from the day of your father ye are gone away from mine
ordin and have not kept them return unto me and i will return
unto you saith the lord of host but ye said wherein shall we
return? 3:8 will a man rob god? yet ye have rob me but ye say
wherein have we rob thee? in tith and offer

3:9 ye are curs with a curse: for ye have rob me even thi whole
nation

3:10 bring ye all the tith into the storehous that there may be
meat in mine hous and prove me now herewith saith the lord of
host if i will not open you the window of heaven and pour you out
a bless that there shall not be room enough to receiv it

3:11 and i will rebuk the devour for your sake and he shall not
destroy the fruit of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her
fruit befor the time in the field saith the lord of host

3:12 and all nation shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
delightsom land saith the lord of host

3:13 your word have been stout against me saith the lord yet ye
say what have we spoken so much against thee? 3:14 ye have said it
is vain to serv god: and what profit is it that we have kept hi
ordin and that we have walk mourn befor the lord of
hosts? 3:15 and now we call the proud happy; yea they that work
wicked are set up; yea they that tempt god are even deliv

3:16 then they that fear the lord spake often one to another: and
the lord hearken and heard it and a book of remembr wa
written befor him for them that fear the lord and that thought
upon hi name

3:17 and they shall be mine saith the lord of host in that day when
i make up my jewels; and i will spare them as a man spareth hi own
son that serveth him

3:18 then shall ye return and discern between the righteou and the
wick between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not

4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all
the proud yea and all that do wickedli shall be stubble: and the
day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of host that it
shall leav them neither root nor branch

4:2 but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteous
aris with heal in hi wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as
calv of the stall

4:3 and ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ash under
the sole of your feet in the day that i shall do thi saith the lord
of host

4:4 rememb ye the law of mose my servant which i command unto
him in horeb for all israel with the statut and judgment

4:5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet befor the come of
the great and dread day of the lord: 4:6 and he shall turn the
heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to
their father lest i come and smite the earth with a curs

child and hi mother and go into the land of israel: for they are
dead which sought the young child life

2:21 and he aros and took the young child and hi mother and came
into the land of israel

2:22 but when he heard that archelau did reign in judaea in the room
of hi father herod he wa afraid to go thither: notwithstand
be warn of god in a dream he turn asid into the part of
galilee: 2:23 and he came and dwelt in a citi call nazareth: that it
might be fulfil which wa spoken by the prophet he shall be
call a nazaren

3:1 in those day came john the baptist preach in the wilder
of judaea 3:2 and say repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand

3:3 for thi is he that wa spoken of by the prophet esaia say
the voic of one cri in the wilder prepar ye the way of the
lord make hi path straight

3:4 and the same john had hi raiment of camel hair and a leathern
girdl about hi loins; and hi meat wa locust and wild honey

3:5 then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region
round about jordan 3:6 and were baptiz of him in jordan confess
their sin

3:7 but when he saw mani of the pharise and sadduce come to hi
baptism he said unto them o gener of viper who hath warn
you to flee from the wrath to come? 3:8 bring forth therefor fruit
meet for repentance: 3:9 and think not to say within yourselv we
have abraham to our father: for i say unto you that god is abl of
these stone to rais up children unto abraham

3:10 and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
therefor everi tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down
and cast into the fire

3:11 i inde baptiz you with water unto repent but he that
cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoe i am not worthi to
bear: he shall baptiz you with the holi ghost and with fire: 3:12
whose fan is in hi hand and he will throughli purg hi floor and
gather hi wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
unquench fire

3:13 then cometh jesu from galile to jordan unto john to be
baptiz of him

3:14 but john forbad him say i have need to be baptiz of thee
and comest thou to me? 3:15 and jesu answer said unto him suffer
it to be so now: for thu it becometh us to fulfil all righteous
then he suffer him

3:16 and jesu when he wa baptiz went up straightway out of the
water: and lo the heaven were open unto him and he saw the
spirit of god descend like a dove and light upon him: 3:17 and
lo a voic from heaven say thi is my belov son in whom i am
well pleas

4:1 then wa jesu led up of the spirit into the wilder to be
tempt of the devil

4:2 and when he had fast forti day and forti night he wa
afterward an hungr

4:3 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of
god command that these stone be made bread

4:4 but he answer and said it is written man shall not live by
bread alon but by everi word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
god

4:5 then the devil taketh him up into the holi citi and setteth him
on a pinnacl of the templ 4:6 and saith unto him if thou be the
son of god cast thyself down: for it is written he shall give hi
angel charg concern thee: and in their hand they shall bear thee
up lest at ani time thou dash thi foot against a stone

4:7 jesu said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the
lord thi god

4:8 again the devil taketh him up into an exceed high mountain
and sheweth him all the kingdom of the world and the glori of them;
4:9 and saith unto him all these thing will i give thee if thou
wilt fall down and worship me

4:10 then saith jesu unto him get thee henc satan: for it is
written thou shalt worship the lord thi god and him onli shalt thou
serv

4:11 then the devil leaveth him and behold angel came and
minist unto him

4:12 now when jesu had heard that john wa cast into prison he
depart into galilee; 4:13 and leav nazareth he came and dwelt in
capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the border of zabulon and
nephthalim: 4:14 that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by esaia
the prophet say 4:15 the land of zabulon and the land of
nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galile of the
gentiles; 4:16 the peopl which sat in dark saw great light; and
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
up

4:17 from that time jesu began to preach and to say repent: for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand

4:18 and jesu walk by the sea of galile saw two brethren simon
call peter and andrew hi brother cast a net into the sea: for
they were fisher

4:19 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fisher of
men

4:20 and they straightway left their net and follow him

4:21 and go on from thenc he saw other two brethren jame the
son of zebede and john hi brother in a ship with zebede their
father mend their nets; and he call them

4:22 and they immedi left the ship and their father and follow
him

4:23 and jesu went about all galile teach in their synagogu
and preach the gospel of the kingdom and heal all manner of
sick and all manner of diseas among the peopl

4:24 and hi fame went throughout all syria: and they brought unto him
all sick peopl that were taken with diver diseas and torment and
those which were possess with devil and those which were lunatick
and those that had the palsy; and he heal them

4:25 and there follow him great multitud of peopl from galile
and from decapoli and from jerusalem and from judaea and from
beyond jordan

5:1 and see the multitud he went up into a mountain: and when he
wa set hi discipl came unto him: 5:2 and he open hi mouth and
taught them say 5:3 bless are the poor in spirit: for their is
the kingdom of heaven

5:4 bless are they that mourn: for they shall be comfort

5:5 bless are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth

5:6 bless are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
for they shall be fill

5:7 bless are the merciful: for they shall obtain merci

5:8 bless are the pure in heart: for they shall see god

5:9 bless are the peacemakers: for they shall be call the children
of god

5:10 bless are they which are persecut for righteous sake:
for their is the kingdom of heaven

5:11 bless are ye when men shall revil you and persecut you and
shall say all manner of evil against you fals for my sake

5:12 rejoic and be exceed glad: for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecut they the prophet which were befor you

5:13 ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost hi
savour wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
noth but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men

5:14 ye are the light of the world a citi that is set on an hill
cannot be hid

5:15 neither do men light a candl and put it under a bushel but on
a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the hous

5:16 let your light so shine befor men that they may see your good
work and glorifi your father which is in heaven

5:17 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets: i
am not come to destroy but to fulfil

5:18 for verili i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or
one tittl shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfil

5:19 whosoev therefor shall break one of these least command
and shall teach men so he shall be call the least in the kingdom of
heaven: but whosoev shall do and teach them the same shall be
call great in the kingdom of heaven

5:20 for i say unto you that except your righteous shall exceed
the righteous of the scribe and pharise ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven

5:21 ye have heard that it wa said of them of old time thou shalt
not kill; and whosoev shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
5:22 but i say unto you that whosoev is angri with hi brother
without a caus shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoev
shall say to hi brother raca shall be in danger of the council: but
whosoev shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire

5:23 therefor if thou bring thi gift to the altar and there
rememberest that thi brother hath ought against thee; 5:24 leav there
thi gift befor the altar and go thi way; first be reconcil to thi
brother and then come and offer thi gift

5:25 agre with thine adversari quickli while thou art in the way
with him; lest at ani time the adversari deliv thee to the judg
and the judg deliv thee to the offic and thou be cast into
prison

5:26 verili i say unto thee thou shalt by no mean come out thenc
till thou hast paid the uttermost farth

5:27 ye have heard that it wa said by them of old time thou shalt
not commit adultery: 5:28 but i say unto you that whosoev looketh
on a woman to lust after her hath commit adulteri with her alreadi
in hi heart

5:29 and if thi right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee: for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should
perish and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell

5:30 and if thi right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from
thee: for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should
perish and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell

5:31 it hath been said whosoev shall put away hi wife let him
give her a write of divorcement: 5:32 but i say unto you that
whosoev shall put away hi wife save for the caus of
fornic causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoev shall marri
her that is divorc committeth adulteri

5:33 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time
thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine
oaths: 5:34 but i say unto you swear not at all; neither by heaven;
for it is god throne: 5:35 nor by the earth; for it is hi
footstool: neither by jerusalem; for it is the citi of the great king

5:36 neither shalt thou swear by thi head becaus thou canst not make
one hair white or black

5:37 but let your commun be yea yea; nay nay: for whatsoev
is more than these cometh of evil

5:38 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth: 5:39 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil:
but whosoev shall smite thee on thi right cheek turn to him the
other also

5:40 and if ani man will sue thee at the law and take away thi coat
let him have thi cloak also

5:41 and whosoev shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain

5:42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away

5:43 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thi
neighbour and hate thine enemi

5:44 but i say unto you love your enemi bless them that curs you
do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despit
use you and persecut you; 5:45 that ye may be the children of your
father which is in heaven: for he maketh hi sun to rise on the evil
and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust

5:46 for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye? do not
even the publican the same? 5:47 and if ye salut your brethren
onli what do ye more than others? do not even the publican so? 5:48
be ye therefor perfect even as your father which is in heaven is
perfect

6:1 take heed that ye do not your alm befor men to be seen of them:
otherwis ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven

6:2 therefor when thou doest thine alm do not sound a trumpet
befor thee as the hypocrit do in the synagogu and in the
street that they may have glori of men verili i say unto you they
have their reward

6:3 but when thou doest alm let not thi left hand know what thi
right hand doeth: 6:4 that thine alm may be in secret: and thi father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openli

6:5 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrit are:
for they love to pray stand in the synagogu and in the corner of
the street that they may be seen of men verili i say unto you they
have their reward

6:6 but thou when thou prayest enter into thi closet and when thou
hast shut thi door pray to thi father which is in secret; and thi
father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openli

6:7 but when ye pray use not vain repetit as the heathen do: for
they think that they shall be heard for their much speak

6:8 be not ye therefor like unto them: for your father knoweth what
thing ye have need of befor ye ask him

6:9 after thi manner therefor pray ye: our father which art in
heaven hallow be thi name

6:10 thi kingdom come thi will be done in earth as it is in heaven

6:11 give us thi day our daili bread

6:12 and forgiv us our debt as we forgiv our debtor

6:13 and lead us not into temptat but deliv us from evil: for
thine is the kingdom and the power and the glori for ever amen

6:14 for if ye forgiv men their trespass your heavenli father will
also forgiv you: 6:15 but if ye forgiv not men their trespass
neither will your father forgiv your trespass

6:16 moreov when ye fast be not as the hypocrit of a sad
countenance: for they disfigur their face that they may appear unto
men to fast verili i say unto you they have their reward

6:17 but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thi
face; 6:18 that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thi father
which is in secret: and thi father which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openli

6:19 lay not up for yourselv treasur upon earth where moth and
rust doth corrupt and where thiev break through and steal: 6:20 but
lay up for yourselv treasur in heaven where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt and where thiev do not break through nor steal: 6:21
for where your treasur is there will your heart be also

6:22 the light of the bodi is the eye: if therefor thine eye be
singl thi whole bodi shall be full of light

6:23 but if thine eye be evil thi whole bodi shall be full of
dark

if therefor the light that is in thee be dark how great is that
darkness! 6:24 no man can serv two masters: for either he will hate
the one and love the other; or els he will hold to the one and
despis the other ye cannot serv god and mammon

6:25 therefor i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye
shall eat or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your bodi what ye
shall put on is not the life more than meat and the bodi than
raiment? 6:26 behold the fowl of the air: for they sow not neither
do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenli father feedeth
them are ye not much better than they? 6:27 which of you by take
thought can add one cubit unto hi stature? 6:28 and whi take ye
thought for raiment? consid the lili of the field how they grow;
they toil not neither do they spin: 6:29 and yet i say unto you that
even solomon in all hi glori wa not array like one of these

6:30 wherefor if god so cloth the grass of the field which to day
is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more cloth
you o ye of littl faith? 6:31 therefor take no thought say
what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewith shall we
be clothed? 6:32 (for after all these thing do the gentil seek:)
for your heavenli father knoweth that ye have need of all these
thing

6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and hi righteousness; and
all these thing shall be ad unto you

6:34 take therefor no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
take thought for the thing of itself suffici unto the day is the
evil thereof

7:1 judg not that ye be not judg

7:2 for with what judgment ye judg ye shall be judged: and with what
measur ye mete it shall be measur to you again

7:3 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother eye but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 7:4 or how wilt
thou say to thi brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;
and behold a beam is in thine own eye? 7:5 thou hypocrit first
cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see
clearli to cast out the mote out of thi brother eye

7:6 give not that which is holi unto the dog neither cast ye your
pearl befor swine lest they trampl them under their feet and turn
again and rend you

7:7 ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock
and it shall be open unto you: 7:8 for everi one that asketh
receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it
shall be open

7:9 or what man is there of you whom if hi son ask bread will he
give him a stone? 7:10 or if he ask a fish will he give him a
serpent? 7:11 if ye then be evil know how to give good gift
unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven
give good thing to them that ask him? 7:12 therefor all thing
whatsoev ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them:
for thi is the law and the prophet

7:13 enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate and broad
is the way that leadeth to destruct and mani there be which go in
thereat: 7:14 becaus strait is the gate and narrow is the way which
leadeth unto life and few there be that find it

7:15 bewar of fals prophet which come to you in sheep cloth
but inwardli they are raven wolv

7:16 ye shall know them by their fruit do men gather grape of
thorn or fig of thistles? 7:17 even so everi good tree bringeth
forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit

7:18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit

7:19 everi tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and
cast into the fire

7:20 wherefor by their fruit ye shall know them

7:21 not everi one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which
is in heaven

7:22 mani will say to me in that day lord lord have we not
prophesi in thi name? and in thi name have cast out devils? and in
thi name done mani wonder works? 7:23 and then will i profess unto
them i never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniqu

7:24 therefor whosoev heareth these say of mine and doeth
them i will liken him unto a wise man which built hi hous upon a
rock: 7:25 and the rain descend and the flood came and the wind
blew and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it wa found
upon a rock

7:26 and everi one that heareth these say of mine and doeth them
not shall be liken unto a foolish man which built hi hous upon
the sand: 7:27 and the rain descend and the flood came and the
wind blew and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great wa the
fall of it

7:28 and it came to pass when jesu had end these say the
peopl were astonish at hi doctrine: 7:29 for he taught them as one
have author and not as the scribe

8:1 when he wa come down from the mountain great multitud follow
him

8:2 and behold there came a leper and worship him say lord
if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

8:3 and jesu put forth hi hand and touch him say i will; be
thou clean and immedi hi leprosi wa cleans

8:4 and jesu saith unto him see thou tell no man; but go thi way
shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that mose command
for a testimoni unto them

8:5 and when jesu wa enter into capernaum there came unto him a
centurion beseech him 8:6 and say lord my servant lieth at
home sick of the palsi grievous torment

8:7 and jesu saith unto him i will come and heal him

8:8 the centurion answer and said lord i am not worthi that thou
shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word onli and my servant
shall be heal

8:9 for i am a man under author have soldier under me: and i
say to thi man go and he goeth; and to anoth come and he
cometh; and to my servant do thi and he doeth it

8:10 when jesu heard it he marvel and said to them that
follow verili i say unto you i have not found so great faith no
not in israel

8:11 and i say unto you that mani shall come from the east and west
and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom
of heaven

8:12 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness: there shall be weep and gnash of teeth

8:13 and jesu said unto the centurion go thi way; and as thou hast
believ so be it done unto thee and hi servant wa heal in the
selfsam hour

8:14 and when jesu wa come into peter hous he saw hi wife
mother laid and sick of a fever

8:15 and he touch her hand and the fever left her: and she aros
and minist unto them

8:16 when the even wa come they brought unto him mani that were
possess with devils: and he cast out the spirit with hi word and
heal all that were sick: 8:17 that it might be fulfil which wa
spoken by esaia the prophet say himself took our infirm
and bare our sick

8:18 now when jesu saw great multitud about him he gave
command to depart unto the other side

8:19 and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will
follow thee whithersoev thou goest

8:20 and jesu saith unto him the fox have hole and the bird of
the air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay hi head

8:21 and anoth of hi discipl said unto him lord suffer me first
to go and buri my father

8:22 but jesu said unto him follow me; and let the dead buri their
dead

8:23 and when he wa enter into a ship hi discipl follow him

8:24 and behold there aros a great tempest in the sea insomuch
that the ship wa cover with the waves: but he wa asleep

8:25 and hi discipl came to him and awok him say lord save
us: we perish

8:26 and he saith unto them whi are ye fear o ye of littl faith?
then he aros and rebuk the wind and the sea; and there wa a
great calm

8:27 but the men marvel say what manner of man is thi that
even the wind and the sea obey him! 8:28 and when he wa come to the
other side into the countri of the gergesen there met him two
possess with devil come out of the tomb exceed fierc so
that no man might pass by that way

8:29 and behold they cri out say what have we to do with
thee jesu thou son of god? art thou come hither to torment us
befor the time? 8:30 and there wa a good way off from them an herd
of mani swine feed

8:31 so the devil besought him say if thou cast us out suffer
us to go away into the herd of swine

8:32 and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went
into the herd of swine: and behold the whole herd of swine ran
violent down a steep place into the sea and perish in the water

8:33 and they that kept them fled and went their way into the citi
and told everi thing and what wa befallen to the possess of the
devil

8:34 and behold the whole citi came out to meet jesus: and when they
saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coast

9:1 and he enter into a ship and pass over and came into hi own
citi

9:2 and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsi lie on
a bed: and jesu see their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;
son be of good cheer; thi sin be forgiven thee

9:3 and behold certain of the scribe said within themselv thi
man blasphemeth

9:4 and jesu know their thought said wherefor think ye evil in
your hearts? 9:5 for whether is easier to say thi sin be forgiven
thee; or to say aris and walk? 9:6 but that ye may know that the
son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin (then saith he to the
sick of the palsy) aris take up thi bed and go unto thine hous

9:7 and he aros and depart to hi hous

9:8 but when the multitud saw it they marvel and glorifi god
which had given such power unto men

9:9 and as jesu pass forth from thenc he saw a man name
matthew sit at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him
follow me and he aros and follow him

9:10 and it came to pass as jesu sat at meat in the hous behold
mani publican and sinner came and sat down with him and hi
discipl

9:11 and when the pharise saw it they said unto hi discipl whi
eateth your master with publican and sinners? 9:12 but when jesu
heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a
physician but they that are sick

9:13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have merci and not
sacrifice: for i am not come to call the righteou but sinner to
repent

9:14 then came to him the discipl of john say whi do we and the
pharise fast oft but thi discipl fast not? 9:15 and jesu said
unto them can the children of the bridechamb mourn as long as the
bridegroom is with them? but the day will come when the bridegroom
shall be taken from them and then shall they fast

9:16 no man putteth a piec of new cloth unto an old garment for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is
made wors

9:17 neither do men put new wine into old bottles: els the bottl
break and the wine runneth out and the bottl perish: but they put
new wine into new bottl and both are preserv

9:18 while he spake these thing unto them behold there came a
certain ruler and worship him say my daughter is even now
dead: but come and lay thi hand upon her and she shall live

9:19 and jesu aros and follow him and so did hi discipl

9:20 and behold a woman which wa diseas with an issu of blood
twelv year came behind him and touch the hem of hi garment:
9:21 for she said within herself if i may but touch hi garment i
shall be whole

9:22 but jesu turn him about and when he saw her he said
daughter be of good comfort; thi faith hath made thee whole and the
woman wa made whole from that hour

9:23 and when jesu came into the ruler hous and saw the minstrel
and the peopl make a nois 9:24 he said unto them give place: for
the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laugh him to scorn

9:25 but when the peopl were put forth he went in and took her by
the hand and the maid aros

9:26 and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land

9:27 and when jesu depart thenc two blind men follow him
cri and say thou son of david have merci on us

9:28 and when he wa come into the hous the blind men came to him:
and jesu saith unto them believ ye that i am abl to do this? they
said unto him yea lord

9:29 then touch he their eye say accord to your faith be it
unto you

9:30 and their eye were opened; and jesu straitli charg them
say see that no man know it

9:31 but they when they were depart spread abroad hi fame in all
that countri

9:32 as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man
possess with a devil

9:33 and when the devil wa cast out the dumb spake: and the
multitud marvel say it wa never so seen in israel

9:34 but the pharise said he casteth out devil through the princ
of the devil

9:35 and jesu went about all the citi and villag teach in
their synagogu and preach the gospel of the kingdom and heal
everi sick and everi diseas among the peopl

9:36 but when he saw the multitud he wa move with compass on
them becaus they faint and were scatter abroad as sheep have
no shepherd

9:37 then saith he unto hi discipl the harvest truli is plenteou
but the labour are few; 9:38 pray ye therefor the lord of the
harvest that he will send forth labour into hi harvest

10:1 and when he had call unto him hi twelv discipl he gave
them power against unclean spirit to cast them out and to heal all
manner of sick and all manner of diseas

10:2 now the name of the twelv apostl are these; the first simon
who is call peter and andrew hi brother; jame the son of zebede
and john hi brother; 10:3 philip and bartholomew; thoma and
matthew the publican; jame the son of alphaeu and lebbaeu whose
surnam wa thaddaeus; 10:4 simon the canaanit and juda iscariot
who also betray him

10:5 these twelv jesu sent forth and command them say go not
into the way of the gentil and into ani citi of the samaritan
enter ye not: 10:6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the hous of
israel

10:7 and as ye go preach say the kingdom of heaven is at hand

10:8 heal the sick cleans the leper rais the dead cast out
devils: freeli ye have receiv freeli give

10:9 provid neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purs 10:10
nor scrip for your journey neither two coat neither shoe nor yet
staves: for the workman is worthi of hi meat

10:11 and into whatsoev citi or town ye shall enter enquir who in
it is worthy; and there abid till ye go thenc

10:12 and when ye come into an hous salut it

10:13 and if the hous be worthi let your peac come upon it: but if
it be not worthi let your peac return to you

10:14 and whosoev shall not receiv you nor hear your word when
ye depart out of that hous or citi shake off the dust of your feet

10:15 verili i say unto you it shall be more toler for the land
of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that citi

10:16 behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
therefor wise as serpent and harmless as dove

10:17 but bewar of men: for they will deliv you up to the council
and they will scourg you in their synagogues; 10:18 and ye shall be
brought befor governor and king for my sake for a testimoni
against them and the gentil

10:19 but when they deliv you up take no thought how or what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak

10:20 for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which
speaketh in you

10:21 and the brother shall deliv up the brother to death and the
father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
parent and caus them to be put to death

10:22 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name sake: but he that
endureth to the end shall be save

10:23 but when they persecut you in thi citi flee ye into another:
for verili i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the citi of
israel till the son of man be come

10:24 the discipl is not abov hi master nor the servant abov hi
lord

10:25 it is enough for the discipl that he be as hi master and the
servant as hi lord if they have call the master of the hous
beelzebub how much more shall they call them of hi household? 10:26
fear them not therefore: for there is noth cover that shall not
be revealed; and hid that shall not be known

10:27 what i tell you in dark that speak ye in light: and what ye
hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetop

10:28 and fear not them which kill the bodi but are not abl to kill
the soul: but rather fear him which is abl to destroy both soul and
bodi in hell

10:29 are not two sparrow sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your father

10:30 but the veri hair of your head are all number

10:31 fear ye not therefor ye are of more valu than mani sparrow

10:32 whosoev therefor shall confess me befor men him will i
confess also befor my father which is in heaven

10:33 but whosoev shall deni me befor men him will i also deni
befor my father which is in heaven

10:34 think not that i am come to send peac on earth: i came not to
send peac but a sword

10:35 for i am come to set a man at varianc against hi father and
the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her
mother in law

10:36 and a man foe shall be they of hi own household

10:37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthi of
me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthi of
me

10:38 and he that taketh not hi cross and followeth after me is not
worthi of me

10:39 he that findeth hi life shall lose it: and he that loseth hi
life for my sake shall find it

10:40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me

10:41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receiv a prophet reward; and he that receiveth a righteou man in
the name of a righteou man shall receiv a righteou man reward

10:42 and whosoev shall give to drink unto one of these littl one
a cup of cold water onli in the name of a discipl verili i say unto
you he shall in no wise lose hi reward

11:1 and it came to pass when jesu had made an end of command hi
twelv discipl he depart thenc to teach and to preach in their
citi

11:2 now when john had heard in the prison the work of christ he
sent two of hi discipl 11:3 and said unto him art thou he that
should come or do we look for another? 11:4 jesu answer and said
unto them go and shew john again those thing which ye do hear and
see: 11:5 the blind receiv their sight and the lame walk the leper
are cleans and the deaf hear the dead are rais up and the poor
have the gospel preach to them

11:6 and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me

11:7 and as they depart jesu began to say unto the multitud
concern john what went ye out into the wilder to see? a reed
shaken with the wind? 11:8 but what went ye out for to see? a man
cloth in soft raiment? behold they that wear soft cloth are in
king hous

11:9 but what went ye out for to see? a prophet? yea i say unto you
and more than a prophet

11:10 for thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my
messeng befor thi face which shall prepar thi way befor thee

11:11 verili i say unto you among them that are born of women there
hath not risen a greater than john the baptist: notwithstand he
that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he

11:12 and from the day of john the baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violenc and the violent take it by forc

11:13 for all the prophet and the law prophesi until john

11:14 and if ye will receiv it thi is elia which wa for to come

11:15 he that hath ear to hear let him hear

11:16 but whereunto shall i liken thi generation? it is like unto
children sit in the market and call unto their fellow 11:17
and say we have pipe unto you and ye have not danced; we have
mourn unto you and ye have not lament

11:18 for john came neither eat nor drink and they say he hath
a devil

11:19 the son of man came eat and drink and they say behold a
man glutton and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinner
but wisdom is justifi of her children

11:20 then began he to upbraid the citi wherein most of hi mighti
work were done becaus they repent not: 11:21 woe unto thee
chorazin! woe unto thee bethsaida! for if the mighti work which
were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have
repent long ago in sackcloth and ash

11:22 but i say unto you it shall be more toler for tyre and
sidon at the day of judgment than for you

11:23 and thou capernaum which art exalt unto heaven shalt be
brought down to hell: for if the mighti work which have been done in
thee had been done in sodom it would have remain until thi day

11:24 but i say unto you that it shall be more toler for the land
of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee

11:25 at that time jesu answer and said i thank thee o father
lord of heaven and earth becaus thou hast hid these thing from the
wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe

11:26 even so father: for so it seem good in thi sight

11:27 all thing are deliv unto me of my father: and no man
knoweth the son but the father; neither knoweth ani man the father
save the son and he to whomsoev the son will reveal him

11:28 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavi laden and i will
give you rest

11:29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for i am meek and lowli
in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your soul

11:30 for my yoke is easi and my burden is light

12:1 at that time jesu went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
hi discipl were an hungr and began to pluck the ear of corn and
to eat

12:2 but when the pharise saw it they said unto him behold thi
discipl do that which is not law to do upon the sabbath day

12:3 but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he
wa an hungr and they that were with him; 12:4 how he enter into
the hous of god and did eat the shewbread which wa not law for
him to eat neither for them which were with him but onli for the
priests? 12:5 or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath
day the priest in the templ profan the sabbath and are blameless?
12:6 but i say unto you that in thi place is one greater than the
templ

12:7 but if ye had known what thi meaneth i will have merci and not
sacrific ye would not have condemn the guiltless

12:8 for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day

12:9 and when he wa depart thenc he went into their synagogue:
12:10 and behold there wa a man which had hi hand wither and
they ask him say is it law to heal on the sabbath days? that
they might accus him

12:11 and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that
shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day
will he not lay hold on it and lift it out? 12:12 how much then is a
man better than a sheep? wherefor it is law to do well on the
sabbath day

12:13 then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he
stretch it forth; and it wa restor whole like as the other

12:14 then the pharise went out and held a council against him how
they might destroy him

12:15 but when jesu knew it he withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitud follow him and he heal them all; 12:16 and
charg them that they should not make him known: 12:17 that it might
be fulfil which wa spoken by esaia the prophet say 12:18
behold my servant whom i have chosen; my belov in whom my soul is
well pleased: i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew
judgment to the gentil

12:19 he shall not strive nor cry; neither shall ani man hear hi
voic in the street

12:20 a bruis reed shall he not break and smoke flax shall he not
quench till he send forth judgment unto victori

12:21 and in hi name shall the gentil trust

12:22 then wa brought unto him one possess with a devil blind and
dumb: and he heal him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake
and saw

12:23 and all the peopl were amaz and said is not thi the son of
david? 12:24 but when the pharise heard it they said thi fellow
doth not cast out devil but by beelzebub the princ of the devil

12:25 and jesu knew their thought and said unto them everi kingdom
divid against itself is brought to desolation; and everi citi or
hous divid against itself shall not stand: 12:26 and if satan cast
out satan he is divid against himself; how shall then hi kingdom
stand? 12:27 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your
children cast them out? therefor they shall be your judg

12:28 but if i cast out devil by the spirit of god then the kingdom
of god is come unto you

12:29 or els how can one enter into a strong man hous and spoil
hi good except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil
hi hous

12:30 he that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth abroad

12:31 wherefor i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemi shall
be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemi against the holi ghost shall
not be forgiven unto men

12:32 and whosoev speaketh a word against the son of man it shall
be forgiven him: but whosoev speaketh against the holi ghost it
shall not be forgiven him neither in thi world neither in the world
to come

12:33 either make the tree good and hi fruit good; or els make the
tree corrupt and hi fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by hi
fruit

12:34 o gener of viper how can ye be evil speak good
things? for out of the abund of the heart the mouth speaketh

12:35 a good man out of the good treasur of the heart bringeth forth
good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasur bringeth forth
evil thing

12:36 but i say unto you that everi idl word that men shall speak
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment

12:37 for by thi word thou shalt be justifi and by thi word thou
shalt be condemn

12:38 then certain of the scribe and of the pharise answer
say master we would see a sign from thee

12:39 but he answer and said unto them an evil and adulter
gener seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to
it but the sign of the prophet jonas: 12:40 for as jona wa three
day and three night in the whale belly; so shall the son of man be
three day and three night in the heart of the earth

12:41 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with thi gener
and shall condemn it: becaus they repent at the preach of jonas;
and behold a greater than jona is here

12:42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with thi
gener and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost
part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and behold a
greater than solomon is here

12:43 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
dri place seek rest and findeth none

12:44 then he saith i will return into my hous from whenc i came
out; and when he is come he findeth it empti swept and garnish

12:45 then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirit more
wick than himself and they enter in and dwell there: and the last
state of that man is wors than the first even so shall it be also
unto thi wick gener

12:46 while he yet talk to the peopl behold hi mother and hi
brethren stood without desir to speak with him

12:47 then one said unto him behold thi mother and thi brethren
stand without desir to speak with thee

12:48 but he answer and said unto him that told him who is my
mother? and who are my brethren? 12:49 and he stretch forth hi
hand toward hi discipl and said behold my mother and my brethren!
12:50 for whosoev shall do the will of my father which is in heaven
the same is my brother and sister and mother

13:1 the same day went jesu out of the hous and sat by the sea
side

13:2 and great multitud were gather togeth unto him so that he
went into a ship and sat; and the whole multitud stood on the shore

13:3 and he spake mani thing unto them in parabl say behold a
sower went forth to sow; 13:4 and when he sow some seed fell by
the way side and the fowl came and devour them up: 13:5 some fell
upon stoni place where they had not much earth: and forthwith they
sprung up becaus they had no deep of earth: 13:6 and when the
sun wa up they were scorched; and becaus they had no root they
wither away

13:7 and some fell among thorns; and the thorn sprung up and choke
them: 13:8 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit
some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold

13:9 who hath ear to hear let him hear

13:10 and the discipl came and said unto him whi speakest thou
unto them in parables? 13:11 he answer and said unto them becaus
it is given unto you to know the mysteri of the kingdom of heaven
but to them it is not given

13:12 for whosoev hath to him shall be given and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoev hath not from him shall be taken away
even that he hath

13:13 therefor speak i to them in parables: becaus they see see
not; and hear they hear not neither do they understand

13:14 and in them is fulfil the propheci of esaia which saith by
hear ye shall hear and shall not understand; and see ye shall
see and shall not perceive: 13:15 for thi peopl heart is wax
gross and their ear are dull of hear and their eye they have
closed; lest at ani time they should see with their eye and hear with
their ear and should understand with their heart and should be
convert and i should heal them

13:16 but bless are your eye for they see: and your ear for they
hear

13:17 for verili i say unto you that mani prophet and righteou men
have desir to see those thing which ye see and have not seen them;
and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them

13:18 hear ye therefor the parabl of the sower

13:19 when ani one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth
it not then cometh the wick one and catcheth away that which wa
sown in hi heart thi is he which receiv seed by the way side

13:20 but he that receiv the seed into stoni place the same is he
that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it; 13:21 yet hath
he not root in himself but dureth for a while: for when tribul
or persecut ariseth becaus of the word by and by he is offend

13:22 he also that receiv seed among the thorn is he that heareth
the word; and the care of thi world and the deceit of rich
choke the word and he becometh unfruit

13:23 but he that receiv seed into the good ground is he that
heareth the word and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit and
bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixti some thirti

13:24 anoth parabl put he forth unto them say the kingdom of
heaven is liken unto a man which sow good seed in hi field: 13:25
but while men slept hi enemi came and sow tare among the wheat
and went hi way

13:26 but when the blade wa sprung up and brought forth fruit then
appear the tare also

13:27 so the servant of the household came and said unto him sir
didst not thou sow good seed in thi field? from whenc then hath it
tares? 13:28 he said unto them an enemi hath done thi the servant
said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 13:29
but he said nay; lest while ye gather up the tare ye root up also
the wheat with them

13:30 let both grow togeth until the harvest: and in the time of
harvest i will say to the reaper gather ye togeth first the tare
and bind them in bundl to burn them: but gather the wheat into my
barn

13:31 anoth parabl put he forth unto them say the kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sow
in hi field: 13:32 which inde is the least of all seeds: but when
it is grown it is the greatest among herb and becometh a tree so
that the bird of the air come and lodg in the branch thereof

13:33 anoth parabl spake he unto them; the kingdom of heaven is
like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur of
meal till the whole wa leaven

13:34 all these thing spake jesu unto the multitud in parables; and
without a parabl spake he not unto them: 13:35 that it might be
fulfil which wa spoken by the prophet say i will open my
mouth in parables; i will utter thing which have been kept secret
from the foundat of the world

13:36 then jesu sent the multitud away and went into the house: and
hi discipl came unto him say declar unto us the parabl of
the tare of the field

13:37 he answer and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is
the son of man; 13:38 the field is the world; the good seed are the
children of the kingdom; but the tare are the children of the wick
one; 13:39 the enemi that sow them is the devil; the harvest is the
end of the world; and the reaper are the angel

13:40 as therefor the tare are gather and burn in the fire; so
shall it be in the end of thi world

13:41 the son of man shall send forth hi angel and they shall
gather out of hi kingdom all thing that offend and them which do
iniquity; 13:42 and shall cast them into a furnac of fire: there
shall be wail and gnash of teeth

13:43 then shall the righteou shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of their father who hath ear to hear let him hear

13:44 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasur hid in a
field; the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field

13:45 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man
seek goodli pearls: 13:46 who when he had found one pearl of great
price went and sold all that he had and bought it

13:47 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that wa cast
into the sea and gather of everi kind: 13:48 which when it wa
full they drew to shore and sat down and gather the good into
vessel but cast the bad away

13:49 so shall it be at the end of the world: the angel shall come
forth and sever the wick from among the just 13:50 and shall cast
them into the furnac of fire: there shall be wail and gnash of
teeth

13:51 jesu saith unto them have ye understood all these things? they
say unto him yea lord

13:52 then said he unto them therefor everi scribe which is
instruct unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
household which bringeth forth out of hi treasur thing new and
old

13:53 and it came to pass that when jesu had finish these
parabl he depart thenc

13:54 and when he wa come into hi own countri he taught them in
their synagogu insomuch that they were astonish and said whenc
hath thi man thi wisdom and these mighti works? 13:55 is not thi
the carpent son? is not hi mother call mary? and hi brethren
jame and jose and simon and judas? 13:56 and hi sister are
they not all with us? whenc then hath thi man all these things?
13:57 and they were offend in him but jesu said unto them a
prophet is not without honour save in hi own countri and in hi own
hous

13:58 and he did not mani mighti work there becaus of their
unbelief

14:1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesu 14:2
and said unto hi servant thi is john the baptist; he is risen from
the dead; and therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him

14:3 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in
prison for herodia sake hi brother philip wife

14:4 for john said unto him it is not law for thee to have her

14:5 and when he would have put him to death he fear the multitud
becaus they count him as a prophet

14:6 but when herod birthday wa kept the daughter of herodia
danc befor them and pleas herod

14:7 whereupon he promis with an oath to give her whatsoev she
would ask

14:8 and she be befor instruct of her mother said give me
here john baptist head in a charger

14:9 and the king wa sorry: nevertheless for the oath sake and
them which sat with him at meat he command it to be given her

14:10 and he sent and behead john in the prison

14:11 and hi head wa brought in a charger and given to the damsel:
and she brought it to her mother

14:12 and hi discipl came and took up the bodi and buri it and
went and told jesu

14:13 when jesu heard of it he depart thenc by ship into a desert
place apart: and when the peopl had heard thereof they follow him
on foot out of the citi

14:14 and jesu went forth and saw a great multitud and wa move
with compass toward them and he heal their sick

14:15 and when it wa even hi discipl came to him say thi
is a desert place and the time is now past; send the multitud away
that they may go into the villag and buy themselv victual

14:16 but jesu said unto them they need not depart; give ye them to
eat

14:17 and they say unto him we have here but five loav and two
fish

14:18 he said bring them hither to me

14:19 and he command the multitud to sit down on the grass and
took the five loav and the two fish and look up to heaven he
bless and brake and gave the loav to hi discipl and the
discipl to the multitud

14:20 and they did all eat and were filled: and they took up of the
fragment that remain twelv basket full

14:21 and they that had eaten were about five thousand men besid
women and children

14:22 and straightway jesu constrain hi discipl to get into a
ship and to go befor him unto the other side while he sent the
multitud away

14:23 and when he had sent the multitud away he went up into a
mountain apart to pray: and when the even wa come he wa there
alon

14:24 but the ship wa now in the midst of the sea toss with waves:
for the wind wa contrari

14:25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesu went unto them
walk on the sea

14:26 and when the discipl saw him walk on the sea they were
troubl say it is a spirit; and they cri out for fear

14:27 but straightway jesu spake unto them say be of good cheer;
it is i; be not afraid

14:28 and peter answer him and said lord if it be thou bid me
come unto thee on the water

14:29 and he said come and when peter wa come down out of the ship
he walk on the water to go to jesu

14:30 but when he saw the wind boister he wa afraid; and
begin to sink he cri say lord save me

14:31 and immedi jesu stretch forth hi hand and caught him
and said unto him o thou of littl faith wherefor didst thou doubt?
14:32 and when they were come into the ship the wind ceas

14:33 then they that were in the ship came and worship him say
of a truth thou art the son of god

14:34 and when they were gone over they came into the land of
gennesaret

14:35 and when the men of that place had knowledg of him they sent
out into all that countri round about and brought unto him all that
were diseased; 14:36 and besought him that they might onli touch the
hem of hi garment: and as mani as touch were made perfectli whole

15:1 then came to jesu scribe and pharise which were of
jerusalem say 15:2 whi do thi discipl transgress the tradit
of the elders? for they wash not their hand when they eat bread

15:3 but he answer and said unto them whi do ye also transgress the
command of god by your tradition? 15:4 for god command say
honour thi father and mother: and he that curseth father or mother
let him die the death

15:5 but ye say whosoev shall say to hi father or hi mother it
is a gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me; 15:6 and
honour not hi father or hi mother he shall be free thu have ye
made the command of god of none effect by your tradit

15:7 ye hypocrit well did esaia prophesi of you say 15:8 thi
peopl draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with
their lips; but their heart is far from me

15:9 but in vain they do worship me teach for doctrin the
command of men

15:10 and he call the multitud and said unto them hear and
understand: 15:11 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;
but that which cometh out of the mouth thi defileth a man

15:12 then came hi discipl and said unto him knowest thou that
the pharise were offend after they heard thi saying? 15:13 but
he answer and said everi plant which my heavenli father hath not
plant shall be root up

15:14 let them alone: they be blind leader of the blind and if the
blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch

15:15 then answer peter and said unto him declar unto us thi
parabl

15:16 and jesu said are ye also yet without understanding? 15:17 do
not ye yet understand that whatsoev entereth in at the mouth goeth
into the belli and is cast out into the draught? 15:18 but those
thing which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and
they defil the man

15:19 for out of the heart proceed evil thought murder adulteri
fornic theft fals wit blasphemies: 15:20 these are the
thing which defil a man: but to eat with unwashen hand defileth not
a man

15:21 then jesu went thenc and depart into the coast of tyre and
sidon

15:22 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and
cri unto him say have merci on me o lord thou son of david;
my daughter is grievous vex with a devil

15:23 but he answer her not a word and hi discipl came and
besought him say send her away; for she crieth after us

15:24 but he answer and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the hous of israel

15:25 then came she and worship him say lord help me

15:26 but he answer and said it is not meet to take the children
bread and to cast it to dog

15:27 and she said truth lord: yet the dog eat of the crumb which
fall from their master tabl

15:28 then jesu answer and said unto her o woman great is thi
faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter wa made
whole from that veri hour

15:29 and jesu depart from thenc and came nigh unto the sea of
galilee; and went up into a mountain and sat down there

15:30 and great multitud came unto him have with them those that
were lame blind dumb maim and mani other and cast them down at
jesu feet; and he heal them: 15:31 insomuch that the multitud
wonder when they saw the dumb to speak the maim to be whole the
lame to walk and the blind to see: and they glorifi the god of
israel

15:32 then jesu call hi discipl unto him and said i have
compass on the multitud becaus they continu with me now three
day and have noth to eat: and i will not send them away fast
lest they faint in the way

15:33 and hi discipl say unto him whenc should we have so much
bread in the wilder as to fill so great a multitude? 15:34 and
jesu saith unto them how mani loav have ye? and they said seven
and a few littl fish

15:35 and he command the multitud to sit down on the ground

15:36 and he took the seven loav and the fish and gave thank
and brake them and gave to hi discipl and the discipl to the
multitud

15:37 and they did all eat and were filled: and they took up of the
broken meat that wa left seven basket full

15:38 and they that did eat were four thousand men besid women and
children

15:39 and he sent away the multitud and took ship and came into the
coast of magdala

16:1 the pharise also with the sadduce came and tempt desir
him that he would shew them a sign from heaven

16:2 he answer and said unto them when it is even ye say it
will be fair weather: for the sky is red

16:3 and in the morn it will be foul weather to day: for the sky
is red and lower o ye hypocrit ye can discern the face of the
sky; but can ye not discern the sign of the times? 16:4 a wick and
adulter gener seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
given unto it but the sign of the prophet jona and he left them
and depart

16:5 and when hi discipl were come to the other side they had
forgotten to take bread

16:6 then jesu said unto them take heed and bewar of the leaven of
the pharise and of the sadduce

16:7 and they reason among themselv say it is becaus we have
taken no bread

16:8 which when jesu perceiv he said unto them o ye of littl
faith whi reason ye among yourselv becaus ye have brought no
bread? 16:9 do ye not yet understand neither rememb the five
loav of the five thousand and how mani basket ye took up? 16:10
neither the seven loav of the four thousand and how mani basket ye
took up? 16:11 how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it
not to you concern bread that ye should bewar of the leaven of
the pharise and of the sadducees? 16:12 then understood they how
that he bade them not bewar of the leaven of bread but of the
doctrin of the pharise and of the sadduce

16:13 when jesu came into the coast of caesarea philippi he ask
hi discipl say whom do men say that i the son of man am?
16:14 and they said some say that thou art john the baptist: some
elias; and other jeremia or one of the prophet

16:15 he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am? 16:16 and simon
peter answer and said thou art the christ the son of the live
god

16:17 and jesu answer and said unto him bless art thou simon
barjona: for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee but my
father which is in heaven

16:18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon thi
rock i will build my church; and the gate of hell shall not prevail
against it

16:19 and i will give unto thee the key of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatsoev thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
whatsoev thou shalt loos on earth shall be loos in heaven

16:20 then charg he hi discipl that they should tell no man that
he wa jesu the christ

16:21 from that time forth began jesu to shew unto hi discipl how
that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer mani thing of the elder
and chief priest and scribe and be kill and be rais again the
third day

16:22 then peter took him and began to rebuk him say be it far
from thee lord: thi shall not be unto thee

16:23 but he turn and said unto peter get thee behind me satan:
thou art an offenc unto me: for thou savourest not the thing that be
of god but those that be of men

16:24 then said jesu unto hi discipl if ani man will come after
me let him deni himself and take up hi cross and follow me

16:25 for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it: and whosoev
will lose hi life for my sake shall find it

16:26 for what is a man profit if he shall gain the whole world
and lose hi own soul? or what shall a man give in exchang for hi
soul? 16:27 for the son of man shall come in the glori of hi father
with hi angels; and then he shall reward everi man accord to hi
work

16:28 verili i say unto you there be some stand here which shall
not tast of death till they see the son of man come in hi
kingdom

17:1 and after six day jesu taketh peter jame and john hi
brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 17:2 and
wa transfigur befor them: and hi face did shine as the sun and
hi raiment wa white as the light

17:3 and behold there appear unto them mose and elia talk
with him

17:4 then answer peter and said unto jesu lord it is good for us
to be here: if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles; one for
thee and one for mose and one for elia

17:5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadow them: and
behold a voic out of the cloud which said thi is my belov son
in whom i am well pleased; hear ye him

17:6 and when the discipl heard it they fell on their face and
were sore afraid

17:7 and jesu came and touch them and said aris and be not
afraid

17:8 and when they had lift up their eye they saw no man save
jesu onli

17:9 and as they came down from the mountain jesu charg them
say tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again
from the dead

17:10 and hi discipl ask him say whi then say the scribe
that elia must first come? 17:11 and jesu answer and said unto
them elia truli shall first come and restor all thing

17:12 but i say unto you that elia is come alreadi and they knew
him not but have done unto him whatsoev they list likewis shall
also the son of man suffer of them

17:13 then the discipl understood that he spake unto them of john
the baptist

17:14 and when they were come to the multitud there came to him a
certain man kneel down to him and say 17:15 lord have merci
on my son: for he is lunatick and sore vexed: for ofttim he falleth
into the fire and oft into the water

17:16 and i brought him to thi discipl and they could not cure him

17:17 then jesu answer and said o faithless and pervers
gener how long shall i be with you? how long shall i suffer you?
bring him hither to me

17:18 and jesu rebuk the devil; and he depart out of him: and the
child wa cure from that veri hour

17:19 then came the discipl to jesu apart and said whi could not
we cast him out? 17:20 and jesu said unto them becaus of your
unbelief: for verili i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed ye shall say unto thi mountain remov henc to yonder
place; and it shall remove; and noth shall be imposs unto you

17:21 howbeit thi kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast

17:22 and while they abod in galile jesu said unto them the son
of man shall be betray into the hand of men: 17:23 and they shall
kill him and the third day he shall be rais again

and they were exceed sorri

17:24 and when they were come to capernaum they that receiv tribut
money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute?
17:25 he saith ye and when he wa come into the hous jesu
prevent him say what thinkest thou simon? of whom do the king
of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children or of
strangers? 17:26 peter saith unto him of stranger jesu saith unto
him then are the children free

17:27 notwithstand lest we should offend them go thou to the sea
and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when
thou hast open hi mouth thou shalt find a piec of money: that
take and give unto them for me and thee

18:1 at the same time came the discipl unto jesu say who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 18:2 and jesu call a littl
child unto him and set him in the midst of them 18:3 and said
verili i say unto you except ye be convert and becom as littl
children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven

18:4 whosoev therefor shall humbl himself as thi littl child
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven

18:5 and whoso shall receiv one such littl child in my name
receiveth me

18:6 but whoso shall offend one of these littl one which believ in
me it were better for him that a millston were hang about hi
neck and that he were drown in the depth of the sea

18:7 woe unto the world becaus of offences! for it must need be that
offenc come; but woe to that man by whom the offenc cometh! 18:8
wherefor if thi hand or thi foot offend thee cut them off and cast
them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maim rather than have two hand or two feet to be cast into
everlast fire

18:9 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather
than have two eye to be cast into hell fire

18:10 take heed that ye despis not one of these littl ones; for i
say unto you that in heaven their angel do alway behold the face of
my father which is in heaven

18:11 for the son of man is come to save that which wa lost

18:12 how think ye? if a man have an hundr sheep and one of them be
gone astray doth he not leav the nineti and nine and goeth into the
mountain and seeketh that which is gone astray? 18:13 and if so be
that he find it verili i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
sheep than of the nineti and nine which went not astray

18:14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven
that one of these littl one should perish

18:15 moreov if thi brother shall trespass against thee go and tell
him hi fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee thou
hast gain thi brother

18:16 but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two
more that in the mouth of two or three wit everi word may be
establish

18:17 and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church:
but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican

18:18 verili i say unto you whatsoev ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven: and whatsoev ye shall loos on earth shall be
loos in heaven

18:19 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agre on earth as
touch ani thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of
my father which is in heaven

18:20 for where two or three are gather togeth in my name there
am i in the midst of them

18:21 then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother
sin against me and i forgiv him? till seven times? 18:22 jesu
saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times: but until
seventi time seven

18:23 therefor is the kingdom of heaven liken unto a certain king
which would take account of hi servant

18:24 and when he had begun to reckon one wa brought unto him which
owe him ten thousand talent

18:25 but forasmuch as he had not to pay hi lord command him to be
sold and hi wife and children and all that he had and payment to
be made

18:26 the servant therefor fell down and worship him say
lord have patienc with me and i will pay thee all

18:27 then the lord of that servant wa move with compass and
loos him and forgav him the debt

18:28 but the same servant went out and found one of hi
fellowserv which owe him an hundr pence: and he laid hand on
him and took him by the throat say pay me that thou owest

18:29 and hi fellowserv fell down at hi feet and besought him
say have patienc with me and i will pay thee all

18:30 and he would not: but went and cast him into prison till he
should pay the debt

18:31 so when hi fellowserv saw what wa done they were veri
sorri and came and told unto their lord all that wa done

18:32 then hi lord after that he had call him said unto him o
thou wick servant i forgav thee all that debt becaus thou
desiredst me: 18:33 shouldest not thou also have had compass on thi
fellowserv even as i had piti on thee? 18:34 and hi lord wa
wroth and deliv him to the tormentor till he should pay all
that wa due unto him

18:35 so likewis shall my heavenli father do also unto you if ye
from your heart forgiv not everi one hi brother their trespass

19:1 and it came to pass that when jesu had finish these say
he depart from galile and came into the coast of judaea beyond
jordan; 19:2 and great multitud follow him; and he heal them
there

19:3 the pharise also came unto him tempt him and say unto
him is it law for a man to put away hi wife for everi cause?
19:4 and he answer and said unto them have ye not read that he
which made them at the begin made them male and femal 19:5 and
said for thi caus shall a man leav father and mother and shall
cleav to hi wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? 19:6 wherefor
they are no more twain but one flesh what therefor god hath join
togeth let not man put asund

19:7 they say unto him whi did mose then command to give a write
of divorc and to put her away? 19:8 he saith unto them mose
becaus of the hard of your heart suffer you to put away your
wives: but from the begin it wa not so

19:9 and i say unto you whosoev shall put away hi wife except it
be for fornic and shall marri anoth committeth adultery: and
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adulteri

19:10 hi discipl say unto him if the case of the man be so with
hi wife it is not good to marri

19:11 but he said unto them all men cannot receiv thi say save
they to whom it is given

19:12 for there are some eunuch which were so born from their
mother womb: and there are some eunuch which were made eunuch of
men: and there be eunuch which have made themselv eunuch for the
kingdom of heaven sake he that is abl to receiv it let him
receiv it

19:13 then were there brought unto him littl children that he should
put hi hand on them and pray: and the discipl rebuk them

19:14 but jesu said suffer littl children and forbid them not to
come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven

19:15 and he laid hi hand on them and depart thenc

19:16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good
thing shall i do that i may have etern life? 19:17 and he said
unto him whi callest thou me good? there is none good but one that
is god: but if thou wilt enter into life keep the command

19:18 he saith unto him which? jesu said thou shalt do no murder
thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not steal thou shalt not
bear fals wit 19:19 honour thi father and thi mother: and thou
shalt love thi neighbour as thyself

19:20 the young man saith unto him all these thing have i kept from
my youth up: what lack i yet? 19:21 jesu said unto him if thou wilt
be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou
shalt have treasur in heaven: and come and follow me

19:22 but when the young man heard that say he went away
sorrowful: for he had great possess

19:23 then said jesu unto hi discipl verili i say unto you that
a rich man shall hardli enter into the kingdom of heaven

19:24 and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needl than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
god

19:25 when hi discipl heard it they were exceedingli amaz
say who then can be saved? 19:26 but jesu beheld them and said
unto them with men thi is impossible; but with god all thing are
possibl

19:27 then answer peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken
all and follow thee; what shall we have therefore? 19:28 and jesu
said unto them verili i say unto you that ye which have follow me
in the regener when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi
glori ye also shall sit upon twelv throne judg the twelv
tribe of israel

19:29 and everi one that hath forsaken hous or brethren or
sister or father or mother or wife or children or land for my
name sake shall receiv an hundredfold and shall inherit
everlast life

19:30 but mani that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
first

20:1 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
household which went out earli in the morn to hire labour
into hi vineyard

20:2 and when he had agre with the labour for a penni a day he
sent them into hi vineyard

20:3 and he went out about the third hour and saw other stand
idl in the marketplac 20:4 and said unto them; go ye also into the
vineyard and whatsoev is right i will give you and they went their
way

20:5 again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did
likewis

20:6 and about the eleventh hour he went out and found other
stand idl and saith unto them whi stand ye here all the day
idle? 20:7 they say unto him becaus no man hath hire us he saith
unto them go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoev is right that
shall ye receiv

20:8 so when even wa come the lord of the vineyard saith unto hi
steward call the labour and give them their hire begin from
the last unto the first

20:9 and when they came that were hire about the eleventh hour they
receiv everi man a penni

20:10 but when the first came they suppos that they should have
receiv more; and they likewis receiv everi man a penni

20:11 and when they had receiv it they murmur against the goodman
of the hous 20:12 say these last have wrought but one hour and
thou hast made them equal unto us which have born the burden and
heat of the day

20:13 but he answer one of them and said friend i do thee no
wrong: didst not thou agre with me for a penny? 20:14 take that
thine is and go thi way: i will give unto thi last even as unto
thee

20:15 is it not law for me to do what i will with mine own? is
thine eye evil becaus i am good? 20:16 so the last shall be first
and the first last: for mani be call but few chosen

20:17 and jesu go up to jerusalem took the twelv discipl apart
in the way and said unto them 20:18 behold we go up to jerusalem;
and the son of man shall be betray unto the chief priest and unto
the scribe and they shall condemn him to death 20:19 and shall
deliv him to the gentil to mock and to scourg and to crucifi
him: and the third day he shall rise again

20:20 then came to him the mother of zebede children with her son
worship him and desir a certain thing of him

20:21 and he said unto her what wilt thou? she saith unto him grant
that these my two son may sit the one on thi right hand and the
other on the left in thi kingdom

20:22 but jesu answer and said ye know not what ye ask are ye
abl to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptiz
with the baptism that i am baptiz with? they say unto him we are
abl

20:23 and he saith unto them ye shall drink inde of my cup and be
baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with: but to sit on my
right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepar of my father

20:24 and when the ten heard it they were move with indign
against the two brethren

20:25 but jesu call them unto him and said ye know that the
princ of the gentil exercis dominion over them and they that are
great exercis author upon them

20:26 but it shall not be so among you: but whosoev will be great
among you let him be your minister; 20:27 and whosoev will be chief
among you let him be your servant: 20:28 even as the son of man came
not to be minist unto but to minist and to give hi life a
ransom for mani

20:29 and as they depart from jericho a great multitud follow
him

20:30 and behold two blind men sit by the way side when they
heard that jesu pass by cri out say have merci on us o
lord thou son of david

20:31 and the multitud rebuk them becaus they should hold their
peace: but they cri the more say have merci on us o lord thou
son of david

20:32 and jesu stood still and call them and said what will ye
that i shall do unto you? 20:33 they say unto him lord that our
eye may be open

20:34 so jesu had compass on them and touch their eyes: and
immedi their eye receiv sight and they follow him

21:1 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to
bethphag unto the mount of oliv then sent jesu two discipl
21:2 say unto them go into the villag over against you and
straightway ye shall find an ass tie and a colt with her: loos
them and bring them unto me

21:3 and if ani man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath
need of them; and straightway he will send them

21:4 all thi wa done that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by
the prophet say 21:5 tell ye the daughter of sion behold thi
king cometh unto thee meek and sit upon an ass and a colt the
foal of an ass

21:6 and the discipl went and did as jesu command them 21:7 and
brought the ass and the colt and put on them their cloth and they
set him thereon

21:8 and a veri great multitud spread their garment in the way;
other cut down branch from the tree and straw them in the way

21:9 and the multitud that went befor and that follow cri
say hosanna to the son of david: bless is he that cometh in the
name of the lord; hosanna in the highest

21:10 and when he wa come into jerusalem all the citi wa move
say who is this? 21:11 and the multitud said thi is jesu the
prophet of nazareth of galile

21:12 and jesu went into the templ of god and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the templ and overthrew the tabl of the
moneychang and the seat of them that sold dove 21:13 and said
unto them it is written my hous shall be call the hous of
prayer; but ye have made it a den of thiev

21:14 and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
heal them

21:15 and when the chief priest and scribe saw the wonder thing
that he did and the children cri in the templ and say
hosanna to the son of david; they were sore displeas 21:16 and said
unto him hearest thou what these say? and jesu saith unto them yea;
have ye never read out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou hast
perfect praise? 21:17 and he left them and went out of the citi
into bethany; and he lodg there

21:18 now in the morn as he return into the citi he hunger

21:19 and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found
noth thereon but leav onli and said unto it let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever and present the fig tree wither
away

21:20 and when the discipl saw it they marvel say how soon
is the fig tree wither away! 21:21 jesu answer and said unto
them verili i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall
not onli do thi which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall
say unto thi mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the
sea; it shall be done

21:22 and all thing whatsoev ye shall ask in prayer believ ye
shall receiv

21:23 and when he wa come into the templ the chief priest and the
elder of the peopl came unto him as he wa teach and said by
what author doest thou these things? and who gave thee thi
authority? 21:24 and jesu answer and said unto them i also will
ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you
by what author i do these thing

21:25 the baptism of john whenc wa it? from heaven or of men? and
they reason with themselv say if we shall say from heaven;
he will say unto us whi did ye not then believ him? 21:26 but if we
shall say of men; we fear the people; for all hold john as a prophet

21:27 and they answer jesu and said we cannot tell and he said
unto them neither tell i you by what author i do these thing

21:28 but what think ye? a certain man had two sons; and he came to
the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard

21:29 he answer and said i will not: but afterward he repent and
went

21:30 and he came to the second and said likewis and he answer
and said i go sir: and went not

21:31 whether of them twain did the will of hi father? they say unto
him the first jesu saith unto them verili i say unto you that the
publican and the harlot go into the kingdom of god befor you

21:32 for john came unto you in the way of righteous and ye
believ him not: but the publican and the harlot believ him: and
ye when ye had seen it repent not afterward that ye might believ
him

21:33 hear anoth parable: there wa a certain household which
plant a vineyard and hedg it round about and dig a winepress
in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into
a far country: 21:34 and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent
hi servant to the husbandmen that they might receiv the fruit of
it

21:35 and the husbandmen took hi servant and beat one and kill
anoth and stone anoth

21:36 again he sent other servant more than the first: and they did
unto them likewis

21:37 but last of all he sent unto them hi son say they will
rever my son

21:38 but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselv
thi is the heir; come let us kill him and let us seiz on hi
inherit

21:39 and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew
him

21:40 when the lord therefor of the vineyard cometh what will he do
unto those husbandmen? 21:41 they say unto him he will miser
destroy those wick men and will let out hi vineyard unto other
husbandmen which shall render him the fruit in their season

21:42 jesu saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptur the
stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of the
corner: thi is the lord do and it is marvel in our eyes?
21:43 therefor say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from
you and given to a nation bring forth the fruit thereof

21:44 and whosoev shall fall on thi stone shall be broken: but on
whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder

21:45 and when the chief priest and pharise had heard hi parabl
they perceiv that he spake of them

21:46 but when they sought to lay hand on him they fear the
multitud becaus they took him for a prophet

22:1 and jesu answer and spake unto them again by parabl and
said 22:2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which
made a marriag for hi son 22:3 and sent forth hi servant to call
them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come

22:4 again he sent forth other servant say tell them which are
bidden behold i have prepar my dinner: my oxen and my fatl are
kill and all thing are ready: come unto the marriag

22:5 but they made light of it and went their way one to hi farm
anoth to hi merchandise: 22:6 and the remnant took hi servant
and entreat them spite and slew them

22:7 but when the king heard thereof he wa wroth: and he sent forth
hi armi and destroy those murder and burn up their citi

22:8 then saith he to hi servant the wed is readi but they
which were bidden were not worthi

22:9 go ye therefor into the highway and as mani as ye shall find
bid to the marriag

22:10 so those servant went out into the highway and gather
togeth all as mani as they found both bad and good: and the wed
wa furnish with guest

22:11 and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man
which had not on a wed garment: 22:12 and he saith unto him
friend how camest thou in hither not have a wed garment? and he
wa speechless

22:13 then said the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and
take him away and cast him into outer dark there shall be
weep and gnash of teeth

22:14 for mani are call but few are chosen

22:15 then went the pharise and took counsel how they might
entangl him in hi talk

22:16 and they sent out unto him their discipl with the herodian
say master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of
god in truth neither carest thou for ani man: for thou regardest not
the person of men

22:17 tell us therefor what thinkest thou? is it law to give
tribut unto caesar or not? 22:18 but jesu perceiv their
wicked and said whi tempt ye me ye hypocrites? 22:19 shew me
the tribut money and they brought unto him a penni

22:20 and he saith unto them whose is thi imag and superscription?
22:21 they say unto him caesar then saith he unto them render
therefor unto caesar the thing which are caesars; and unto god the
thing that are god

22:22 when they had heard these word they marvel and left him
and went their way

22:23 the same day came to him the sadduce which say that there is
no resurrect and ask him 22:24 say master mose said if a
man die have no children hi brother shall marri hi wife and
rais up seed unto hi brother

22:25 now there were with us seven brethren: and the first when he
had marri a wife deceas and have no issu left hi wife unto
hi brother: 22:26 likewis the second also and the third unto the
seventh

22:27 and last of all the woman die also

22:28 therefor in the resurrect whose wife shall she be of the
seven? for they all had her

22:29 jesu answer and said unto them ye do err not know the
scriptur nor the power of god

22:30 for in the resurrect they neither marri nor are given in
marriag but are as the angel of god in heaven

22:31 but as touch the resurrect of the dead have ye not read
that which wa spoken unto you by god say 22:32 i am the god of
abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob? god is not the
god of the dead but of the live

22:33 and when the multitud heard thi they were astonish at hi
doctrin

22:34 but when the pharise had heard that he had put the sadduce
to silenc they were gather togeth

22:35 then one of them which wa a lawyer ask him a question
tempt him and say 22:36 master which is the great command
in the law? 22:37 jesu said unto him thou shalt love the lord thi
god with all thi heart and with all thi soul and with all thi mind

22:38 thi is the first and great command

22:39 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thi neighbour as
thyself

22:40 on these two command hang all the law and the prophet

22:41 while the pharise were gather togeth jesu ask them
22:42 say what think ye of christ? whose son is he? they say unto
him the son of david

22:43 he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord
say 22:44 the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
till i make thine enemi thi footstool? 22:45 if david then call him
lord how is he hi son? 22:46 and no man wa abl to answer him a
word neither durst ani man from that day forth ask him ani more
question

23:1 then spake jesu to the multitud and to hi discipl 23:2
say the scribe and the pharise sit in mose seat: 23:3 all
therefor whatsoev they bid you observ that observ and do; but do
not ye after their works: for they say and do not

23:4 for they bind heavi burden and grievou to be born and lay
them on men shoulders; but they themselv will not move them with
one of their finger

23:5 but all their work they do for to be seen of men: they make
broad their phylacteri and enlarg the border of their garment
23:6 and love the uppermost room at feast and the chief seat in
the synagogu 23:7 and greet in the market and to be call of
men rabbi rabbi

23:8 but be not ye call rabbi: for one is your master even christ;
and all ye are brethren

23:9 and call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
father which is in heaven

23:10 neither be ye call masters: for one is your master even
christ

23:11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant

23:12 and whosoev shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
shall humbl himself shall be exalt

23:13 but woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselv
neither suffer ye them that are enter to go in

23:14 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye devour
widow hous and for a pretenc make long prayer: therefor ye
shall receiv the greater damnat

23:15 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyt and when he is made ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselv

23:16 woe unto you ye blind guid which say whosoev shall swear
by the templ it is nothing; but whosoev shall swear by the gold of
the templ he is a debtor! 23:17 ye fool and blind: for whether is
greater the gold or the templ that sanctifieth the gold? 23:18
and whosoev shall swear by the altar it is nothing; but whosoev
sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilti

23:19 ye fool and blind: for whether is greater the gift or the
altar that sanctifieth the gift? 23:20 whoso therefor shall swear by
the altar sweareth by it and by all thing thereon

23:21 and whoso shall swear by the templ sweareth by it and by him
that dwelleth therein

23:22 and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of
god and by him that sitteth thereon

23:23 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye pay
tith of mint and anis and cummin and have omit the weightier
matter of the law judgment merci and faith: these ought ye to have
done and not to leav the other undon

23:24 ye blind guid which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel

23:25 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye make
clean the outsid of the cup and of the platter but within they are
full of extort and excess

23:26 thou blind pharise cleans first that which is within the cup
and platter that the outsid of them may be clean also

23:27 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye are like
unto white sepulchr which inde appear beauti outward but are
within full of dead men bone and of all unclean

23:28 even so ye also outwardli appear righteou unto men but within
ye are full of hypocrisi and iniqu

23:29 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! becaus ye
build the tomb of the prophet and garnish the sepulchr of the
righteou 23:30 and say if we had been in the day of our father
we would not have been partak with them in the blood of the
prophet

23:31 wherefor ye be wit unto yourselv that ye are the
children of them which kill the prophet

23:32 fill ye up then the measur of your father

23:33 ye serpent ye gener of viper how can ye escap the
damnat of hell? 23:34 wherefor behold i send unto you prophet
and wise men and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;
and some of them shall ye scourg in your synagogu and persecut
them from citi to city: 23:35 that upon you may come all the righteou
blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteou abel unto the
blood of zacharia son of barachia whom ye slew between the templ
and the altar

23:36 verili i say unto you all these thing shall come upon thi
gener

23:37 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophet and
stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gather
thi children togeth even as a hen gathereth her chicken under her
wing and ye would not! 23:38 behold your hous is left unto you
desol

23:39 for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye
shall say bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord

24:1 and jesu went out and depart from the temple: and hi
discipl came to him for to shew him the build of the templ

24:2 and jesu said unto them see ye not all these things? verili i
say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon anoth
that shall not be thrown down

24:3 and as he sat upon the mount of oliv the discipl came unto
him privat say tell us when shall these thing be? and what
shall be the sign of thi come and of the end of the world? 24:4
and jesu answer and said unto them take heed that no man deceiv
you

24:5 for mani shall come in my name say i am christ; and shall
deceiv mani

24:6 and ye shall hear of war and rumour of wars: see that ye be not
troubled: for all these thing must come to pass but the end is not
yet

24:7 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom: and there shall be famin and pestil and earthquak
in diver place

24:8 all these are the begin of sorrow

24:9 then shall they deliv you up to be afflict and shall kill
you: and ye shall be hate of all nation for my name sake

24:10 and then shall mani be offend and shall betray one anoth
and shall hate one anoth

24:11 and mani fals prophet shall rise and shall deceiv mani

24:12 and becaus iniqu shall abound the love of mani shall wax
cold

24:13 but he that shall endur unto the end the same shall be save

24:14 and thi gospel of the kingdom shall be preach in all the
world for a wit unto all nations; and then shall the end come

24:15 when ye therefor shall see the abomin of desol
spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holi place (whoso
readeth let him understand:) 24:16 then let them which be in judaea
flee into the mountains: 24:17 let him which is on the housetop not
come down to take ani thing out of hi house: 24:18 neither let him
which is in the field return back to take hi cloth

24:19 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give
suck in those days! 24:20 but pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter neither on the sabbath day: 24:21 for then shall be great
tribul such as wa not sinc the begin of the world to thi
time no nor ever shall be

24:22 and except those day should be shorten there should no flesh
be saved: but for the elect sake those day shall be shorten

24:23 then if ani man shall say unto you lo here is christ or
there; believ it not

24:24 for there shall aris fals christ and fals prophet and
shall shew great sign and wonders; insomuch that if it were
possibl they shall deceiv the veri elect

24:25 behold i have told you befor

24:26 wherefor if they shall say unto you behold he is in the
desert; go not forth: behold he is in the secret chambers; believ it
not

24:27 for as the lightn cometh out of the east and shineth even
unto the west; so shall also the come of the son of man be

24:28 for wheresoev the carcas is there will the eagl be
gather togeth

24:29 immedi after the tribul of those day shall the sun be
darken and the moon shall not give her light and the star shall
fall from heaven and the power of the heaven shall be shaken: 24:30
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven: and then
shall all the tribe of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of
man come in the cloud of heaven with power and great glori

24:31 and he shall send hi angel with a great sound of a trumpet
and they shall gather togeth hi elect from the four wind from one
end of heaven to the other

24:32 now learn a parabl of the fig tree; when hi branch is yet
tender and putteth forth leav ye know that summer is nigh: 24:33
so likewis ye when ye shall see all these thing know that it is
near even at the door

24:34 verili i say unto you thi gener shall not pass till all
these thing be fulfil

24:35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass
away

24:36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angel of
heaven but my father onli

24:37 but as the day of noe were so shall also the come of the son
of man be

24:38 for as in the day that were befor the flood they were eat
and drink marri and give in marriag until the day that noe
enter into the ark 24:39 and knew not until the flood came and
took them all away; so shall also the come of the son of man be

24:40 then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken and the
other left

24:41 two women shall be grind at the mill; the one shall be taken
and the other left

24:42 watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your lord doth come

24:43 but know thi that if the goodman of the hous had known in
what watch the thief would come he would have watch and would not
have suffer hi hous to be broken up

24:44 therefor be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
the son of man cometh

24:45 who then is a faith and wise servant whom hi lord hath made
ruler over hi household to give them meat in due season? 24:46
bless is that servant whom hi lord when he cometh shall find so
do

24:47 verili i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all hi
good

24:48 but and if that evil servant shall say in hi heart my lord
delayeth hi coming; 24:49 and shall begin to smite hi
fellowserv and to eat and drink with the drunken; 24:50 the lord
of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and
in an hour that he is not awar of 24:51 and shall cut him asund
and appoint him hi portion with the hypocrites: there shall be
weep and gnash of teeth

25:1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be liken unto ten virgin
which took their lamp and went forth to meet the bridegroom

25:2 and five of them were wise and five were foolish

25:3 they that were foolish took their lamp and took no oil with
them: 25:4 but the wise took oil in their vessel with their lamp

25:5 while the bridegroom tarri they all slumber and slept

25:6 and at midnight there wa a cri made behold the bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him

25:7 then all those virgin aros and trim their lamp

25:8 and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil; for our
lamp are gone out

25:9 but the wise answer say not so; lest there be not enough
for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for
yourselv

25:10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came; and they that
were readi went in with him to the marriage: and the door wa shut

25:11 afterward came also the other virgin say lord lord open
to us

25:12 but he answer and said verili i say unto you i know you not

25:13 watch therefor for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the son of man cometh

25:14 for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travel into a far
countri who call hi own servant and deliv unto them hi
good

25:15 and unto one he gave five talent to anoth two and to
anoth one; to everi man accord to hi sever ability; and
straightway took hi journey

25:16 then he that had receiv the five talent went and trade with
the same and made them other five talent

25:17 and likewis he that had receiv two he also gain other two

25:18 but he that had receiv one went and dig in the earth and
hid hi lord money

25:19 after a long time the lord of those servant cometh and
reckoneth with them

25:20 and so he that had receiv five talent came and brought other
five talent say lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents:
behold i have gain besid them five talent more

25:21 hi lord said unto him well done thou good and faith
servant: thou hast been faith over a few thing i will make thee
ruler over mani things: enter thou into the joy of thi lord

25:22 he also that had receiv two talent came and said lord thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold i have gain two other
talent besid them

25:23 hi lord said unto him well done good and faith servant;
thou hast been faith over a few thing i will make thee ruler over
mani things: enter thou into the joy of thi lord

25:24 then he which had receiv the one talent came and said lord i
knew thee that thou art an hard man reap where thou hast not sown
and gather where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 and i wa afraid and
went and hid thi talent in the earth: lo there thou hast that is
thine

25:26 hi lord answer and said unto him thou wick and sloth
servant thou knewest that i reap where i sow not and gather where
i have not strawed: 25:27 thou oughtest therefor to have put my money
to the exchang and then at my come i should have receiv mine
own with usuri

25:28 take therefor the talent from him and give it unto him which
hath ten talent

25:29 for unto everi one that hath shall be given and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath

25:30 and cast ye the unprofit servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weep and gnash of teeth

25:31 when the son of man shall come in hi glori and all the holi
angel with him then shall he sit upon the throne of hi glory: 25:32
and befor him shall be gather all nations: and he shall separ
them one from anoth as a shepherd divideth hi sheep from the
goats: 25:33 and he shall set the sheep on hi right hand but the
goat on the left

25:34 then shall the king say unto them on hi right hand come ye
bless of my father inherit the kingdom prepar for you from the
foundat of the world: 25:35 for i wa an hungr and ye gave me
meat: i wa thirsti and ye gave me drink: i wa a stranger and ye
took me in: 25:36 nake and ye cloth me: i wa sick and ye visit
me: i wa in prison and ye came unto me

25:37 then shall the righteou answer him say lord when saw we
thee an hungr and fed thee? or thirsti and gave thee drink? 25:38
when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in? or nake and cloth
thee? 25:39 or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto
thee? 25:40 and the king shall answer and say unto them verili i say
unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren ye have done it unto me

25:41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from
me ye curs into everlast fire prepar for the devil and hi
angels: 25:42 for i wa an hungr and ye gave me no meat: i wa
thirsti and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 i wa a stranger and ye took
me not in: nake and ye cloth me not: sick and in prison and ye
visit me not

25:44 then shall they also answer him say lord when saw we thee
an hungr or athirst or a stranger or nake or sick or in
prison and did not minist unto thee? 25:45 then shall he answer
them say verili i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of these ye did it not to me

25:46 and these shall go away into everlast punishment: but the
righteou into life etern

26:1 and it came to pass when jesu had finish all these say
he said unto hi discipl 26:2 ye know that after two day is the
feast of the passov and the son of man is betray to be crucifi

26:3 then assembl togeth the chief priest and the scribe and
the elder of the peopl unto the palac of the high priest who wa
call caiapha 26:4 and consult that they might take jesu by
subtilti and kill him

26:5 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar
among the peopl

26:6 now when jesu wa in bethani in the hous of simon the leper
26:7 there came unto him a woman have an alabast box of veri
preciou ointment and pour it on hi head as he sat at meat

26:8 but when hi discipl saw it they had indign say to
what purpos is thi waste? 26:9 for thi ointment might have been
sold for much and given to the poor

26:10 when jesu understood it he said unto them whi troubl ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me

26:11 for ye have the poor alway with you; but me ye have not alway

26:12 for in that she hath pour thi ointment on my bodi she did it
for my burial

26:13 verili i say unto you wheresoev thi gospel shall be preach
in the whole world there shall also thi that thi woman hath done
be told for a memori of her

26:14 then one of the twelv call juda iscariot went unto the
chief priest 26:15 and said unto them what will ye give me and i
will deliv him unto you? and they coven with him for thirti
piec of silver

26:16 and from that time he sought opportun to betray him

26:17 now the first day of the feast of unleaven bread the discipl
came to jesu say unto him where wilt thou that we prepar for
thee to eat the passover? 26:18 and he said go into the citi to such
a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand; i will
keep the passov at thi hous with my discipl

26:19 and the discipl did as jesu had appoint them; and they made
readi the passov

26:20 now when the even wa come he sat down with the twelv

26:21 and as they did eat he said verili i say unto you that one of
you shall betray me

26:22 and they were exceed sorrow and began everi one of them
to say unto him lord is it i? 26:23 and he answer and said he
that dippeth hi hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me

26:24 the son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
man by whom the son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man
if he had not been born

26:25 then juda which betray him answer and said master is it
i? he said unto him thou hast said

26:26 and as they were eat jesu took bread and bless it and
brake it and gave it to the discipl and said take eat; thi is
my bodi

26:27 and he took the cup and gave thank and gave it to them
say drink ye all of it; 26:28 for thi is my blood of the new
testament which is shed for mani for the remiss of sin

26:29 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of thi fruit of
the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father
kingdom

26:30 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
oliv

26:31 then saith jesu unto them all ye shall be offend becaus of
me thi night: for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the
sheep of the flock shall be scatter abroad

26:32 but after i am risen again i will go befor you into galile

26:33 peter answer and said unto him though all men shall be
offend becaus of thee yet will i never be offend

26:34 jesu said unto him verili i say unto thee that thi night
befor the cock crow thou shalt deni me thrice

26:35 peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i
not deni thee likewis also said all the discipl

26:36 then cometh jesu with them unto a place call gethseman and
saith unto the discipl sit ye here while i go and pray yonder

26:37 and he took with him peter and the two son of zebede and
began to be sorrow and veri heavi

26:38 then saith he unto them my soul is exceed sorrow even
unto death: tarri ye here and watch with me

26:39 and he went a littl farther and fell on hi face and pray
say o my father if it be possibl let thi cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt

26:40 and he cometh unto the discipl and findeth them asleep and
saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour? 26:41
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit inde
is will but the flesh is weak

26:42 he went away again the second time and pray say o my
father if thi cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thi
will be done

26:43 and he came and found them asleep again: for their eye were
heavi

26:44 and he left them and went away again and pray the third
time say the same word

26:45 then cometh he to hi discipl and saith unto them sleep on
now and take your rest: behold the hour is at hand and the son of
man is betray into the hand of sinner

26:46 rise let us be going: behold he is at hand that doth betray
me

26:47 and while he yet spake lo juda one of the twelv came and
with him a great multitud with sword and stave from the chief
priest and elder of the peopl

26:48 now he that betray him gave them a sign say whomsoev i
shall kiss that same is he: hold him fast

26:49 and forthwith he came to jesu and said hail master; and
kiss him

26:50 and jesu said unto him friend wherefor art thou come? then
came they and laid hand on jesu and took him

26:51 and behold one of them which were with jesu stretch out hi
hand and drew hi sword and struck a servant of the high priest
and smote off hi ear

26:52 then said jesu unto him put up again thi sword into hi place:
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword

26:53 thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall
present give me more than twelv legion of angels? 26:54 but how
then shall the scriptur be fulfil that thu it must be? 26:55
in that same hour said jesu to the multitud are ye come out as
against a thief with sword and stave for to take me? i sat daili
with you teach in the templ and ye laid no hold on me

26:56 but all thi wa done that the scriptur of the prophet might
be fulfil then all the discipl forsook him and fled

26:57 and they that had laid hold on jesu led him away to caiapha
the high priest where the scribe and the elder were assembl

26:58 but peter follow him afar off unto the high priest palac
and went in and sat with the servant to see the end

26:59 now the chief priest and elder and all the council sought
fals wit against jesu to put him to death; 26:60 but found
none: yea though mani fals wit came yet found they none at
the last came two fals wit 26:61 and said thi fellow said i
am abl to destroy the templ of god and to build it in three day

26:62 and the high priest aros and said unto him answerest thou
nothing? what is it which these wit against thee? 26:63 but jesu
held hi peac and the high priest answer and said unto him i
adjur thee by the live god that thou tell us whether thou be the
christ the son of god

26:64 jesu saith unto him thou hast said: nevertheless i say unto
you hereaft shall ye see the son of man sit on the right hand
of power and come in the cloud of heaven

26:65 then the high priest rent hi cloth say he hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold now ye have
heard hi blasphemi

26:66 what think ye? they answer and said he is guilti of death

26:67 then did they spit in hi face and buffet him; and other
smote him with the palm of their hand 26:68 say prophesi unto
us thou christ who is he that smote thee? 26:69 now peter sat
without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him say thou also
wast with jesu of galile

26:70 but he deni befor them all say i know not what thou
sayest

26:71 and when he wa gone out into the porch anoth maid saw him
and said unto them that were there thi fellow wa also with jesu of
nazareth

26:72 and again he deni with an oath i do not know the man

26:73 and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to
peter sure thou also art one of them; for thi speech bewrayeth
thee

26:74 then began he to curs and to swear say i know not the man
and immedi the cock crew

26:75 and peter rememb the word of jesu which said unto him
befor the cock crow thou shalt deni me thrice and he went out and
wept bitterli

27:1 when the morn wa come all the chief priest and elder of
the peopl took counsel against jesu to put him to death: 27:2 and
when they had bound him they led him away and deliv him to
pontiu pilat the governor

27:3 then juda which had betray him when he saw that he wa
condemn repent himself and brought again the thirti piec of
silver to the chief priest and elder 27:4 say i have sin in
that i have betray the innoc blood and they said what is that
to us? see thou to that

27:5 and he cast down the piec of silver in the templ and
depart and went and hang himself

27:6 and the chief priest took the silver piec and said it is not

27:27 then the soldier of the governor took jesu into the common
hall and gather unto him the whole band of soldier

27:28 and they strip him and put on him a scarlet robe

27:29 and when they had plat a crown of thorn they put it upon
hi head and a reed in hi right hand: and they bow the knee befor
him and mock him say hail king of the jews! 27:30 and they
spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head

27:31 and after that they had mock him they took the robe off from

27:32 and as they came out they found a man of cyren simon by name:

27:41 likewis also the chief priest mock him with the scribe
and elder said 27:42 he save others; himself he cannot save if he
be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we
will believ him

27:43 he trust in god; let him deliv him now if he will have him:
for he said i am the son of god

27:44 the thiev also which were crucifi with him cast the same

27:45 now from the sixth hour there wa dark over all the land
unto the ninth hour

27:46 and about the ninth hour jesu cri with a loud voic say

thou forsaken me? 27:47 some of them that stood there when they
heard that said thi man calleth for elia

27:48 and straightway one of them ran and took a spung and fill

27:50 jesu when he had cri again with a loud voic yield up the

27:57 when the even wa come there came a rich man of arimathaea
name joseph who also himself wa jesu disciple: 27:58 he went to
pilat and beg the bodi of jesu then pilat command the bodi
to be deliv

27:59 and when joseph had taken the bodi he wrap it in a clean
linen cloth 27:60 and laid it in hi own new tomb which he had hewn
out in the rock: and he roll a great stone to the door of the
sepulchr and depart

27:61 and there wa mari magdalen and the other mari sit over

27:62 now the next day that follow the day of the prepar the
chief priest and pharise came togeth unto pilat 27:63 say
sir we rememb that that deceiv said while he wa yet aliv
after three day i will rise again

27:64 command therefor that the sepulchr be made sure until the

27:65 pilat said unto them ye have a watch: go your way make it as

27:66 so they went and made the sepulchr sure seal the stone
and set a watch

28:1 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week came mari magdalen and the other mari to see the

28:2 and behold there wa a great earthquake: for the angel of the
lord descend from heaven and came and roll back the stone from

28:6 he is not here: for he is risen as he said come see the place
where the lord lay

28:7 and go quickli and tell hi discipl that he is risen from the
dead; and behold he goeth befor you into galilee; there shall ye

joy; and did run to bring hi discipl word

28:9 and as they went to tell hi discipl behold jesu met them
say all hail and they came and held him by the feet and
worship him

28:10 then said jesu unto them be not afraid: go tell my brethren
that they go into galile and there shall they see me

28:11 now when they were go behold some of the watch came into
the citi and shew unto the chief priest all the thing that were

28:12 and when they were assembl with the elder and had taken
counsel they gave larg money unto the soldier 28:13 say say

28:14 and if thi come to the governor ear we will persuad him
and secur you

28:15 so they took the money and did as they were taught: and thi
say is commonli report among the jew until thi day

28:16 then the eleven discipl went away into galile into a
mountain where jesu had appoint them

28:17 and when they saw him they worship him: but some doubt

28:18 and jesu came and spake unto them say all power is given

28:19 go ye therefor and teach all nation baptiz them in the
name of the father and of the son and of the holi ghost: 28:20
teach them to observ all thing whatsoev i have command you:
and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen




the gospel accord to saint mark


1:1 the begin of the gospel of jesu christ the son of god; 1:2
as it is written in the prophet behold i send my messeng befor
thi face which shall prepar thi way befor thee

1:3 the voic of one cri in the wilder prepar ye the way of
the lord make hi path straight

1:4 john did baptiz in the wilder and preach the baptism of
repent for the remiss of sin

1:5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of
jerusalem and were all baptiz of him in the river of jordan
confess their sin

1:6 and john wa cloth with camel hair and with a girdl of a
skin about hi loins; and he did eat locust and wild honey; 1:7 and
preach say there cometh one mightier than i after me the
latchet of whose shoe i am not worthi to stoop down and unloos

1:8 i inde have baptiz you with water: but he shall baptiz you
with the holi ghost

1:9 and it came to pass in those day that jesu came from nazareth
of galile and wa baptiz of john in jordan

1:10 and straightway come up out of the water he saw the heaven
open and the spirit like a dove descend upon him: 1:11 and there
came a voic from heaven say thou art my belov son in whom i
am well pleas

1:12 and immedi the spirit driveth him into the wilder

1:13 and he wa there in the wilder forti day tempt of satan;
and wa with the wild beasts; and the angel minist unto him

1:14 now after that john wa put in prison jesu came into galile
preach the gospel of the kingdom of god 1:15 and say the time
is fulfil and the kingdom of god is at hand: repent ye and
believ the gospel

1:16 now as he walk by the sea of galile he saw simon and andrew
hi brother cast a net into the sea: for they were fisher

1:17 and jesu said unto them come ye after me and i will make you
to becom fisher of men

1:18 and straightway they forsook their net and follow him

1:19 and when he had gone a littl farther thenc he saw jame the
son of zebede and john hi brother who also were in the ship
mend their net

1:20 and straightway he call them: and they left their father
zebede in the ship with the hire servant and went after him

1:21 and they went into capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day
he enter into the synagogu and taught

1:22 and they were astonish at hi doctrine: for he taught them as
one that had author and not as the scribe

1:23 and there wa in their synagogu a man with an unclean spirit;
and he cri out 1:24 say let us alone; what have we to do with
thee thou jesu of nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? i know thee
who thou art the holi one of god

1:25 and jesu rebuk him say hold thi peac and come out of
him

1:26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cri with a loud
voic he came out of him

1:27 and they were all amaz insomuch that they question among
themselv say what thing is this? what new doctrin is this? for
with author commandeth he even the unclean spirit and they do
obey him

1:28 and immedi hi fame spread abroad throughout all the region
round about galile

1:29 and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogu they
enter into the hous of simon and andrew with jame and john

1:30 but simon wife mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell
him of her

1:31 and he came and took her by the hand and lift her up; and
immedi the fever left her and she minist unto them

1:32 and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that
were diseas and them that were possess with devil

1:33 and all the citi wa gather togeth at the door

1:34 and he heal mani that were sick of diver diseas and cast
out mani devils; and suffer not the devil to speak becaus they
knew him

1:35 and in the morn rise up a great while befor day he went
out and depart into a solitari place and there pray

1:36 and simon and they that were with him follow after him

1:37 and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for
thee

1:38 and he said unto them let us go into the next town that i may
preach there also: for therefor came i forth

1:39 and he preach in their synagogu throughout all galile and
cast out devil

1:40 and there came a leper to him beseech him and kneel down
to him and say unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

1:41 and jesu move with compass put forth hi hand and touch
him and saith unto him i will; be thou clean

1:42 and as soon as he had spoken immedi the leprosi depart
from him and he wa cleans

1:43 and he straitli charg him and forthwith sent him away; 1:44
and saith unto him see thou say noth to ani man: but go thi way
shew thyself to the priest and offer for thi cleans those thing
which mose command for a testimoni unto them

1:45 but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze
abroad the matter insomuch that jesu could no more openli enter into
the citi but wa without in desert places: and they came to him from
everi quarter

2:1 and again he enter into capernaum after some days; and it wa
nois that he wa in the hous

2:2 and straightway mani were gather togeth insomuch that there
wa no room to receiv them no not so much as about the door: and he
preach the word unto them

2:3 and they come unto him bring one sick of the palsi which wa
born of four

2:4 and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they
uncov the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsi lay

2:5 when jesu saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsi
son thi sin be forgiven thee

2:6 but there wa certain of the scribe sit there and reason
in their heart 2:7 whi doth thi man thu speak blasphemies? who can
forgiv sin but god only? 2:8 and immedi when jesu perceiv
in hi spirit that they so reason within themselv he said unto
them whi reason ye these thing in your hearts? 2:9 whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsi thi sin be forgiven thee; or
to say aris and take up thi bed and walk? 2:10 but that ye may
know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin (he
saith to the sick of the palsy) 2:11 i say unto thee aris and take
up thi bed and go thi way into thine hous

2:12 and immedi he aros took up the bed and went forth befor
them all; insomuch that they were all amaz and glorifi god
say we never saw it on thi fashion

2:13 and he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitud
resort unto him and he taught them

2:14 and as he pass by he saw levi the son of alphaeu sit at
the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he aros and
follow him

2:15 and it came to pass that as jesu sat at meat in hi hous
mani publican and sinner sat also togeth with jesu and hi
disciples: for there were mani and they follow him

2:16 and when the scribe and pharise saw him eat with publican and
sinner they said unto hi discipl how is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publican and sinners? 2:17 when jesu heard it he
saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician
but they that are sick: i came not to call the righteou but sinner
to repent

2:18 and the discipl of john and of the pharise use to fast: and
they come and say unto him whi do the discipl of john and of the
pharise fast but thi discipl fast not? 2:19 and jesu said unto
them can the children of the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom
is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them they
cannot fast

2:20 but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then shall they fast in those day

2:21 no man also seweth a piec of new cloth on an old garment: els
the new piec that fill it up taketh away from the old and the rent
is made wors

2:22 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles: els the new wine
doth burst the bottl and the wine is spill and the bottl will
be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottl

2:23 and it came to pass that he went through the corn field on the
sabbath day; and hi discipl began as they went to pluck the ear
of corn

2:24 and the pharise said unto him behold whi do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful? 2:25 and he said unto them
have ye never read what david did when he had need and wa an
hungr he and they that were with him? 2:26 how he went into the
hous of god in the day of abiathar the high priest and did eat the
shewbread which is not law to eat but for the priest and gave
also to them which were with him? 2:27 and he said unto them the
sabbath wa made for man and not man for the sabbath: 2:28 therefor
the son of man is lord also of the sabbath

3:1 and he enter again into the synagogue; and there wa a man there
which had a wither hand

3:2 and they watch him whether he would heal him on the sabbath
day; that they might accus him

3:3 and he saith unto the man which had the wither hand stand
forth

3:4 and he saith unto them is it law to do good on the sabbath
day or to do evil? to save life or to kill? but they held their
peac

3:5 and when he had look round about on them with anger be
griev for the hard of their heart he saith unto the man
stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it out: and hi hand wa
restor whole as the other

3:6 and the pharise went forth and straightway took counsel with
the herodian against him how they might destroy him

3:7 but jesu withdrew himself with hi discipl to the sea: and a
great multitud from galile follow him and from judaea 3:8 and
from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan; and they
about tyre and sidon a great multitud when they had heard what
great thing he did came unto him

3:9 and he spake to hi discipl that a small ship should wait on
him becaus of the multitud lest they should throng him

3:10 for he had heal many; insomuch that they press upon him for
to touch him as mani as had plagu

3:11 and unclean spirit when they saw him fell down befor him and
cri say thou art the son of god

3:12 and he straitli charg them that they should not make him known

3:13 and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he
would: and they came unto him

3:14 and he ordain twelv that they should be with him and that he
might send them forth to preach 3:15 and to have power to heal
sick and to cast out devils: 3:16 and simon he surnam peter;
3:17 and jame the son of zebede and john the brother of james; and
he surnam them boanerg which is the son of thunder: 3:18 and
andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thoma and
jame the son of alphaeu and thaddaeu and simon the canaanit
3:19 and juda iscariot which also betray him: and they went into
an hous

3:20 and the multitud cometh togeth again so that they could not
so much as eat bread

3:21 and when hi friend heard of it they went out to lay hold on
him: for they said he is besid himself

3:22 and the scribe which came down from jerusalem said he hath
beelzebub and by the princ of the devil casteth he out devil

3:23 and he call them unto him and said unto them in parabl how
can satan cast out satan? 3:24 and if a kingdom be divid against
itself that kingdom cannot stand

3:25 and if a hous be divid against itself that hous cannot
stand

3:26 and if satan rise up against himself and be divid he cannot
stand but hath an end

3:27 no man can enter into a strong man hous and spoil hi good
except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil hi
hous

3:28 verili i say unto you all sin shall be forgiven unto the son
of men and blasphemi wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 3:29
but he that shall blasphem against the holi ghost hath never
forgiv but is in danger of etern damnat

3:30 becaus they said he hath an unclean spirit

3:31 there came then hi brethren and hi mother and stand
without sent unto him call him

3:32 and the multitud sat about him and they said unto him behold
thi mother and thi brethren without seek for thee

3:33 and he answer them say who is my mother or my brethren?
3:34 and he look round about on them which sat about him and said
behold my mother and my brethren! 3:35 for whosoev shall do the
will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother

4:1 and he began again to teach by the sea side: and there wa
gather unto him a great multitud so that he enter into a ship
and sat in the sea; and the whole multitud wa by the sea on the
land

4:2 and he taught them mani thing by parabl and said unto them in
hi doctrin 4:3 hearken; behold there went out a sower to sow: 4:4
and it came to pass as he sow some fell by the way side and the
fowl of the air came and devour it up

4:5 and some fell on stoni ground where it had not much earth; and
immedi it sprang up becaus it had no depth of earth: 4:6 but
when the sun wa up it wa scorched; and becaus it had no root it
wither away

4:7 and some fell among thorn and the thorn grew up and choke it
and it yield no fruit

4:8 and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased; and brought forth some thirti and some sixti and
some an hundr

4:9 and he said unto them he that hath ear to hear let him hear

4:10 and when he wa alon they that were about him with the twelv
ask of him the parabl

4:11 and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteri
of the kingdom of god: but unto them that are without all these
thing are done in parables: 4:12 that see they may see and not
perceive; and hear they may hear and not understand; lest at ani
time they should be convert and their sin should be forgiven them

4:13 and he said unto them know ye not thi parable? and how then
will ye know all parables? 4:14 the sower soweth the word

4:15 and these are they by the way side where the word is sown; but
when they have heard satan cometh immedi and taketh away the
word that wa sown in their heart

4:16 and these are they likewis which are sown on stoni ground; who
when they have heard the word immedi receiv it with gladness;
4:17 and have no root in themselv and so endur but for a time:
afterward when afflict or persecut ariseth for the word sake
immedi they are offend

4:18 and these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
word 4:19 and the care of thi world and the deceit of
rich and the lust of other thing enter in choke the word and
it becometh unfruit

4:20 and these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
the word and receiv it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some
sixti and some an hundr

4:21 and he said unto them is a candl brought to be put under a
bushel or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 4:22 for
there is noth hid which shall not be manifested; neither wa ani
thing kept secret but that it should come abroad

4:23 if ani man have ear to hear let him hear

4:24 and he said unto them take heed what ye hear: with what measur
ye mete it shall be measur to you: and unto you that hear shall
more be given

4:25 for he that hath to him shall be given: and he that hath not
from him shall be taken even that which he hath

4:26 and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast
seed into the ground; 4:27 and should sleep and rise night and day
and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how

4:28 for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade
then the ear after that the full corn in the ear

4:29 but when the fruit is brought forth immedi he putteth in
the sickl becaus the harvest is come

4:30 and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god? or with
what comparison shall we compar it? 4:31 it is like a grain of
mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all
the seed that be in the earth: 4:32 but when it is sown it groweth
up and becometh greater than all herb and shooteth out great
branches; so that the fowl of the air may lodg under the shadow of
it

4:33 and with mani such parabl spake he the word unto them as they
were abl to hear it

4:34 but without a parabl spake he not unto them: and when they were
alon he expound all thing to hi discipl

4:35 and the same day when the even wa come he saith unto them let
us pass over unto the other side

4:36 and when they had sent away the multitud they took him even as
he wa in the ship and there were also with him other littl ship

4:37 and there aros a great storm of wind and the wave beat into
the ship so that it wa now full

4:38 and he wa in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow:
and they awak him and say unto him master carest thou not that we
perish? 4:39 and he aros and rebuk the wind and said unto the
sea peac be still and the wind ceas and there wa a great calm

4:40 and he said unto them whi are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
have no faith? 4:41 and they fear exceedingli and said one to
anoth what manner of man is thi that even the wind and the sea
obey him? 5:1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into
the countri of the gadaren

5:2 and when he wa come out of the ship immedi there met him
out of the tomb a man with an unclean spirit 5:3 who had hi
dwell among the tombs; and no man could bind him no not with
chains: 5:4 becaus that he had been often bound with fetter and
chain and the chain had been pluck asund by him and the
fetter broken in pieces: neither could ani man tame him

5:5 and alway night and day he wa in the mountain and in the
tomb cri and cut himself with stone

5:6 but when he saw jesu afar off he ran and worship him 5:7 and
cri with a loud voic and said what have i to do with thee jesu
thou son of the most high god? i adjur thee by god that thou torment
me not

5:8 for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit

5:9 and he ask him what is thi name? and he answer say my
name is legion: for we are mani

5:10 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
the countri

5:11 now there wa there nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine
feed

5:12 and all the devil besought him say send us into the swine
that we may enter into them

5:13 and forthwith jesu gave them leav and the unclean spirit went
out and enter into the swine: and the herd ran violent down a
steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand;) and were
choke in the sea

5:14 and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the citi and in
the countri and they went out to see what it wa that wa done

5:15 and they come to jesu and see him that wa possess with the
devil and had the legion sit and cloth and in hi right
mind: and they were afraid

5:16 and they that saw it told them how it befel to him that wa
possess with the devil and also concern the swine

5:17 and they began to pray him to depart out of their coast

5:18 and when he wa come into the ship he that had been possess
with the devil pray him that he might be with him

5:19 howbeit jesu suffer him not but saith unto him go home to
thi friend and tell them how great thing the lord hath done for
thee and hath had compass on thee

5:20 and he depart and began to publish in decapoli how great
thing jesu had done for him: and all men did marvel

5:21 and when jesu wa pass over again by ship unto the other side
much peopl gather unto him: and he wa nigh unto the sea

5:22 and behold there cometh one of the ruler of the synagogu
jairu by name; and when he saw him he fell at hi feet 5:23 and
besought him greatli say my littl daughter lieth at the point of
death: i pray thee come and lay thi hand on her that she may be
healed; and she shall live

5:24 and jesu went with him; and much peopl follow him and
throng him

5:25 and a certain woman which had an issu of blood twelv year
5:26 and had suffer mani thing of mani physician and had spent
all that she had and wa noth better but rather grew wors
5:27 when she had heard of jesu came in the press behind and

5:28 for she said if i may touch but hi cloth i shall be whole

5:29 and straightway the fountain of her blood wa dri up; and she
felt in her bodi that she wa heal of that plagu

5:30 and jesu immedi know in himself that virtu had gone
out of him turn him about in the press and said who touch my
clothes? 5:31 and hi discipl said unto him thou seest the
multitud throng thee and sayest thou who touch me? 5:32 and
he look round about to see her that had done thi thing

5:33 but the woman fear and trembl know what wa done in
her came and fell down befor him and told him all the truth

5:34 and he said unto her daughter thi faith hath made thee whole;
go in peac and be whole of thi plagu

5:35 while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogu
hous certain which said thi daughter is dead: whi troublest thou the
master ani further? 5:36 as soon as jesu heard the word that wa
spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogu be not afraid onli
believ

5:37 and he suffer no man to follow him save peter and jame and
john the brother of jame

5:38 and he cometh to the hous of the ruler of the synagogu and
seeth the tumult and them that wept and wail greatli

5:39 and when he wa come in he saith unto them whi make ye thi
ado and weep? the damsel is not dead but sleepeth

5:40 and they laugh him to scorn but when he had put them all out
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were
with him and entereth in where the damsel wa lie

5:41 and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha
cumi; which is be interpret damsel i say unto thee aris

5:42 and straightway the damsel aros and walked; for she wa of the
age of twelv year and they were astonish with a great
astonish

5:43 and he charg them straitli that no man should know it; and
command that someth should be given her to eat

6:1 and he went out from thenc and came into hi own country; and
hi discipl follow him

6:2 and when the sabbath day wa come he began to teach in the
synagogue: and mani hear him were astonish say from whenc
hath thi man these things? and what wisdom is thi which is given
unto him that even such mighti work are wrought by hi hands? 6:3
is not thi the carpent the son of mari the brother of jame and
jose and of juda and simon? and are not hi sister here with us?
and they were offend at him

6:4 but jesu said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in
hi own countri and among hi own kin and in hi own hous

6:5 and he could there do no mighti work save that he laid hi hand
upon a few sick folk and heal them

6:6 and he marvel becaus of their unbelief and he went round
about the villag teach

6:7 and he call unto him the twelv and began to send them forth by
two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 6:8 and
command them that they should take noth for their journey save a
staff only; no scrip no bread no money in their purse: 6:9 but be
shod with sandals; and not put on two coat

6:10 and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an
hous there abid till ye depart from that place

6:11 and whosoev shall not receiv you nor hear you when ye depart
thenc shake off the dust under your feet for a testimoni against
them

verili i say unto you it shall be more toler for sodom and
gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that citi

6:12 and they went out and preach that men should repent

6:13 and they cast out mani devil and anoint with oil mani that
were sick and heal them

6:14 and king herod heard of him; (for hi name wa spread abroad:)
and he said that john the baptist wa risen from the dead and
therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him

6:15 other said that it is elia and other said that it is a
prophet or as one of the prophet

6:16 but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i
beheaded: he is risen from the dead

6:17 for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and
bound him in prison for herodia sake hi brother philip wife: for
he had marri her

6:18 for john had said unto herod it is not law for thee to have
thi brother wife

6:19 therefor herodia had a quarrel against him and would have
kill him; but she could not: 6:20 for herod fear john know
that he wa a just man and an holi and observ him; and when he
heard him he did mani thing and heard him gladli

6:21 and when a conveni day wa come that herod on hi birthday
made a supper to hi lord high captain and chief estat of
galilee; 6:22 and when the daughter of the said herodia came in and
danc and pleas herod and them that sat with him the king said
unto the damsel ask of me whatsoev thou wilt and i will give it
thee

6:23 and he sware unto her whatsoev thou shalt ask of me i will
give it thee unto the half of my kingdom

6:24 and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask?
and she said the head of john the baptist

6:25 and she came in straightway with hast unto the king and ask
say i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
john the baptist

6:26 and the king wa exceed sorry; yet for hi oath sake and
for their sake which sat with him he would not reject her

6:27 and immedi the king sent an execution and command hi
head to be brought: and he went and behead him in the prison 6:28
and brought hi head in a charger and gave it to the damsel: and the
damsel gave it to her mother

6:29 and when hi discipl heard of it they came and took up hi
corps and laid it in a tomb

6:30 and the apostl gather themselv togeth unto jesu and
told him all thing both what they had done and what they had
taught

6:31 and he said unto them come ye yourselv apart into a desert
place and rest a while: for there were mani come and go and
they had no leisur so much as to eat

6:32 and they depart into a desert place by ship privat

6:33 and the peopl saw them depart and mani knew him and ran
afoot thither out of all citi and outwent them and came togeth
unto him

6:34 and jesu when he came out saw much peopl and wa move with
compass toward them becaus they were as sheep not have a
shepherd: and he began to teach them mani thing

6:35 and when the day wa now far spent hi discipl came unto him
and said thi is a desert place and now the time is far passed: 6:36
send them away that they may go into the countri round about and
into the villag and buy themselv bread: for they have noth to
eat

6:37 he answer and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say
unto him shall we go and buy two hundr pennyworth of bread and
give them to eat? 6:38 he saith unto them how mani loav have ye?
go and see and when they knew they say five and two fish

6:39 and he command them to make all sit down by compani upon the
green grass

6:40 and they sat down in rank by hundr and by fifti

6:41 and when he had taken the five loav and the two fish he
look up to heaven and bless and brake the loav and gave them
to hi discipl to set befor them; and the two fish divid he
among them all

6:42 and they did all eat and were fill

6:43 and they took up twelv basket full of the fragment and of the
fish

6:44 and they that did eat of the loav were about five thousand men

6:45 and straightway he constrain hi discipl to get into the
ship and to go to the other side befor unto bethsaida while he sent
away the peopl

6:46 and when he had sent them away he depart into a mountain to
pray

6:47 and when even wa come the ship wa in the midst of the sea and
he alon on the land

6:48 and he saw them toil in rowing; for the wind wa contrari unto
them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them
walk upon the sea and would have pass by them

6:49 but when they saw him walk upon the sea they suppos it had
been a spirit and cri out: 6:50 for they all saw him and were
troubl and immedi he talk with them and saith unto them be
of good cheer: it is i; be not afraid

6:51 and he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
they were sore amaz in themselv beyond measur and wonder

6:52 for they consid not the miracl of the loaves: for their
heart wa harden

6:53 and when they had pass over they came into the land of
gennesaret and drew to the shore

6:54 and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew
him 6:55 and ran through that whole region round about and began to
carri about in bed those that were sick where they heard he wa

6:56 and whithersoev he enter into villag or citi or
countri they laid the sick in the street and besought him that they
might touch if it were but the border of hi garment: and as mani as
touch him were made whole

7:1 then came togeth unto him the pharise and certain of the
scribe which came from jerusalem

7:2 and when they saw some of hi discipl eat bread with defil
that is to say with unwashen hand they found fault

7:3 for the pharise and all the jew except they wash their hand
oft eat not hold the tradit of the elder

7:4 and when they come from the market except they wash they eat
not

and mani other thing there be which they have receiv to hold as
the wash of cup and pot brasen vessel and of tabl

7:5 then the pharise and scribe ask him whi walk not thi
discipl accord to the tradit of the elder but eat bread with
unwashen hands? 7:6 he answer and said unto them well hath esaia
prophesi of you hypocrit as it is written thi peopl honoureth
me with their lip but their heart is far from me

7:7 howbeit in vain do they worship me teach for doctrin the
command of men

7:8 for lay asid the command of god ye hold the tradit of
men as the wash of pot and cups: and mani other such like thing
ye do

7:9 and he said unto them full well ye reject the command of god
that ye may keep your own tradit

7:10 for mose said honour thi father and thi mother; and whoso
curseth father or mother let him die the death: 7:11 but ye say if a
man shall say to hi father or mother it is corban that is to say a
gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me; he shall be free

7:12 and ye suffer him no more to do ought for hi father or hi
mother; 7:13 make the word of god of none effect through your
tradit which ye have delivered: and mani such like thing do ye

7:14 and when he had call all the peopl unto him he said unto
them hearken unto me everi one of you and understand: 7:15 there is
noth from without a man that enter into him can defil him: but
the thing which come out of him those are they that defil the man

7:16 if ani man have ear to hear let him hear

7:17 and when he wa enter into the hous from the peopl hi
discipl ask him concern the parabl

7:18 and he saith unto them are ye so without understand also? do
ye not perceiv that whatsoev thing from without entereth into the
man it cannot defil him; 7:19 becaus it entereth not into hi
heart but into the belli and goeth out into the draught purg all
meats? 7:20 and he said that which cometh out of the man that
defileth the man

7:21 for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thought
adulteri fornic murder 7:22 theft covet
wicked deceit lascivi an evil eye blasphemi pride
foolishness: 7:23 all these evil thing come from within and defil
the man

7:24 and from thenc he aros and went into the border of tyre and
sidon and enter into an hous and would have no man know it: but
he could not be hid

7:25 for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit
heard of him and came and fell at hi feet: 7:26 the woman wa a
greek a syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would
cast forth the devil out of her daughter

7:27 but jesu said unto her let the children first be filled: for it
is not meet to take the children bread and to cast it unto the
dog

7:28 and she answer and said unto him ye lord: yet the dog under
the tabl eat of the children crumb

7:29 and he said unto her for thi say go thi way; the devil is
gone out of thi daughter

7:30 and when she wa come to her hous she found the devil gone out
and her daughter laid upon the bed

7:31 and again depart from the coast of tyre and sidon he came
unto the sea of galile through the midst of the coast of decapoli

7:32 and they bring unto him one that wa deaf and had an impedi
in hi speech; and they beseech him to put hi hand upon him

7:33 and he took him asid from the multitud and put hi finger
into hi ear and he spit and touch hi tongue; 7:34 and look
up to heaven he sigh and saith unto him ephphatha that is be
open

7:35 and straightway hi ear were open and the string of hi
tongu wa loos and he spake plain

7:36 and he charg them that they should tell no man: but the more he
charg them so much the more a great deal they publish it; 7:37
and were beyond measur astonish say he hath done all thing
well: he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak

8:1 in those day the multitud be veri great and have noth
to eat jesu call hi discipl unto him and saith unto them 8:2
i have compass on the multitud becaus they have now been with me
three day and have noth to eat: 8:3 and if i send them away
fast to their own hous they will faint by the way: for diver of
them came from far

8:4 and hi discipl answer him from whenc can a man satisfi
these men with bread here in the wilderness? 8:5 and he ask them
how mani loav have ye? and they said seven

8:6 and he command the peopl to sit down on the ground: and he took
the seven loav and gave thank and brake and gave to hi
discipl to set befor them; and they did set them befor the peopl

8:7 and they had a few small fishes: and he bless and command to
set them also befor them

8:8 so they did eat and were filled: and they took up of the broken
meat that wa left seven basket

8:9 and they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them
away

8:10 and straightway he enter into a ship with hi discipl and
came into the part of dalmanutha

8:11 and the pharise came forth and began to question with him
seek of him a sign from heaven tempt him

8:12 and he sigh deepli in hi spirit and saith whi doth thi
gener seek after a sign? verili i say unto you there shall no
sign be given unto thi gener

8:13 and he left them and enter into the ship again depart to
the other side

8:14 now the discipl had forgotten to take bread neither had they
in the ship with them more than one loaf

8:15 and he charg them say take heed bewar of the leaven of
the pharise and of the leaven of herod

8:16 and they reason among themselv say it is becaus we have
no bread

8:17 and when jesu knew it he saith unto them whi reason ye
becaus ye have no bread? perceiv ye not yet neither understand?
have ye your heart yet hardened? 8:18 have eye see ye not? and
have ear hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 8:19 when i brake
the five loav among five thousand how mani basket full of
fragment took ye up? they say unto him twelv

8:20 and when the seven among four thousand how mani basket full of
fragment took ye up? and they said seven

8:21 and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand? 8:22
and he cometh to bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him and
besought him to touch him

8:23 and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the
town; and when he had spit on hi eye and put hi hand upon him he
ask him if he saw ought

8:24 and he look up and said i see men as tree walk

8:25 after that he put hi hand again upon hi eye and made him
look up: and he wa restor and saw everi man clearli

8:26 and he sent him away to hi hous say neither go into the
town nor tell it to ani in the town

8:27 and jesu went out and hi discipl into the town of caesarea
philippi: and by the way he ask hi discipl say unto them
whom do men say that i am? 8:28 and they answer john the baptist;
but some say elias; and other one of the prophet

8:29 and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am? and peter
answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ

8:30 and he charg them that they should tell no man of him

8:31 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer mani
thing and be reject of the elder and of the chief priest and
scribe and be kill and after three day rise again

8:32 and he spake that say openli and peter took him and began to
rebuk him

8:33 but when he had turn about and look on hi discipl he
rebuk peter say get thee behind me satan: for thou savourest
not the thing that be of god but the thing that be of men

8:34 and when he had call the peopl unto him with hi discipl
also he said unto them whosoev will come after me let him deni
himself and take up hi cross and follow me

8:35 for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it; but whosoev
shall lose hi life for my sake and the gospel the same shall save
it

8:36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world
and lose hi own soul? 8:37 or what shall a man give in exchang for
hi soul? 8:38 whosoev therefor shall be asham of me and of my
word in thi adulter and sin generation; of him also shall the
son of man be asham when he cometh in the glori of hi father with
the holi angel

9:1 and he said unto them verili i say unto you that there be some
of them that stand here which shall not tast of death till they
have seen the kingdom of god come with power

9:2 and after six day jesu taketh with him peter and jame and
john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves:
and he wa transfigur befor them

9:3 and hi raiment becam shine exceed white as snow; so as no
fuller on earth can white them

9:4 and there appear unto them elia with moses: and they were
talk with jesu

9:5 and peter answer and said to jesu master it is good for us to
be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee and one for
mose and one for elia

9:6 for he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid

9:7 and there wa a cloud that overshadow them: and a voic came out
of the cloud say thi is my belov son: hear him

9:8 and suddenli when they had look round about they saw no man
ani more save jesu onli with themselv

9:9 and as they came down from the mountain he charg them that they
should tell no man what thing they had seen till the son of man were
risen from the dead

9:10 and they kept that say with themselv question one with
anoth what the rise from the dead should mean

9:11 and they ask him say whi say the scribe that elia must
first come? 9:12 and he answer and told them elia verili cometh
first and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the son of
man that he must suffer mani thing and be set at nought

9:13 but i say unto you that elia is inde come and they have done
unto him whatsoev they list as it is written of him

9:14 and when he came to hi discipl he saw a great multitud about
them and the scribe question with them

9:15 and straightway all the peopl when they beheld him were
greatli amaz and run to him salut him

9:16 and he ask the scribe what question ye with them? 9:17 and
one of the multitud answer and said master i have brought unto
thee my son which hath a dumb spirit; 9:18 and wheresoev he taketh
him he teareth him: and he foameth and gnasheth with hi teeth and
pineth away: and i spake to thi discipl that they should cast him
out; and they could not

9:19 he answereth him and saith o faithless gener how long
shall i be with you? how long shall i suffer you? bring him unto me

9:20 and they brought him unto him: and when he saw him straightway
the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground and wallow foam

9:21 and he ask hi father how long is it ago sinc thi came unto
him? and he said of a child

9:22 and ofttim it hath cast him into the fire and into the water
to destroy him: but if thou canst do ani thing have compass on us
and help us

9:23 jesu said unto him if thou canst believ all thing are
possibl to him that believeth

9:24 and straightway the father of the child cri out and said with
tear lord i believe; help thou mine unbelief

9:25 when jesu saw that the peopl came run togeth he rebuk
the foul spirit say unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charg
thee come out of him and enter no more into him

9:26 and the spirit cri and rent him sore and came out of him: and
he wa as one dead; insomuch that mani said he is dead

9:27 but jesu took him by the hand and lift him up; and he aros

9:28 and when he wa come into the hous hi discipl ask him
privat whi could not we cast him out? 9:29 and he said unto them
thi kind can come forth by noth but by prayer and fast

9:30 and they depart thenc and pass through galilee; and he
would not that ani man should know it

9:31 for he taught hi discipl and said unto them the son of man
is deliv into the hand of men and they shall kill him; and after
that he is kill he shall rise the third day

9:32 but they understood not that say and were afraid to ask him

9:33 and he came to capernaum: and be in the hous he ask them
what wa it that ye disput among yourselv by the way? 9:34 but
they held their peace: for by the way they had disput among
themselv who should be the greatest

9:35 and he sat down and call the twelv and saith unto them if
ani man desir to be first the same shall be last of all and servant
of all

9:36 and he took a child and set him in the midst of them: and when
he had taken him in hi arm he said unto them 9:37 whosoev shall
receiv one of such children in my name receiveth me: and whosoev
shall receiv me receiveth not me but him that sent me

9:38 and john answer him say master we saw one cast out
devil in thi name and he followeth not us: and we forbad him
becaus he followeth not us

9:39 but jesu said forbid him not: for there is no man which shall
do a miracl in my name that can lightli speak evil of me

9:40 for he that is not against us is on our part

9:41 for whosoev shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name
becaus ye belong to christ verili i say unto you he shall not lose
hi reward

9:42 and whosoev shall offend one of these littl one that believ
in me it is better for him that a millston were hang about hi
neck and he were cast into the sea

9:43 and if thi hand offend thee cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter into life maim than have two hand to go into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched: 9:44 where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quench

9:45 and if thi foot offend thee cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter halt into life than have two feet to be cast into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched: 9:46 where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quench

9:47 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out: it is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than have two eye to
be cast into hell fire: 9:48 where their worm dieth not and the fire
is not quench

9:49 for everi one shall be salt with fire and everi sacrific
shall be salt with salt

9:50 salt is good: but if the salt have lost hi salt wherewith
will ye season it? have salt in yourselv and have peac one with
anoth

10:1 and he aros from thenc and cometh into the coast of judaea by
the farther side of jordan: and the peopl resort unto him again; and
as he wa wont he taught them again

10:2 and the pharise came to him and ask him is it law for a
man to put away hi wife? tempt him

10:3 and he answer and said unto them what did mose command you?
10:4 and they said mose suffer to write a bill of divorc and
to put her away

10:5 and jesu answer and said unto them for the hard of your
heart he wrote you thi precept

10:6 but from the begin of the creation god made them male and
femal

10:7 for thi caus shall a man leav hi father and mother and
cleav to hi wife; 10:8 and they twain shall be one flesh: so then
they are no more twain but one flesh

10:9 what therefor god hath join togeth let not man put asund

10:10 and in the hous hi discipl ask him again of the same
matter

10:11 and he saith unto them whosoev shall put away hi wife and
marri anoth committeth adulteri against her

10:12 and if a woman shall put away her husband and be marri to
anoth she committeth adulteri

10:13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch
them: and hi discipl rebuk those that brought them

10:14 but when jesu saw it he wa much displeas and said unto
them suffer the littl children to come unto me and forbid them not:
for of such is the kingdom of god

10:15 verili i say unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom
of god as a littl child he shall not enter therein

10:16 and he took them up in hi arm put hi hand upon them and
bless them

10:17 and when he wa gone forth into the way there came one run
and kneel to him and ask him good master what shall i do that i
may inherit etern life? 10:18 and jesu said unto him whi callest
thou me good? there is none good but one that is god

10:19 thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not
kill do not steal do not bear fals wit defraud not honour thi
father and mother 10:20 and he answer and said unto him master
all these have i observ from my youth

10:21 then jesu behold him love him and said unto him one thing
thou lackest: go thi way sell whatsoev thou hast and give to the
poor and thou shalt have treasur in heaven: and come take up the
cross and follow me

10:22 and he wa sad at that say and went away grieved: for he had
great possess

10:23 and jesu look round about and saith unto hi discipl how
hardli shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god!
10:24 and the discipl were astonish at hi word but jesu
answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for
them that trust in rich to enter into the kingdom of god! 10:25 it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needl than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of god

10:26 and they were astonish out of measur say among
themselv who then can be saved? 10:27 and jesu look upon them
saith with men it is imposs but not with god: for with god all
thing are possibl

10:28 then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have
follow thee

10:29 and jesu answer and said verili i say unto you there is no
man that hath left hous or brethren or sister or father or
mother or wife or children or land for my sake and the gospel
10:30 but he shall receiv an hundredfold now in thi time hous
and brethren and sister and mother and children and land with
persecutions; and in the world to come etern life

10:31 but mani that are first shall be last; and the last first

10:32 and they were in the way go up to jerusalem; and jesu went
befor them: and they were amazed; and as they follow they were
afraid

and he took again the twelv and began to tell them what thing
should happen unto him 10:33 say behold we go up to jerusalem;
and the son of man shall be deliv unto the chief priest and unto
the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliv
him to the gentiles: 10:34 and they shall mock him and shall scourg
him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him: and the third day he
shall rise again

10:35 and jame and john the son of zebede come unto him say
master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoev we shall
desir

10:36 and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you?
10:37 they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thi
right hand and the other on thi left hand in thi glori

10:38 but jesu said unto them ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink
of the cup that i drink of? and be baptiz with the baptism that i am
baptiz with? 10:39 and they said unto him we can and jesu said
unto them ye shall inde drink of the cup that i drink of; and with
the baptism that i am baptiz withal shall ye be baptized: 10:40 but
to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepar

10:41 and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeas with
jame and john

10:42 but jesu call them to him and saith unto them ye know that
they which are account to rule over the gentil exercis lordship
over them; and their great one exercis author upon them

10:43 but so shall it not be among you: but whosoev will be great
among you shall be your minister: 10:44 and whosoev of you will be
the chiefest shall be servant of all

10:45 for even the son of man came not to be minist unto but to
minist and to give hi life a ransom for mani

10:46 and they came to jericho: and as he went out of jericho with hi
discipl and a great number of peopl blind bartimaeu the son of
timaeu sat by the highway side beg

10:47 and when he heard that it wa jesu of nazareth he began to cri
out and say jesu thou son of david have merci on me

10:48 and mani charg him that he should hold hi peace: but he cri
the more a great deal thou son of david have merci on me

10:49 and jesu stood still and command him to be call and they
call the blind man say unto him be of good comfort rise; he
calleth thee

10:50 and he cast away hi garment rose and came to jesu

10:51 and jesu answer and said unto him what wilt thou that i
should do unto thee? the blind man said unto him lord that i might
receiv my sight

10:52 and jesu said unto him go thi way; thi faith hath made thee
whole

and immedi he receiv hi sight and follow jesu in the way

11:1 and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphag and bethani
at the mount of oliv he sendeth forth two of hi discipl 11:2
and saith unto them go your way into the villag over against you:
and as soon as ye be enter into it ye shall find a colt tie
whereon never man sat; loos him and bring him

11:3 and if ani man say unto you whi do ye this? say ye that the lord
hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither

11:4 and they went their way and found the colt tie by the door
without in a place where two way met; and they loos him

11:5 and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye
loos the colt? 11:6 and they said unto them even as jesu had
commanded: and they let them go

11:7 and they brought the colt to jesu and cast their garment on
him; and he sat upon him

11:8 and mani spread their garment in the way: and other cut down
branch off the tree and straw them in the way

11:9 and they that went befor and they that follow cri say
hosanna; bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord: 11:10
bless be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of
the lord: hosanna in the highest

11:11 and jesu enter into jerusalem and into the temple: and when
he had look round about upon all thing and now the eventid wa
come he went out unto bethani with the twelv

11:12 and on the morrow when they were come from bethani he wa
hungry: 11:13 and see a fig tree afar off have leav he came
if hapli he might find ani thing thereon: and when he came to it he
found noth but leaves; for the time of fig wa not yet

11:14 and jesu answer and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee
hereaft for ever and hi discipl heard it

11:15 and they come to jerusalem: and jesu went into the templ and
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the templ and
overthrew the tabl of the moneychang and the seat of them that
sold doves; 11:16 and would not suffer that ani man should carri ani
vessel through the templ

11:17 and he taught say unto them is it not written my hous
shall be call of all nation the hous of prayer? but ye have made
it a den of thiev

11:18 and the scribe and chief priest heard it and sought how they
might destroy him: for they fear him becaus all the peopl wa
astonish at hi doctrin

11:19 and when even wa come he went out of the citi

11:20 and in the morn as they pass by they saw the fig tree
dri up from the root

11:21 and peter call to remembr saith unto him master behold
the fig tree which thou cursedst is wither away

11:22 and jesu answer saith unto them have faith in god

11:23 for verili i say unto you that whosoev shall say unto thi
mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the sea; and shall
not doubt in hi heart but shall believ that those thing which he
saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoev he saith

11:24 therefor i say unto you what thing soever ye desir when ye
pray believ that ye receiv them and ye shall have them

11:25 and when ye stand pray forgiv if ye have ought against
any: that your father also which is in heaven may forgiv you your
trespass

11:26 but if ye do not forgiv neither will your father which is in
heaven forgiv your trespass

11:27 and they come again to jerusalem: and as he wa walk in the
templ there come to him the chief priest and the scribe and the
elder 11:28 and say unto him by what author doest thou these
things? and who gave thee thi author to do these things? 11:29
and jesu answer and said unto them i will also ask of you one
question and answer me and i will tell you by what author i do
these thing

11:30 the baptism of john wa it from heaven or of men? answer me

11:31 and they reason with themselv say if we shall say from
heaven; he will say whi then did ye not believ him? 11:32 but if we
shall say of men; they fear the people: for all men count john
that he wa a prophet inde

11:33 and they answer and said unto jesu we cannot tell and jesu
answer saith unto them neither do i tell you by what author i
do these thing

12:1 and he began to speak unto them by parabl a certain man
plant a vineyard and set an hedg about it and dig a place for
the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went
into a far countri

12:2 and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he
might receiv from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard

12:3 and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empti

12:4 and again he sent unto them anoth servant; and at him they cast
stone and wound him in the head and sent him away shame
handl

12:5 and again he sent another; and him they kill and mani others;
beat some and kill some

12:6 have yet therefor one son hi wellbelov he sent him also
last unto them say they will rever my son

12:7 but those husbandmen said among themselv thi is the heir;
come let us kill him and the inherit shall be our

12:8 and they took him and kill him and cast him out of the
vineyard

12:9 what shall therefor the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto other

12:10 and have ye not read thi scripture; the stone which the
builder reject is becom the head of the corner: 12:11 thi wa the
lord do and it is marvel in our eyes? 12:12 and they sought
to lay hold on him but fear the people: for they knew that he had
spoken the parabl against them: and they left him and went their
way

12:13 and they send unto him certain of the pharise and of the
herodian to catch him in hi word

12:14 and when they were come they say unto him master we know that
thou art true and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the
person of men but teachest the way of god in truth: is it law to
give tribut to caesar or not? 12:15 shall we give or shall we not
give? but he know their hypocrisi said unto them whi tempt ye
me? bring me a penni that i may see it

12:16 and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is thi imag
and superscription? and they said unto him caesar

12:17 and jesu answer said unto them render to caesar the thing
that are caesar and to god the thing that are god and they
marvel at him

12:18 then come unto him the sadduce which say there is no
resurrection; and they ask him say 12:19 master mose wrote
unto us if a man brother die and leav hi wife behind him and
leav no children that hi brother should take hi wife and rais up
seed unto hi brother

12:20 now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife and
die left no seed

12:21 and the second took her and die neither left he ani seed: and
the third likewis

12:22 and the seven had her and left no seed: last of all the woman
die also

12:23 in the resurrect therefor when they shall rise whose wife
shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife

12:24 and jesu answer said unto them do ye not therefor err
becaus ye know not the scriptur neither the power of god? 12:25
for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marri nor are
given in marriage; but are as the angel which are in heaven

12:26 and as touch the dead that they rise: have ye not read in
the book of mose how in the bush god spake unto him say i am
the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob? 12:27
he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living: ye therefor
do greatli err

12:28 and one of the scribe came and have heard them reason
togeth and perceiv that he had answer them well ask him
which is the first command of all? 12:29 and jesu answer him
the first of all the command is hear o israel; the lord our god
is one lord: 12:30 and thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi
heart and with all thi soul and with all thi mind and with all thi
strength: thi is the first command

12:31 and the second is like name thi thou shalt love thi
neighbour as thyself there is none other command greater than
these

12:32 and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the
truth: for there is one god; and there is none other but he: 12:33 and
to love him with all the heart and with all the understand and
with all the soul and with all the strength and to love hi
neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offer and
sacrific

12:34 and when jesu saw that he answer discreetli he said unto
him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that
durst ask him ani question

12:35 and jesu answer and said while he taught in the templ how
say the scribe that christ is the son of david? 12:36 for david
himself said by the holi ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on
my right hand till i make thine enemi thi footstool

12:37 david therefor himself calleth him lord; and whenc is he then
hi son? and the common peopl heard him gladli

12:38 and he said unto them in hi doctrin bewar of the scribe
which love to go in long cloth and love salut in the
marketplac 12:39 and the chief seat in the synagogu and the
uppermost room at feasts: 12:40 which devour widow hous and for
a pretenc make long prayers: these shall receiv greater damnat

12:41 and jesu sat over against the treasuri and beheld how the
peopl cast money into the treasury: and mani that were rich cast in
much

12:42 and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mite
which make a farth

12:43 and he call unto him hi discipl and saith unto them
verili i say unto you that thi poor widow hath cast more in than
all they which have cast into the treasury: 12:44 for all they did
cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that
she had even all her live

13:1 and as he went out of the templ one of hi discipl saith unto
him master see what manner of stone and what build are here!
13:2 and jesu answer said unto him seest thou these great
buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon anoth that shall
not be thrown down

13:3 and as he sat upon the mount of oliv over against the templ
peter and jame and john and andrew ask him privat 13:4 tell us
when shall these thing be? and what shall be the sign when all these
thing shall be fulfilled? 13:5 and jesu answer them began to
say take heed lest ani man deceiv you: 13:6 for mani shall come in
my name say i am christ; and shall deceiv mani

13:7 and when ye shall hear of war and rumour of war be ye not
troubled: for such thing must need be; but the end shall not be yet

13:8 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom: and there shall be earthquak in diver place and there
shall be famin and troubles: these are the begin of sorrow

13:9 but take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliv you up to
councils; and in the synagogu ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be
brought befor ruler and king for my sake for a testimoni against
them

13:10 and the gospel must first be publish among all nation

13:11 but when they shall lead you and deliv you up take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate: but
whatsoev shall be given you in that hour that speak ye: for it is
not ye that speak but the holi ghost

13:12 now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the
father the son; and children shall rise up against their parent and
shall caus them to be put to death

13:13 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name sake: but he that
shall endur unto the end the same shall be save

13:14 but when ye shall see the abomin of desol spoken of
by daniel the prophet stand where it ought not (let him that
readeth understand) then let them that be in judaea flee to the
mountains: 13:15 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into
the hous neither enter therein to take ani thing out of hi house:
13:16 and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
up hi garment

13:17 but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck
in those days! 13:18 and pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter

13:19 for in those day shall be afflict such as wa not from the
begin of the creation which god creat unto thi time neither
shall be

13:20 and except that the lord had shorten those day no flesh
should be saved: but for the elect sake whom he hath chosen he
hath shorten the day

13:21 and then if ani man shall say to you lo here is christ; or
lo he is there; believ him not: 13:22 for fals christ and fals
prophet shall rise and shall shew sign and wonder to seduc if
it were possibl even the elect

13:23 but take ye heed: behold i have foretold you all thing

13:24 but in those day after that tribul the sun shall be
darken and the moon shall not give her light 13:25 and the star
of heaven shall fall and the power that are in heaven shall be
shaken

13:26 and then shall they see the son of man come in the cloud with
great power and glori

13:27 and then shall he send hi angel and shall gather togeth hi
elect from the four wind from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven

13:28 now learn a parabl of the fig tree; when her branch is yet
tender and putteth forth leav ye know that summer is near: 13:29
so ye in like manner when ye shall see these thing come to pass
know that it is nigh even at the door

13:30 verili i say unto you that thi gener shall not pass till
all these thing be done

13:31 heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass
away

13:32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angel
which are in heaven neither the son but the father

13:33 take ye heed watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is

13:34 for the son of man is as a man take a far journey who left
hi hous and gave author to hi servant and to everi man hi
work and command the porter to watch

13:35 watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the hous
cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrow or in the
morning: 13:36 lest come suddenli he find you sleep

13:37 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch

14:1 after two day wa the feast of the passov and of unleaven
bread: and the chief priest and the scribe sought how they might
take him by craft and put him to death

14:2 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of
the peopl

14:3 and be in bethani in the hous of simon the leper as he sat
at meat there came a woman have an alabast box of ointment of
spikenard veri precious; and she brake the box and pour it on hi
head

14:4 and there were some that had indign within themselv and
said whi wa thi wast of the ointment made? 14:5 for it might have
been sold for more than three hundr penc and have been given to
the poor and they murmur against her

14:6 and jesu said let her alone; whi troubl ye her? she hath
wrought a good work on me

14:7 for ye have the poor with you alway and whensoev ye will ye
may do them good: but me ye have not alway

14:8 she hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
bodi to the buri

14:9 verili i say unto you wheresoev thi gospel shall be preach
throughout the whole world thi also that she hath done shall be
spoken of for a memori of her

14:10 and juda iscariot one of the twelv went unto the chief
priest to betray him unto them

14:11 and when they heard it they were glad and promis to give him
money and he sought how he might conveni betray him

14:12 and the first day of unleaven bread when they kill the
passov hi discipl said unto him where wilt thou that we go and
prepar that thou mayest eat the passover? 14:13 and he sendeth forth
two of hi discipl and saith unto them go ye into the citi and
there shall meet you a man bear a pitcher of water: follow him

14:14 and wheresoev he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the
hous the master saith where is the guestchamb where i shall eat
the passov with my disciples? 14:15 and he will shew you a larg
upper room furnish and prepared: there make readi for us

14:16 and hi discipl went forth and came into the citi and found
as he had said unto them: and they made readi the passov

14:17 and in the even he cometh with the twelv

14:18 and as they sat and did eat jesu said verili i say unto you
one of you which eateth with me shall betray me

14:19 and they began to be sorrow and to say unto him one by one
is it i? and anoth said is it i? 14:20 and he answer and said
unto them it is one of the twelv that dippeth with me in the dish

14:21 the son of man inde goeth as it is written of him: but woe to
that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man
if he had never been born

14:22 and as they did eat jesu took bread and bless and brake
it and gave to them and said take eat: thi is my bodi

14:23 and he took the cup and when he had given thank he gave it to
them: and they all drank of it

14:24 and he said unto them thi is my blood of the new testament
which is shed for mani

14:25 verili i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god

14:26 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
oliv

14:27 and jesu saith unto them all ye shall be offend becaus of
me thi night: for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scatter

14:28 but after that i am risen i will go befor you into galile

14:29 but peter said unto him although all shall be offend yet
will not i

14:30 and jesu saith unto him verili i say unto thee that thi day
even in thi night befor the cock crow twice thou shalt deni me
thrice

14:31 but he spake the more vehement if i should die with thee i
will not deni thee in ani wise likewis also said they all

14:32 and they came to a place which wa name gethsemane: and he
saith to hi discipl sit ye here while i shall pray

14:33 and he taketh with him peter and jame and john and began to be
sore amaz and to be veri heavy; 14:34 and saith unto them my soul
is exceed sorrow unto death: tarri ye here and watch

14:35 and he went forward a littl and fell on the ground and pray
that if it were possibl the hour might pass from him

14:36 and he said abba father all thing are possibl unto thee;
take away thi cup from me: nevertheless not what i will but what
thou wilt

14:37 and he cometh and findeth them sleep and saith unto peter
simon sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 14:38 watch
ye and pray lest ye enter into temptat the spirit truli is readi
but the flesh is weak

14:39 and again he went away and pray and spake the same word

14:40 and when he return he found them asleep again (for their
eye were heavy) neither wist they what to answer him

14:41 and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now
and take your rest: it is enough the hour is come; behold the son of
man is betray into the hand of sinner

14:42 rise up let us go; lo he that betrayeth me is at hand

14:43 and immedi while he yet spake cometh juda one of the
twelv and with him a great multitud with sword and stave from
the chief priest and the scribe and the elder

14:44 and he that betray him had given them a token say
whomsoev i shall kiss that same is he; take him and lead him away
safe

14:45 and as soon as he wa come he goeth straightway to him and
saith master master; and kiss him

14:46 and they laid their hand on him and took him

14:47 and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant
of the high priest and cut off hi ear

14:48 and jesu answer and said unto them are ye come out as
against a thief with sword and with stave to take me? 14:49 i wa
daili with you in the templ teach and ye took me not: but the
scriptur must be fulfil

14:50 and they all forsook him and fled

14:51 and there follow him a certain young man have a linen cloth
cast about hi nake body; and the young men laid hold on him: 14:52
and he left the linen cloth and fled from them nake

14:53 and they led jesu away to the high priest: and with him were
assembl all the chief priest and the elder and the scribe

14:54 and peter follow him afar off even into the palac of the
high priest: and he sat with the servant and warm himself at the
fire

14:55 and the chief priest and all the council sought for wit
against jesu to put him to death; and found none

14:56 for mani bare fals wit against him but their wit
agre not togeth

14:57 and there aros certain and bare fals wit against him
say 14:58 we heard him say i will destroy thi templ that is
made with hand and within three day i will build anoth made
without hand

14:59 but neither so did their wit agre togeth

14:60 and the high priest stood up in the midst and ask jesu
say answerest thou nothing? what is it which these wit against
thee? 14:61 but he held hi peac and answer noth again the
high priest ask him and said unto him art thou the christ the son
of the blessed? 14:62 and jesu said i am: and ye shall see the son
of man sit on the right hand of power and come in the cloud of
heaven

14:63 then the high priest rent hi cloth and saith what need we
ani further witnesses? 14:64 ye have heard the blasphemy: what think
ye? and they all condemn him to be guilti of death

14:65 and some began to spit on him and to cover hi face and to
buffet him and to say unto him prophesy: and the servant did strike
him with the palm of their hand

14:66 and as peter wa beneath in the palac there cometh one of the
maid of the high priest: 14:67 and when she saw peter warm
himself she look upon him and said and thou also wast with jesu
of nazareth

14:68 but he deni say i know not neither understand i what
thou sayest and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew

14:69 and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood
by thi is one of them

14:70 and he deni it again and a littl after they that stood by
said again to peter sure thou art one of them: for thou art a
galilaean and thi speech agreeth thereto

14:71 but he began to curs and to swear say i know not thi man
of whom ye speak

14:72 and the second time the cock crew and peter call to mind the
word that jesu said unto him befor the cock crow twice thou shalt
deni me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept

15:1 and straightway in the morn the chief priest held a
consult with the elder and scribe and the whole council and

4:35 and jesu rebuk him say hold thi peac and come out of
him

and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him
and hurt him not

4:36 and they were all amaz and spake among themselv say
what a word is this! for with author and power he commandeth the
unclean spirit and they come out

4:37 and the fame of him went out into everi place of the countri
round about

4:38 and he aros out of the synagogu and enter into simon
hous

and simon wife mother wa taken with a great fever; and they
besought him for her

4:39 and he stood over her and rebuk the fever; and it left her:
and immedi she aros and minist unto them

4:40 now when the sun wa set all they that had ani sick with
diver diseas brought them unto him; and he laid hi hand on everi
one of them and heal them

4:41 and devil also came out of mani cri out and say thou
art christ the son of god and he rebuk them suffer them not to
speak: for they knew that he wa christ

4:42 and when it wa day he depart and went into a desert place:
and the peopl sought him and came unto him and stay him that he
should not depart from them

4:43 and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other
citi also: for therefor am i sent

4:44 and he preach in the synagogu of galile

5:1 and it came to pass that as the peopl press upon him to hear
the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret 5:2 and saw two
ship stand by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them
and were wash their net

5:3 and he enter into one of the ship which wa simon and
pray him that he would thrust out a littl from the land and he sat
down and taught the peopl out of the ship

5:4 now when he had left speak he said unto simon launch out into
the deep and let down your net for a draught

5:5 and simon answer said unto him master we have toil all the
night and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thi word i will let
down the net

5:6 and when they had thi done they inclos a great multitud of
fishes: and their net brake

5:7 and they beckon unto their partner which were in the other
ship that they should come and help them and they came and fill
both the ship so that they began to sink

5:8 when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesu knee say
depart from me; for i am a sin man o lord

5:9 for he wa astonish and all that were with him at the draught
of the fish which they had taken: 5:10 and so wa also jame and
john the son of zebede which were partner with simon and jesu
said unto simon fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men

5:11 and when they had brought their ship to land they forsook all
and follow him

5:12 and it came to pass when he wa in a certain citi behold a man
full of leprosy: who see jesu fell on hi face and besought him
say lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean

5:13 and he put forth hi hand and touch him say i will: be
thou clean and immedi the leprosi depart from him

5:14 and he charg him to tell no man: but go and shew thyself to
the priest and offer for thi cleans accord as mose command
for a testimoni unto them

5:15 but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
multitud came togeth to hear and to be heal by him of their
infirm

5:16 and he withdrew himself into the wilder and pray

5:17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he wa teach that
there were pharise and doctor of the law sit by which were
come out of everi town of galile and judaea and jerusalem: and the
power of the lord wa present to heal them

5:18 and behold men brought in a bed a man which wa taken with a
palsy: and they sought mean to bring him in and to lay him befor
him

5:19 and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
becaus of the multitud they went upon the housetop and let him
down through the tile with hi couch into the midst befor jesu

5:20 and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thi sin are
forgiven thee

5:21 and the scribe and the pharise began to reason say who is
thi which speaketh blasphemies? who can forgiv sin but god alone?
5:22 but when jesu perceiv their thought he answer said unto
them what reason ye in your hearts? 5:23 whether is easier to say
thi sin be forgiven thee; or to say rise up and walk? 5:24 but that
ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgiv sin
(he said unto the sick of the palsy) i say unto thee aris and take
up thi couch and go into thine hous

5:25 and immedi he rose up befor them and took up that whereon
he lay and depart to hi own hous glorifi god

5:26 and they were all amaz and they glorifi god and were fill
with fear say we have seen strang thing to day

5:27 and after these thing he went forth and saw a publican name
levi sit at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him follow
me

5:28 and he left all rose up and follow him

5:29 and levi made him a great feast in hi own house: and there wa a
great compani of publican and of other that sat down with them

5:30 but their scribe and pharise murmur against hi discipl
say whi do ye eat and drink with publican and sinners? 5:31 and
jesu answer said unto them they that are whole need not a
physician; but they that are sick

5:32 i came not to call the righteou but sinner to repent

5:33 and they said unto him whi do the discipl of john fast often
and make prayer and likewis the discipl of the pharisees; but
thine eat and drink? 5:34 and he said unto them can ye make the
children of the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom is with them?
5:35 but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then shall they fast in those day

5:36 and he spake also a parabl unto them; no man putteth a piec of
a new garment upon an old; if otherwis then both the new maketh a
rent and the piec that wa taken out of the new agreeth not with the
old

5:37 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles; els the new wine
will burst the bottl and be spill and the bottl shall perish

5:38 but new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
preserv

5:39 no man also have drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for
he saith the old is better

6:1 and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he
went through the corn fields; and hi discipl pluck the ear of
corn and did eat rub them in their hand

6:2 and certain of the pharise said unto them whi do ye that which
is not law to do on the sabbath days? 6:3 and jesu answer them
said have ye not read so much as thi what david did when himself
wa an hungr and they which were with him; 6:4 how he went into the
hous of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to
them that were with him; which it is not law to eat but for the
priest alone? 6:5 and he said unto them that the son of man is lord
also of the sabbath

6:6 and it came to pass also on anoth sabbath that he enter into
the synagogu and taught: and there wa a man whose right hand wa
wither

6:7 and the scribe and pharise watch him whether he would heal
on the sabbath day; that they might find an accus against him

6:8 but he knew their thought and said to the man which had the
wither hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he aros and
stood forth

6:9 then said jesu unto them i will ask you one thing; is it law
on the sabbath day to do good or to do evil? to save life or to
destroy it? 6:10 and look round about upon them all he said unto
the man stretch forth thi hand and he did so: and hi hand wa
restor whole as the other

6:11 and they were fill with madness; and commun one with anoth
what they might do to jesu

6:12 and it came to pass in those day that he went out into a
mountain to pray and continu all night in prayer to god

6:13 and when it wa day he call unto him hi disciples: and of
them he chose twelv whom also he name apostles; 6:14 simon (whom
he also name peter) and andrew hi brother jame and john philip
and bartholomew 6:15 matthew and thoma jame the son of alphaeu
and simon call zelot 6:16 and juda the brother of jame and
juda iscariot which also wa the traitor

6:17 and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the
compani of hi discipl and a great multitud of peopl out of all
judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which
came to hear him and to be heal of their diseases; 6:18 and they
that were vex with unclean spirits: and they were heal

6:19 and the whole multitud sought to touch him: for there went
virtu out of him and heal them all

6:20 and he lift up hi eye on hi discipl and said bless be
ye poor: for your is the kingdom of god

6:21 bless are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be fill bless
are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh

6:22 bless are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall
separ you from their compani and shall reproach you and cast out
your name as evil for the son of man sake

6:23 rejoic ye in that day and leap for joy: for behold your
reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their father
unto the prophet

6:24 but woe unto you that are rich! for ye have receiv your
consol

6:25 woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger woe unto you
that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep

6:26 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their father to the fals prophet

6:27 but i say unto you which hear love your enemi do good to them
which hate you 6:28 bless them that curs you and pray for them
which despit use you

6:29 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
other; and him that taketh away thi cloak forbid not to take thi coat
also

6:30 give to everi man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
away thi good ask them not again

6:31 and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them
likewis

6:32 for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye? for
sinner also love those that love them

6:33 and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have
ye? for sinner also do even the same

6:34 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiv what thank
have ye? for sinner also lend to sinner to receiv as much again

6:35 but love ye your enemi and do good and lend hope for
noth again; and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the
children of the highest: for he is kind unto the unthank and to the
evil

6:36 be ye therefor merci as your father also is merci

6:37 judg not and ye shall not be judged: condemn not and ye shall
not be condemned: forgiv and ye shall be forgiven: 6:38 give and it
shall be given unto you; good measur press down and shaken
togeth and run over shall men give into your bosom for with
the same measur that ye mete withal it shall be measur to you
again

6:39 and he spake a parabl unto them can the blind lead the blind?
shall they not both fall into the ditch? 6:40 the discipl is not
abov hi master: but everi one that is perfect shall be as hi
master

6:41 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother eye but
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 6:42 either how
canst thou say to thi brother brother let me pull out the mote that
is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in
thine own eye? thou hypocrit cast out first the beam out of thine
own eye and then shalt thou see clearli to pull out the mote that is
in thi brother eye

6:43 for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit

6:44 for everi tree is known by hi own fruit for of thorn men do
not gather fig nor of a brambl bush gather they grape

6:45 a good man out of the good treasur of hi heart bringeth forth
that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasur of hi
heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abund of the
heart hi mouth speaketh

6:46 and whi call ye me lord lord and do not the thing which i
say? 6:47 whosoev cometh to me and heareth my say and doeth
them i will shew you to whom he is like: 6:48 he is like a man which
built an hous and dig deep and laid the foundat on a rock:
and when the flood aros the stream beat vehement upon that hous
and could not shake it: for it wa found upon a rock

6:49 but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a
foundat built an hous upon the earth; against which the stream did
beat vehement and immedi it fell; and the ruin of that hous
wa great

7:1 now when he had end all hi say in the audienc of the
peopl he enter into capernaum

7:2 and a certain centurion servant who wa dear unto him wa
sick and readi to die

7:3 and when he heard of jesu he sent unto him the elder of the
jew beseech him that he would come and heal hi servant

7:4 and when they came to jesu they besought him instantli say
that he wa worthi for whom he should do this: 7:5 for he loveth our
nation and he hath built us a synagogu

7:6 then jesu went with them and when he wa now not far from the
hous the centurion sent friend to him say unto him lord
troubl not thyself: for i am not worthi that thou shouldest enter
under my roof: 7:7 wherefor neither thought i myself worthi to come
unto thee: but say in a word and my servant shall be heal

7:8 for i also am a man set under author have under me soldier
and i say unto one go and he goeth; and to anoth come and he
cometh; and to my servant do thi and he doeth it

7:9 when jesu heard these thing he marvel at him and turn him
about and said unto the peopl that follow him i say unto you i
have not found so great faith no not in israel

7:10 and they that were sent return to the hous found the
servant whole that had been sick

7:11 and it came to pass the day after that he went into a citi
call nain; and mani of hi discipl went with him and much peopl

7:12 now when he came nigh to the gate of the citi behold there wa
a dead man carri out the onli son of hi mother and she wa a
widow: and much peopl of the citi wa with her

7:13 and when the lord saw her he had compass on her and said
unto her weep not

7:14 and he came and touch the bier: and they that bare him stood
still

and he said young man i say unto thee aris

7:15 and he that wa dead sat up and began to speak and he deliv
him to hi mother

7:16 and there came a fear on all: and they glorifi god say
that a great prophet is risen up among us; and that god hath visit
hi peopl

7:17 and thi rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and
throughout all the region round about

7:18 and the discipl of john shew him of all these thing

7:19 and john call unto him two of hi discipl sent them to
jesu say art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
7:20 when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath
sent us unto thee say art thou he that should come? or look we
for another? 7:21 and in that same hour he cure mani of their
infirm and plagu and of evil spirits; and unto mani that were
blind he gave sight

7:22 then jesu answer said unto them go your way and tell john
what thing ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see the lame
walk the leper are cleans the deaf hear the dead are rais to
the poor the gospel is preach

7:23 and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me

7:24 and when the messeng of john were depart he began to speak
unto the peopl concern john what went ye out into the wilder
for to see? a reed shaken with the wind? 7:25 but what went ye out
for to see? a man cloth in soft raiment? behold they which are
gorgeous apparel and live delic are in king court

7:26 but what went ye out for to see? a prophet? yea i say unto you
and much more than a prophet

7:27 thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my messeng
befor thi face which shall prepar thi way befor thee

7:28 for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is
not a greater prophet than john the baptist: but he that is least in
the kingdom of god is greater than he

7:29 and all the peopl that heard him and the publican justifi
god be baptiz with the baptism of john

7:30 but the pharise and lawyer reject the counsel of god against
themselv be not baptiz of him

7:31 and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of thi
generation? and to what are they like? 7:32 they are like unto
children sit in the marketplac and call one to anoth and
say we have pipe unto you and ye have not danced; we have
mourn to you and ye have not wept

7:33 for john the baptist came neither eat bread nor drink wine;
and ye say he hath a devil

7:34 the son of man is come eat and drinking; and ye say behold a
glutton man and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinners!
7:35 but wisdom is justifi of all her children

7:36 and one of the pharise desir him that he would eat with him
and he went into the pharise hous and sat down to meat

7:37 and behold a woman in the citi which wa a sinner when she
knew that jesu sat at meat in the pharise hous brought an
alabast box of ointment 7:38 and stood at hi feet behind him
weep and began to wash hi feet with tear and did wipe them with
the hair of her head and kiss hi feet and anoint them with the
ointment

7:39 now when the pharise which had bidden him saw it he spake
within himself say thi man if he were a prophet would have
known who and what manner of woman thi is that toucheth him: for she
is a sinner

7:40 and jesu answer said unto him simon i have somewhat to say
unto thee and he saith master say on

7:41 there wa a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owe
five hundr penc and the other fifti

7:42 and when they had noth to pay he frankli forgav them both
tell me therefor which of them will love him most? 7:43 simon
answer and said i suppos that he to whom he forgav most

and he said unto him thou hast rightli judg

7:44 and he turn to the woman and said unto simon seest thou thi
woman? i enter into thine hous thou gavest me no water for my
feet: but she hath wash my feet with tear and wipe them with the
hair of her head

7:45 thou gavest me no kiss: but thi woman sinc the time i came in
hath not ceas to kiss my feet

7:46 my head with oil thou didst not anoint: but thi woman hath
anoint my feet with ointment

7:47 wherefor i say unto thee her sin which are mani are
forgiven; for she love much: but to whom littl is forgiven the same
loveth littl

7:48 and he said unto her thi sin are forgiven

7:49 and they that sat at meat with him began to say within
themselv who is thi that forgiveth sin also? 7:50 and he said to
the woman thi faith hath save thee; go in peac

8:1 and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout everi citi
and villag preach and shew the glad tide of the kingdom of
god: and the twelv were with him 8:2 and certain women which had
been heal of evil spirit and infirm mari call magdalen
out of whom went seven devil 8:3 and joanna the wife of chuza
herod steward and susanna and mani other which minist unto
him of their substanc

8:4 and when much peopl were gather togeth and were come to him
out of everi citi he spake by a parable: 8:5 a sower went out to sow
hi seed: and as he sow some fell by the way side; and it wa
trodden down and the fowl of the air devour it

8:6 and some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it wa sprung up it
wither away becaus it lack moistur

8:7 and some fell among thorns; and the thorn sprang up with it and
choke it

8:8 and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an
hundredfold and when he had said these thing he cri he that hath
ear to hear let him hear

8:9 and hi discipl ask him say what might thi parabl be?
8:10 and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the
kingdom of god: but to other in parables; that see they might not
see and hear they might not understand

8:11 now the parabl is this: the seed is the word of god

8:12 those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil
and taketh away the word out of their heart lest they should believ
and be save

8:13 they on the rock are they which when they hear receiv the
word with joy; and these have no root which for a while believ and
in time of temptat fall away

8:14 and that which fell among thorn are they which when they have
heard go forth and are choke with care and rich and pleasur of
thi life and bring no fruit to perfect

8:15 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good
heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with
patienc

8:16 no man when he hath light a candl covereth it with a vessel
or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick that they
which enter in may see the light

8:17 for noth is secret that shall not be made manifest; neither
ani thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad

8:18 take heed therefor how ye hear: for whosoev hath to him shall
be given; and whosoev hath not from him shall be taken even that
which he seemeth to have

8:19 then came to him hi mother and hi brethren and could not come
at him for the press

8:20 and it wa told him by certain which said thi mother and thi
brethren stand without desir to see thee

8:21 and he answer and said unto them my mother and my brethren are
these which hear the word of god and do it

8:22 now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship
with hi disciples: and he said unto them let us go over unto the
other side of the lake and they launch forth

8:23 but as they sail he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of
wind on the lake; and they were fill with water and were in
jeopardi

8:24 and they came to him and awok him say master master we
perish then he aros and rebuk the wind and the rage of the
water: and they ceas and there wa a calm

8:25 and he said unto them where is your faith? and they be afraid
wonder say one to anoth what manner of man is this! for he
commandeth even the wind and water and they obey him

8:26 and they arriv at the countri of the gadaren which is over
against galile

8:27 and when he went forth to land there met him out of the citi a
certain man which had devil long time and ware no cloth neither
abod in ani hous but in the tomb

8:28 when he saw jesu he cri out and fell down befor him and
with a loud voic said what have i to do with thee jesu thou son
of god most high? i beseech thee torment me not

8:29 (for he had command the unclean spirit to come out of the man
for oftentim it had caught him: and he wa kept bound with chain
and in fetters; and he brake the band and wa driven of the devil
into the wilderness) 8:30 and jesu ask him say what is thi
name? and he said legion: becaus mani devil were enter into him

8:31 and they besought him that he would not command them to go out
into the deep

8:32 and there wa there an herd of mani swine feed on the
mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter
into them and he suffer them

8:33 then went the devil out of the man and enter into the swine:
and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the lake and were
choke

8:34 when they that fed them saw what wa done they fled and went
and told it in the citi and in the countri

8:35 then they went out to see what wa done; and came to jesu and
found the man out of whom the devil were depart sit at the
feet of jesu cloth and in hi right mind: and they were afraid

8:36 they also which saw it told them by what mean he that wa
possess of the devil wa heal

8:37 then the whole multitud of the countri of the gadaren round
about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great
fear: and he went up into the ship and return back again

8:38 now the man out of whom the devil were depart besought him
that he might be with him: but jesu sent him away say 8:39
return to thine own hous and shew how great thing god hath done
unto thee and he went hi way and publish throughout the whole
citi how great thing jesu had done unto him

8:40 and it came to pass that when jesu wa return the peopl
gladli receiv him: for they were all wait for him

8:41 and behold there came a man name jairu and he wa a ruler of
the synagogue: and he fell down at jesu feet and besought him that
he would come into hi house: 8:42 for he had one onli daughter about
twelv year of age and she lay a die but as he went the peopl
throng him

8:43 and a woman have an issu of blood twelv year which had
spent all her live upon physician neither could be heal of ani
8:44 came behind him and touch the border of hi garment: and
immedi her issu of blood stanch

8:45 and jesu said who touch me? when all deni peter and they
that were with him said master the multitud throng thee and press
thee and sayest thou who touch me? 8:46 and jesu said somebodi
hath touch me: for i perceiv that virtu is gone out of me

8:47 and when the woman saw that she wa not hid she came trembl
and fall down befor him she declar unto him befor all the
peopl for what caus she had touch him and how she wa heal
immedi

8:48 and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort: thi faith
hath made thee whole; go in peac

8:49 while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogu hous say to him thi daughter is dead; troubl not
the master

8:50 but when jesu heard it he answer him say fear not:
believ onli and she shall be made whole

8:51 and when he came into the hous he suffer no man to go in
save peter and jame and john and the father and the mother of the
maiden

8:52 and all wept and bewail her: but he said weep not; she is not
dead but sleepeth

8:53 and they laugh him to scorn know that she wa dead

8:54 and he put them all out and took her by the hand and call
say maid aris

8:55 and her spirit came again and she aros straightway: and he
command to give her meat

8:56 and her parent were astonished: but he charg them that they
should tell no man what wa done

9:1 then he call hi twelv discipl togeth and gave them power
and author over all devil and to cure diseas

9:2 and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the
sick

9:3 and he said unto them take noth for your journey neither
stave nor scrip neither bread neither money; neither have two
coat apiec

9:4 and whatsoev hous ye enter into there abid and thenc
depart

9:5 and whosoev will not receiv you when ye go out of that citi
shake off the veri dust from your feet for a testimoni against them

9:6 and they depart and went through the town preach the
gospel and heal everi where

9:7 now herod the tetrarch heard of all that wa done by him: and he
wa perplex becaus that it wa said of some that john wa risen
from the dead; 9:8 and of some that elia had appeared; and of
other that one of the old prophet wa risen again

9:9 and herod said john have i beheaded: but who is thi of whom i
hear such things? and he desir to see him

9:10 and the apostl when they were return told him all that they
had done and he took them and went asid privat into a desert
place belong to the citi call bethsaida

9:11 and the peopl when they knew it follow him: and he receiv
them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and heal them that
had need of heal

9:12 and when the day began to wear away then came the twelv and
said unto him send the multitud away that they may go into the
town and countri round about and lodg and get victuals: for we are
here in a desert place

9:13 but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we
have no more but five loav and two fishes; except we should go and
buy meat for all thi peopl

9:14 for they were about five thousand men and he said to hi
discipl make them sit down by fifti in a compani

9:15 and they did so and made them all sit down

9:16 then he took the five loav and the two fish and look up
to heaven he bless them and brake and gave to the discipl to
set befor the multitud

9:17 and they did eat and were all filled: and there wa taken up of
fragment that remain to them twelv basket

9:18 and it came to pass as he wa alon pray hi discipl were
with him: and he ask them say whom say the peopl that i am?
9:19 they answer said john the baptist; but some say elias; and
other say that one of the old prophet is risen again

9:20 he said unto them but whom say ye that i am? peter answer
said the christ of god

9:21 and he straitli charg them and command them to tell no man
that thing; 9:22 say the son of man must suffer mani thing and
be reject of the elder and chief priest and scribe and be slain
and be rais the third day

9:23 and he said to them all if ani man will come after me let him
deni himself and take up hi cross daili and follow me

9:24 for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it: but whosoev
will lose hi life for my sake the same shall save it

9:25 for what is a man advantag if he gain the whole world and
lose himself or be cast away? 9:26 for whosoev shall be asham of
me and of my word of him shall the son of man be asham when he
shall come in hi own glori and in hi father and of the holi
angel

9:27 but i tell you of a truth there be some stand here which
shall not tast of death till they see the kingdom of god

9:28 and it came to pass about an eight day after these say he
took peter and john and jame and went up into a mountain to pray

9:29 and as he pray the fashion of hi counten wa alter and
hi raiment wa white and glister

9:30 and behold there talk with him two men which were mose and
elias: 9:31 who appear in glori and spake of hi deceas which he
should accomplish at jerusalem

9:32 but peter and they that were with him were heavi with sleep: and
when they were awak they saw hi glori and the two men that stood
with him

9:33 and it came to pass as they depart from him peter said unto
jesu master it is good for us to be here: and let us make three
tabernacles; one for thee and one for mose and one for elias: not
know what he said

9:34 while he thu spake there came a cloud and overshadow them:
and they fear as they enter into the cloud

9:35 and there came a voic out of the cloud say thi is my
belov son: hear him

9:36 and when the voic wa past jesu wa found alon and they kept
it close and told no man in those day ani of those thing which they
had seen

9:37 and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come
down from the hill much peopl met him

9:38 and behold a man of the compani cri out say master i
beseech thee look upon my son: for he is mine onli child

9:39 and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenli crieth out; and it
teareth him that he foameth again and bruis him hardli departeth
from him

9:40 and i besought thi discipl to cast him out; and they could not

9:41 and jesu answer said o faithless and pervers gener
how long shall i be with you and suffer you? bring thi son hither

9:42 and as he wa yet a come the devil threw him down and tare
him

and jesu rebuk the unclean spirit and heal the child and
deliv him again to hi father

9:43 and they were all amaz at the mighti power of god but while
they wonder everi one at all thing which jesu did he said unto
hi discipl 9:44 let these say sink down into your ears: for
the son of man shall be deliv into the hand of men

9:45 but they understood not thi say and it wa hid from them
that they perceiv it not: and they fear to ask him of that say

9:46 then there aros a reason among them which of them should be
greatest

9:47 and jesu perceiv the thought of their heart took a child
and set him by him 9:48 and said unto them whosoev shall receiv
thi child in my name receiveth me: and whosoev shall receiv me
receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all the
same shall be great

9:49 and john answer and said master we saw one cast out devil
in thi name; and we forbad him becaus he followeth not with us

9:50 and jesu said unto him forbid him not: for he that is not
against us is for us

9:51 and it came to pass when the time wa come that he should be
receiv up he stedfastli set hi face to go to jerusalem 9:52 and
sent messeng befor hi face: and they went and enter into a
villag of the samaritan to make readi for him

9:53 and they did not receiv him becaus hi face wa as though he
would go to jerusalem

9:54 and when hi discipl jame and john saw thi they said lord
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consum
them even as elia did? 9:55 but he turn and rebuk them and
said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of

9:56 for the son of man is not come to destroy men live but to
save them and they went to anoth villag

9:57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man
said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest

9:58 and jesu said unto him fox have hole and bird of the air
have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay hi head

9:59 and he said unto anoth follow me but he said lord suffer me
first to go and buri my father

9:60 jesu said unto him let the dead buri their dead: but go thou
and preach the kingdom of god

9:61 and anoth also said lord i will follow thee; but let me first
go bid them farewel which are at home at my hous

9:62 and jesu said unto him no man have put hi hand to the
plough and look back is fit for the kingdom of god

10:1 after these thing the lord appoint other seventi also and
sent them two and two befor hi face into everi citi and place
whither he himself would come

10:2 therefor said he unto them the harvest truli is great but the
labour are few: pray ye therefor the lord of the harvest that he
would send forth labour into hi harvest

10:3 go your ways: behold i send you forth as lamb among wolv

10:4 carri neither purs nor scrip nor shoes: and salut no man by
the way

10:5 and into whatsoev hous ye enter first say peac be to thi
hous

10:6 and if the son of peac be there your peac shall rest upon it:
if not it shall turn to you again

10:7 and in the same hous remain eat and drink such thing as
they give: for the labour is worthi of hi hire go not from hous
to hous

10:8 and into whatsoev citi ye enter and they receiv you eat such
thing as are set befor you: 10:9 and heal the sick that are therein
and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you

10:10 but into whatsoev citi ye enter and they receiv you not go
your way out into the street of the same and say 10:11 even the
veri dust of your citi which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against
you: notwithstand be ye sure of thi that the kingdom of god is
come nigh unto you

10:12 but i say unto you that it shall be more toler in that day
for sodom than for that citi

10:13 woe unto thee chorazin! woe unto thee bethsaida! for if the
mighti work had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in
you they had a great while ago repent sit in sackcloth and
ash

10:14 but it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the
judgment than for you

10:15 and thou capernaum which art exalt to heaven shalt be
thrust down to hell

10:16 he that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me

10:17 and the seventi return again with joy say lord even the
devil are subject unto us through thi name

10:18 and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightn fall from
heaven

10:19 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpent and
scorpion and over all the power of the enemy: and noth shall by
ani mean hurt you

10:20 notwithstand in thi rejoic not that the spirit are
subject unto you; but rather rejoic becaus your name are written
in heaven

10:21 in that hour jesu rejoic in spirit and said i thank thee o
father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these thing from
the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babes: even so
father; for so it seem good in thi sight

10:22 all thing are deliv to me of my father: and no man knoweth
who the son is but the father; and who the father is but the son
and he to whom the son will reveal him

10:23 and he turn him unto hi discipl and said privat
bless are the eye which see the thing that ye see: 10:24 for i
tell you that mani prophet and king have desir to see those
thing which ye see and have not seen them; and to hear those thing
which ye hear and have not heard them

10:25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempt him say
master what shall i do to inherit etern life? 10:26 he said unto
him what is written in the law? how readest thou? 10:27 and he
answer said thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi heart
and with all thi soul and with all thi strength and with all thi
mind; and thi neighbour as thyself

10:28 and he said unto him thou hast answer right: thi do and
thou shalt live

10:29 but he will to justifi himself said unto jesu and who is
my neighbour? 10:30 and jesu answer said a certain man went down
from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thiev which strip him
of hi raiment and wound him and depart leav him half dead

10:31 and by chanc there came down a certain priest that way: and
when he saw him he pass by on the other side

10:32 and likewis a levit when he wa at the place came and look
on him and pass by on the other side

10:33 but a certain samaritan as he journey came where he was: and
when he saw him he had compass on him 10:34 and went to him and
bound up hi wound pour in oil and wine and set him on hi own
beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him

10:35 and on the morrow when he depart he took out two penc and
gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him; and
whatsoev thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee

10:36 which now of these three thinkest thou wa neighbour unto him
that fell among the thieves? 10:37 and he said he that shew merci
on him then said jesu unto him go and do thou likewis

10:38 now it came to pass as they went that he enter into a
certain village: and a certain woman name martha receiv him into
her hous

10:39 and she had a sister call mari which also sat at jesu feet
and heard hi word

10:40 but martha wa cumber about much serv and came to him and
said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serv
alone? bid her therefor that she help me

10:41 and jesu answer and said unto her martha martha thou art
care and troubl about mani things: 10:42 but one thing is
needful: and mari hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken
away from her

11:1 and it came to pass that as he wa pray in a certain place
when he ceas one of hi discipl said unto him lord teach us to
pray as john also taught hi discipl

11:2 and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in
heaven hallow be thi name thi kingdom come thi will be done as
in heaven so in earth

11:3 give us day by day our daili bread

11:4 and forgiv us our sins; for we also forgiv everi one that is
indebt to us and lead us not into temptation; but deliv us from
evil

11:5 and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and
shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three
loaves; 11:6 for a friend of mine in hi journey is come to me and i
have noth to set befor him? 11:7 and he from within shall answer
and say troubl me not: the door is now shut and my children are
with me in bed; i cannot rise and give thee

11:8 i say unto you though he will not rise and give him becaus he
is hi friend yet becaus of hi importun he will rise and give
him as mani as he needeth

11:9 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye
shall find; knock and it shall be open unto you

11:10 for everi one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be open

11:11 if a son shall ask bread of ani of you that is a father will he
give him a stone? or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a
serpent? 11:12 or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a
scorpion? 11:13 if ye then be evil know how to give good gift
unto your children: how much more shall your heavenli father give the
holi spirit to them that ask him? 11:14 and he wa cast out a
devil and it wa dumb and it came to pass when the devil wa gone
out the dumb spake; and the peopl wonder

11:15 but some of them said he casteth out devil through beelzebub
the chief of the devil

11:16 and other tempt him sought of him a sign from heaven

11:17 but he know their thought said unto them everi kingdom
divid against itself is brought to desolation; and a hous divid
against a hous falleth

11:18 if satan also be divid against himself how shall hi kingdom
stand? becaus ye say that i cast out devil through beelzebub

11:19 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your son cast
them out? therefor shall they be your judg

11:20 but if i with the finger of god cast out devil no doubt the
kingdom of god is come upon you

11:21 when a strong man arm keepeth hi palac hi good are in
peace: 11:22 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and
overcom him he taketh from him all hi armour wherein he trust
and divideth hi spoil

11:23 he that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth

11:24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
dri place seek rest; and find none he saith i will return
unto my hous whenc i came out

11:25 and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnish

11:26 then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirit more wick
than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state
of that man is wors than the first

11:27 and it came to pass as he spake these thing a certain woman
of the compani lift up her voic and said unto him bless is the
womb that bare thee and the pap which thou hast suck

11:28 but he said yea rather bless are they that hear the word of
god and keep it

11:29 and when the peopl were gather thick togeth he began to
say thi is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no
sign be given it but the sign of jona the prophet

11:30 for as jona wa a sign unto the ninevit so shall also the
son of man be to thi gener

11:31 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
men of thi gener and condemn them: for she came from the utmost
part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and behold a
greater than solomon is here

11:32 the men of ninev shall rise up in the judgment with thi
gener and shall condemn it: for they repent at the preach
of jonas; and behold a greater than jona is here

11:33 no man when he hath light a candl putteth it in a secret
place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which
come in may see the light

11:34 the light of the bodi is the eye: therefor when thine eye is
singl thi whole bodi also is full of light; but when thine eye is
evil thi bodi also is full of dark

11:35 take heed therefor that the light which is in thee be not
dark

11:36 if thi whole bodi therefor be full of light have no part
dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shine of
a candl doth give thee light

11:37 and as he spake a certain pharise besought him to dine with
him: and he went in and sat down to meat

11:38 and when the pharise saw it he marvel that he had not first
wash befor dinner

11:39 and the lord said unto him now do ye pharise make clean the
outsid of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of
raven and wicked

11:40 ye fool did not he that made that which is without make that
which is within also? 11:41 but rather give alm of such thing as ye
have; and behold all thing are clean unto you

11:42 but woe unto you pharisees! for ye tith mint and rue and all
manner of herb and pass over judgment and the love of god: these
ought ye to have done and not to leav the other undon

11:43 woe unto you pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seat in the
synagogu and greet in the market

11:44 woe unto you scribe and pharise hypocrites! for ye are as
grave which appear not and the men that walk over them are not awar
of them

11:45 then answer one of the lawyer and said unto him master
thu say thou reproachest us also

11:46 and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
burden grievou to be born and ye yourselv touch not the burden
with one of your finger

11:47 woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchr of the prophet and
your father kill them

11:48 truli ye bear wit that ye allow the deed of your fathers:
for they inde kill them and ye build their sepulchr

11:49 therefor also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophet
and apostl and some of them they shall slay and persecute: 11:50
that the blood of all the prophet which wa shed from the foundat
of the world may be requir of thi generation; 11:51 from the blood
of abel unto the blood of zacharia which perish between the altar
and the temple: verili i say unto you it shall be requir of thi
gener

11:52 woe unto you lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
knowledge: ye enter not in yourselv and them that were enter
in ye hinder

11:53 and as he said these thing unto them the scribe and the
pharise began to urg him vehement and to provok him to speak of
mani things: 11:54 lay wait for him and seek to catch someth
out of hi mouth that they might accus him

12:1 in the mean time when there were gather togeth an
innumer multitud of peopl insomuch that they trode one upon
anoth he began to say unto hi discipl first of all bewar ye of
the leaven of the pharise which is hypocrisi

12:2 for there is noth cover that shall not be revealed; neither
hid that shall not be known

12:3 therefor whatsoev ye have spoken in dark shall be heard in
the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closet shall
be proclaim upon the housetop

12:4 and i say unto you my friend be not afraid of them that kill
the bodi and after that have no more that they can do

12:5 but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: fear him which after
he hath kill hath power to cast into hell; yea i say unto you fear
him

12:6 are not five sparrow sold for two farth and not one of them
is forgotten befor god? 12:7 but even the veri hair of your head
are all number fear not therefore: ye are of more valu than mani
sparrow

12:8 also i say unto you whosoev shall confess me befor men him
shall the son of man also confess befor the angel of god: 12:9 but
he that denieth me befor men shall be deni befor the angel of
god

12:10 and whosoev shall speak a word against the son of man it
shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the holi
ghost it shall not be forgiven

12:11 and when they bring you unto the synagogu and unto
magistr and power take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer or what ye shall say: 12:12 for the holi ghost shall teach you
in the same hour what ye ought to say

12:13 and one of the compani said unto him master speak to my
brother that he divid the inherit with me

12:14 and he said unto him man who made me a judg or a divid over
you? 12:15 and he said unto them take heed and bewar of
covetousness: for a man life consisteth not in the abund of the
thing which he possesseth

12:16 and he spake a parabl unto them say the ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 12:17 and he thought
within himself say what shall i do becaus i have no room where
to bestow my fruits? 12:18 and he said thi will i do: i will pull
down my barn and build greater; and there will i bestow all my
fruit and my good

12:19 and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much good laid up
for mani years; take thine eas eat drink and be merri

12:20 but god said unto him thou fool thi night thi soul shall be
requir of thee: then whose shall those thing be which thou hast
provided? 12:21 so is he that layeth up treasur for himself and is
not rich toward god

12:22 and he said unto hi discipl therefor i say unto you take
no thought for your life what ye shall eat; neither for the bodi
what ye shall put on

12:23 the life is more than meat and the bodi is more than raiment

12:24 consid the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
neither have storehous nor barn; and god feedeth them: how much more
are ye better than the fowls? 12:25 and which of you with take
thought can add to hi statur one cubit? 12:26 if ye then be not
abl to do that thing which is least whi take ye thought for the
rest? 12:27 consid the lili how they grow: they toil not they
spin not; and yet i say unto you that solomon in all hi glori wa
not array like one of these

12:28 if then god so cloth the grass which is to day in the field
and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he cloth you
o ye of littl faith? 12:29 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or
what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubt mind

12:30 for all these thing do the nation of the world seek after: and
your father knoweth that ye have need of these thing

12:31 but rather seek ye the kingdom of god; and all these thing
shall be ad unto you

12:32 fear not littl flock; for it is your father good pleasur to
give you the kingdom

12:33 sell that ye have and give alms; provid yourselv bag which
wax not old a treasur in the heaven that faileth not where no
thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth

12:34 for where your treasur is there will your heart be also

12:35 let your loin be gird about and your light burning; 12:36
and ye yourselv like unto men that wait for their lord when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh they may
open unto him immedi

12:37 bless are those servant whom the lord when he cometh shall
find watching: verili i say unto you that he shall gird himself and
make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serv them

12:38 and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third
watch and find them so bless are those servant

12:39 and thi know that if the goodman of the hous had known what
hour the thief would come he would have watch and not have
suffer hi hous to be broken through

12:40 be ye therefor readi also: for the son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not

12:41 then peter said unto him lord speakest thou thi parabl unto
us or even to all? 12:42 and the lord said who then is that
faith and wise steward whom hi lord shall make ruler over hi
household to give them their portion of meat in due season? 12:43
bless is that servant whom hi lord when he cometh shall find so
do

12:44 of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all
that he hath

12:45 but and if that servant say in hi heart my lord delayeth hi
coming; and shall begin to beat the menserv and maiden and to
eat and drink and to be drunken; 12:46 the lord of that servant will
come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is
not awar and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him hi
portion with the unbeliev

12:47 and that servant which knew hi lord will and prepar not
himself neither did accord to hi will shall be beaten with mani
stripe

12:48 but he that knew not and did commit thing worthi of stripe
shall be beaten with few stripe for unto whomsoev much is given
of him shall be much required: and to whom men have commit much of
him they will ask the more

12:49 i am come to send fire on the earth; and what will i if it be
alreadi kindled? 12:50 but i have a baptism to be baptiz with; and
how am i straiten till it be accomplished! 12:51 suppos ye that i
am come to give peac on earth? i tell you nay; but rather division:
12:52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one hous divid
three against two and two against three

12:53 the father shall be divid against the son and the son against
the father; the mother against the daughter and the daughter against
the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law and the
daughter in law against her mother in law

12:54 and he said also to the peopl when ye see a cloud rise out of
the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower; and so it is

12:55 and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat;
and it cometh to pass

12:56 ye hypocrit ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
earth; but how is it that ye do not discern thi time? 12:57 yea and
whi even of yourselv judg ye not what is right? 12:58 when thou
goest with thine adversari to the magistr as thou art in the way
give dilig that thou mayest be deliv from him; lest he hale
thee to the judg and the judg deliv thee to the offic and the
offic cast thee into prison

12:59 i tell thee thou shalt not depart thenc till thou hast paid
the veri last mite

13:1 there were present at that season some that told him of the
galilaean whose blood pilat had mingl with their sacrific

13:2 and jesu answer said unto them suppos ye that these
galilaean were sinner abov all the galilaean becaus they
suffer such things? 13:3 i tell you nay: but except ye repent ye
shall all likewis perish

13:4 or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew
them think ye that they were sinner abov all men that dwelt in
jerusalem? 13:5 i tell you nay: but except ye repent ye shall all
likewis perish

13:6 he spake also thi parable; a certain man had a fig tree plant
in hi vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none

13:7 then said he unto the dresser of hi vineyard behold these
three year i come seek fruit on thi fig tree and find none: cut
it down; whi cumbereth it the ground? 13:8 and he answer said unto
him lord let it alon thi year also till i shall dig about it and
dung it: 13:9 and if it bear fruit well: and if not then after that
thou shalt cut it down

13:10 and he wa teach in one of the synagogu on the sabbath

13:11 and behold there wa a woman which had a spirit of infirm
eighteen year and wa bow togeth and could in no wise lift up
herself

13:12 and when jesu saw her he call her to him and said unto her
woman thou art loos from thine infirm

13:13 and he laid hi hand on her: and immedi she wa made
straight and glorifi god

13:14 and the ruler of the synagogu answer with indign
becaus that jesu had heal on the sabbath day and said unto the
peopl there are six day in which men ought to work: in them
therefor come and be heal and not on the sabbath day

13:15 the lord then answer him and said thou hypocrit doth not
each one of you on the sabbath loos hi ox or hi ass from the stall
and lead him away to watering? 13:16 and ought not thi woman be
a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen
year be loos from thi bond on the sabbath day? 13:17 and when he
had said these thing all hi adversari were ashamed: and all the
peopl rejoic for all the gloriou thing that were done by him

13:18 then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like? and
whereunto shall i resembl it? 13:19 it is like a grain of mustard
seed which a man took and cast into hi garden; and it grew and
wax a great tree; and the fowl of the air lodg in the branch of
it

13:20 and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god?
13:21 it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur
of meal till the whole wa leaven

13:22 and he went through the citi and villag teach and
journey toward jerusalem

13:23 then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved? and
he said unto them 13:24 strive to enter in at the strait gate: for
mani i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be abl

13:25 when onc the master of the hous is risen up and hath shut to
the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door
say lord lord open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto
you i know you not whenc ye are: 13:26 then shall ye begin to say
we have eaten and drunk in thi presenc and thou hast taught in our
street

13:27 but he shall say i tell you i know you not whenc ye are;
depart from me all ye worker of iniqu

13:28 there shall be weep and gnash of teeth when ye shall see
abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophet in the kingdom of
god and you yourselv thrust out

13:29 and they shall come from the east and from the west and from
the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of
god

13:30 and behold there are last which shall be first and there are
first which shall be last

13:31 the same day there came certain of the pharise say unto
him get thee out and depart hence: for herod will kill thee

13:32 and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast
out devil and i do cure to day and to morrow and the third day i
shall be perfect

13:33 nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day
following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem

13:34 o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophet and stonest
them that are sent unto thee; how often would i have gather thi
children togeth as a hen doth gather her brood under her wing and
ye would not! 13:35 behold your hous is left unto you desolate: and
verili i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when
ye shall say bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord

14:1 and it came to pass as he went into the hous of one of the
chief pharise to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watch
him

14:2 and behold there wa a certain man befor him which had the
dropsi

14:3 and jesu answer spake unto the lawyer and pharise say
is it law to heal on the sabbath day? 14:4 and they held their
peac and he took him and heal him and let him go; 14:5 and
answer them say which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen
into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
14:6 and they could not answer him again to these thing

14:7 and he put forth a parabl to those which were bidden when he
mark how they chose out the chief rooms; say unto them

14:8 when thou art bidden of ani man to a wed sit not down in the
highest room; lest a more honour man than thou be bidden of him;
14:9 and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give thi man
place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room

14:10 but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room;
that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go
up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presenc of them that
sit at meat with thee

14:11 for whosoev exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalt

14:12 then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a
dinner or a supper call not thi friend nor thi brethren neither
thi kinsmen nor thi rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again
and a recomp be made thee

14:13 but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maim the
lame the blind: 14:14 and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
recompens thee: for thou shalt be recompens at the resurrect of
the just

14:15 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
thing he said unto him bless is he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of god

14:16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and
bade many: 14:17 and sent hi servant at supper time to say to them
that were bidden come; for all thing are now readi

14:18 and they all with one consent began to make excus the first
said unto him i have bought a piec of ground and i must need go
and see it: i pray thee have me excus

14:19 and anoth said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to
prove them: i pray thee have me excus

14:20 and anoth said i have marri a wife and therefor i cannot
come

14:21 so that servant came and shew hi lord these thing then the
master of the hous be angri said to hi servant go out quickli
into the street and lane of the citi and bring in hither the poor
and the maim and the halt and the blind

14:22 and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast command
and yet there is room

14:23 and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highway and
hedg and compel them to come in that my hous may be fill

14:24 for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden
shall tast of my supper

14:25 and there went great multitud with him: and he turn and
said unto them 14:26 if ani man come to me and hate not hi father
and mother and wife and children and brethren and sister yea
and hi own life also he cannot be my discipl

14:27 and whosoev doth not bear hi cross and come after me cannot
be my discipl

14:28 for which of you intend to build a tower sitteth not down
first and counteth the cost whether he have suffici to finish it?
14:29 lest hapli after he hath laid the foundat and is not abl
to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him 14:30 say thi
man began to build and wa not abl to finish

14:31 or what king go to make war against anoth king sitteth
not down first and consulteth whether he be abl with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him with twenti thousand? 14:32 or els
while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassag and
desireth condit of peac

14:33 so likewis whosoev he be of you that forsaketh not all that
he hath he cannot be my discipl

14:34 salt is good: but if the salt have lost hi savour wherewith
shall it be seasoned? 14:35 it is neither fit for the land nor yet
for the dunghill; but men cast it out he that hath ear to hear let
him hear

15:1 then drew near unto him all the publican and sinner for to hear
him

15:2 and the pharise and scribe murmur say thi man
receiveth sinner and eateth with them

15:3 and he spake thi parabl unto them say 15:4 what man of
you have an hundr sheep if he lose one of them doth not leav
the nineti and nine in the wilder and go after that which is
lost until he find it? 15:5 and when he hath found it he layeth it
on hi shoulder rejoic

15:6 and when he cometh home he calleth togeth hi friend and
neighbour say unto them rejoic with me; for i have found my
sheep which wa lost

15:7 i say unto you that likewis joy shall be in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth more than over nineti and nine just person
which need no repent

15:8 either what woman have ten piec of silver if she lose one
piec doth not light a candl and sweep the hous and seek
dilig till she find it? 15:9 and when she hath found it she
calleth her friend and her neighbour togeth say rejoic with
me; for i have found the piec which i had lost

15:10 likewis i say unto you there is joy in the presenc of the
angel of god over one sinner that repenteth

15:11 and he said a certain man had two sons: 15:12 and the younger
of them said to hi father father give me the portion of good that
falleth to me and he divid unto them hi live

15:13 and not mani day after the younger son gather all togeth
and took hi journey into a far countri and there wast hi
substanc with riotou live

15:14 and when he had spent all there aros a mighti famin in that
land; and he began to be in want

15:15 and he went and join himself to a citizen of that country; and
he sent him into hi field to feed swine

15:16 and he would fain have fill hi belli with the husk that the
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him

15:17 and when he came to himself he said how mani hire servant of
my father have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger!
15:18 i will aris and go to my father and will say unto him father
i have sin against heaven and befor thee 15:19 and am no more
worthi to be call thi son: make me as one of thi hire servant

15:20 and he aros and came to hi father but when he wa yet a
great way off hi father saw him and had compass and ran and
fell on hi neck and kiss him

15:21 and the son said unto him father i have sin against heaven
and in thi sight and am no more worthi to be call thi son

15:22 but the father said to hi servant bring forth the best robe
and put it on him; and put a ring on hi hand and shoe on hi feet:
15:23 and bring hither the fat calf and kill it; and let us eat
and be merry: 15:24 for thi my son wa dead and is aliv again; he
wa lost and is found and they began to be merri

15:25 now hi elder son wa in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
to the hous he heard musick and danc

15:26 and he call one of the servant and ask what these thing
meant

15:27 and he said unto him thi brother is come; and thi father hath
kill the fat calf becaus he hath receiv him safe and sound

15:28 and he wa angri and would not go in: therefor came hi father
out and intreat him

15:29 and he answer said to hi father lo these mani year do i
serv thee neither transgress i at ani time thi commandment: and
yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merri with my
friends: 15:30 but as soon as thi thi son wa come which hath
devour thi live with harlot thou hast kill for him the fat
calf

15:31 and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i
have is thine

15:32 it wa meet that we should make merri and be glad: for thi thi
brother wa dead and is aliv again; and wa lost and is found

16:1 and he said also unto hi discipl there wa a certain rich
man which had a steward; and the same wa accus unto him that he
had wast hi good

16:2 and he call him and said unto him how is it that i hear thi
of thee? give an account of thi stewardship; for thou mayest be no
longer steward

16:3 then the steward said within himself what shall i do? for my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship: i cannot dig; to beg i am
asham

16:4 i am resolv what to do that when i am put out of the
stewardship they may receiv me into their hous

16:5 so he call everi one of hi lord debtor unto him and said
unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord? 16:6 and he said
an hundr measur of oil and he said unto him take thi bill and
sit down quickli and write fifti

16:7 then said he to anoth and how much owest thou? and he said an
hundr measur of wheat and he said unto him take thi bill and
write fourscor

16:8 and the lord commend the unjust steward becaus he had done
wisely: for the children of thi world are in their gener wiser
than the children of light

16:9 and i say unto you make to yourselv friend of the mammon of
unrighteousness; that when ye fail they may receiv you into
everlast habit

16:10 he that is faith in that which is least is faith also in
much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much

16:11 if therefor ye have not been faith in the unright
mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches? 16:12 and if
ye have not been faith in that which is anoth man who shall
give you that which is your own? 16:13 no servant can serv two
masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other; or els
he will hold to the one and despis the other ye cannot serv god
and mammon

16:14 and the pharise also who were covet heard all these
things: and they derid him

16:15 and he said unto them ye are they which justifi yourselv
befor men; but god knoweth your hearts: for that which is highli
esteem among men is abomin in the sight of god

16:16 the law and the prophet were until john: sinc that time the
kingdom of god is preach and everi man presseth into it

16:17 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittl
of the law to fail

16:18 whosoev putteth away hi wife and marrieth anoth
committeth adultery: and whosoev marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adulteri

16:19 there wa a certain rich man which wa cloth in purpl and
fine linen and fare sumptuous everi day: 16:20 and there wa a
certain beggar name lazaru which wa laid at hi gate full of
sore 16:21 and desir to be fed with the crumb which fell from
the rich man table: moreov the dog came and lick hi sore

16:22 and it came to pass that the beggar die and wa carri by
the angel into abraham bosom: the rich man also die and wa
buried; 16:23 and in hell he lift up hi eye be in torment and
seeth abraham afar off and lazaru in hi bosom

16:24 and he cri and said father abraham have merci on me and
send lazaru that he may dip the tip of hi finger in water and cool
my tongue; for i am torment in thi flame

16:25 but abraham said son rememb that thou in thi lifetim
receivedst thi good thing and likewis lazaru evil things: but now
he is comfort and thou art torment

16:26 and besid all thi between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed: so that they which would pass from henc to you cannot; neither
can they pass to us that would come from thenc

16:27 then he said i pray thee therefor father that thou wouldest
send him to my father house: 16:28 for i have five brethren; that he
may testifi unto them lest they also come into thi place of torment

16:29 abraham saith unto him they have mose and the prophets; let
them hear them

16:30 and he said nay father abraham: but if one went unto them from
the dead they will repent

16:31 and he said unto him if they hear not mose and the prophet
neither will they be persuad though one rose from the dead

17:1 then said he unto the discipl it is imposs but that
offenc will come: but woe unto him through whom they come! 17:2 it
were better for him that a millston were hang about hi neck and
he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these littl
one

17:3 take heed to yourselves: if thi brother trespass against thee
rebuk him; and if he repent forgiv him

17:4 and if he trespass against thee seven time in a day and seven
time in a day turn again to thee say i repent; thou shalt
forgiv him

17:5 and the apostl said unto the lord increas our faith

17:6 and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
might say unto thi sycamin tree be thou pluck up by the root and
be thou plant in the sea; and it should obey you

17:7 but which of you have a servant plow or feed cattl
will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and
sit down to meat? 17:8 and will not rather say unto him make readi
wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serv me till i have eaten
and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 17:9 doth he
thank that servant becaus he did the thing that were command him?
i trow not

17:10 so likewis ye when ye shall have done all those thing which
are command you say we are unprofit servants: we have done
that which wa our duti to do

17:11 and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he pass
through the midst of samaria and galile

17:12 and as he enter into a certain villag there met him ten men
that were leper which stood afar off: 17:13 and they lift up their
voic and said jesu master have merci on us

17:14 and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselv unto
the priest and it came to pass that as they went they were
cleans

17:15 and one of them when he saw that he wa heal turn back
and with a loud voic glorifi god 17:16 and fell down on hi face
at hi feet give him thanks: and he wa a samaritan

17:17 and jesu answer said were there not ten cleansed? but where
are the nine? 17:18 there are not found that return to give glori
to god save thi stranger

17:19 and he said unto him aris go thi way: thi faith hath made
thee whole

17:20 and when he wa demand of the pharise when the kingdom of
god should come he answer them and said the kingdom of god cometh
not with observation: 17:21 neither shall they say lo here! or lo
there! for behold the kingdom of god is within you

17:22 and he said unto the discipl the day will come when ye
shall desir to see one of the day of the son of man and ye shall
not see it

17:23 and they shall say to you see here; or see there: go not after
them nor follow them

17:24 for as the lightn that lighteneth out of the one part under
heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the
son of man be in hi day

17:25 but first must he suffer mani thing and be reject of thi
gener

17:26 and as it wa in the day of noe so shall it be also in the
day of the son of man

17:27 they did eat they drank they marri wive they were given in
marriag until the day that noe enter into the ark and the flood
came and destroy them all

17:28 likewis also as it wa in the day of lot; they did eat they
drank they bought they sold they plant they builded; 17:29 but
the same day that lot went out of sodom it rain fire and brimston
from heaven and destroy them all

17:30 even thu shall it be in the day when the son of man is
reveal

17:31 in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and hi stuff
in the hous let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in
the field let him likewis not return back

17:32 rememb lot wife

17:33 whosoev shall seek to save hi life shall lose it; and
whosoev shall lose hi life shall preserv it

17:34 i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the
one shall be taken and the other shall be left

17:35 two women shall be grind together; the one shall be taken
and the other left

17:36 two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken and the
other left

17:37 and they answer and said unto him where lord? and he said
unto them wheresoev the bodi is thither will the eagl be
gather togeth

18:1 and he spake a parabl unto them to thi end that men ought
alway to pray and not to faint; 18:2 say there wa in a citi a
judg which fear not god neither regard man: 18:3 and there wa
a widow in that city; and she came unto him say aveng me of mine
adversari

18:4 and he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
himself though i fear not god nor regard man; 18:5 yet becaus thi
widow troubleth me i will aveng her lest by her continu come
she weari me

18:6 and the lord said hear what the unjust judg saith

18:7 and shall not god aveng hi own elect which cri day and night
unto him though he bear long with them? 18:8 i tell you that he will
aveng them speedili nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall
he find faith on the earth? 18:9 and he spake thi parabl unto
certain which trust in themselv that they were righteou and
despis others: 18:10 two men went up into the templ to pray; the
one a pharise and the other a publican

18:11 the pharise stood and pray thu with himself god i thank
thee that i am not as other men are extortion unjust
adulter or even as thi publican

18:12 i fast twice in the week i give tith of all that i possess

18:13 and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much
as hi eye unto heaven but smote upon hi breast say god be
merci to me a sinner

18:14 i tell you thi man went down to hi hous justifi rather
than the other: for everi one that exalteth himself shall be abased;
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt

18:15 and they brought unto him also infant that he would touch
them: but when hi discipl saw it they rebuk them

18:16 but jesu call them unto him and said suffer littl children
to come unto me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
god

18:17 verili i say unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom
of god as a littl child shall in no wise enter therein

18:18 and a certain ruler ask him say good master what shall i
do to inherit etern life? 18:19 and jesu said unto him whi
callest thou me good? none is good save one that is god

18:20 thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not
kill do not steal do not bear fals wit honour thi father and
thi mother

18:21 and he said all these have i kept from my youth up

18:22 now when jesu heard these thing he said unto him yet lackest
thou one thing: sell all that thou hast and distribut unto the poor
and thou shalt have treasur in heaven: and come follow me

18:23 and when he heard thi he wa veri sorrowful: for he wa veri
rich

18:24 and when jesu saw that he wa veri sorrow he said how
hardli shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god!
18:25 for it is easier for a camel to go through a needl eye than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god

18:26 and they that heard it said who then can be saved? 18:27 and
he said the thing which are imposs with men are possibl with
god

18:28 then peter said lo we have left all and follow thee

18:29 and he said unto them verili i say unto you there is no man
that hath left hous or parent or brethren or wife or children
for the kingdom of god sake 18:30 who shall not receiv manifold
more in thi present time and in the world to come life everlast

18:31 then he took unto him the twelv and said unto them behold we
go up to jerusalem and all thing that are written by the prophet
concern the son of man shall be accomplish

18:32 for he shall be deliv unto the gentil and shall be
mock and spite entreat and spit on: 18:33 and they shall
scourg him and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise
again

18:34 and they understood none of these things: and thi say wa
hid from them neither knew they the thing which were spoken

18:35 and it came to pass that as he wa come nigh unto jericho a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 18:36 and hear the
multitud pass by he ask what it meant

18:37 and they told him that jesu of nazareth passeth by

18:38 and he cri say jesu thou son of david have merci on
me

18:39 and they which went befor rebuk him that he should hold hi
peace: but he cri so much the more thou son of david have merci on
me

18:40 and jesu stood and command him to be brought unto him: and
when he wa come near he ask him 18:41 say what wilt thou that
i shall do unto thee? and he said lord that i may receiv my sight

18:42 and jesu said unto him receiv thi sight: thi faith hath save
thee

18:43 and immedi he receiv hi sight and follow him
glorifi god: and all the peopl when they saw it gave prais unto
god

19:1 and jesu enter and pass through jericho

19:2 and behold there wa a man name zacchaeu which wa the chief
among the publican and he wa rich

19:3 and he sought to see jesu who he was; and could not for the
press becaus he wa littl of statur

19:4 and he ran befor and climb up into a sycomor tree to see
him: for he wa to pass that way

19:5 and when jesu came to the place he look up and saw him and
said unto him zacchaeu make hast and come down; for to day i must
abid at thi hous

19:6 and he made hast and came down and receiv him joy

19:7 and when they saw it they all murmur say that he wa gone
to be guest with a man that is a sinner

19:8 and zacchaeu stood and said unto the lord: behold lord the
half of my good i give to the poor; and if i have taken ani thing
from ani man by fals accus i restor him fourfold

19:9 and jesu said unto him thi day is salvat come to thi
hous forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham

19:10 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which wa
lost

19:11 and as they heard these thing he ad and spake a parabl
becaus he wa nigh to jerusalem and becaus they thought that the
kingdom of god should immedi appear

19:12 he said therefor a certain nobleman went into a far countri to
receiv for himself a kingdom and to return

19:13 and he call hi ten servant and deliv them ten pound
and said unto them occupi till i come

19:14 but hi citizen hate him and sent a messag after him
say we will not have thi man to reign over us

19:15 and it came to pass that when he wa return have receiv
the kingdom then he command these servant to be call unto him
to whom he had given the money that he might know how much everi man
had gain by trade

19:16 then came the first say lord thi pound hath gain ten
pound

19:17 and he said unto him well thou good servant: becaus thou hast
been faith in a veri littl have thou author over ten citi

19:18 and the second came say lord thi pound hath gain five
pound

19:19 and he said likewis to him be thou also over five citi

19:20 and anoth came say lord behold here is thi pound which
i have kept laid up in a napkin: 19:21 for i fear thee becaus thou
art an auster man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down and
reapest that thou didst not sow

19:22 and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judg thee
thou wick servant thou knewest that i wa an auster man take up
that i laid not down and reap that i did not sow: 19:23 wherefor
then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my come i might
have requir mine own with usury? 19:24 and he said unto them that
stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten
pound

19:25 (and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds) 19:26 for i
say unto you that unto everi one which hath shall be given; and from
him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him

19:27 but those mine enemi which would not that i should reign over
them bring hither and slay them befor me

19:28 and when he had thu spoken he went befor ascend up to
jerusalem

19:29 and it came to pass when he wa come nigh to bethphag and
bethani at the mount call the mount of oliv he sent two of hi
discipl 19:30 say go ye into the villag over against you; in
the which at your enter ye shall find a colt tie whereon yet
never man sat: loos him and bring him hither

19:31 and if ani man ask you whi do ye loos him? thu shall ye say
unto him becaus the lord hath need of him

19:32 and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had
said unto them

19:33 and as they were loos the colt the owner thereof said unto
them whi loos ye the colt? 19:34 and they said the lord hath need
of him

19:35 and they brought him to jesus: and they cast their garment upon
the colt and they set jesu thereon

19:36 and as he went they spread their cloth in the way

19:37 and when he wa come nigh even now at the descent of the mount
of oliv the whole multitud of the discipl began to rejoic and
prais god with a loud voic for all the mighti work that they had
seen; 19:38 say bless be the king that cometh in the name of the
lord: peac in heaven and glori in the highest

19:39 and some of the pharise from among the multitud said unto
him master rebuk thi discipl

19:40 and he answer and said unto them i tell you that if these
should hold their peac the stone would immedi cri out

19:41 and when he wa come near he beheld the citi and wept over it
19:42 say if thou hadst known even thou at least in thi thi
day the thing which belong unto thi peace! but now they are hid from
thine eye

19:43 for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemi shall cast
a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on everi
side 19:44 and shall lay thee even with the ground and thi children
within thee; and they shall not leav in thee one stone upon another;
becaus thou knewest not the time of thi visit

19:45 and he went into the templ and began to cast out them that
sold therein and them that bought; 19:46 say unto them it is
written my hous is the hous of prayer: but ye have made it a den of
thiev

19:47 and he taught daili in the templ but the chief priest and the
scribe and the chief of the peopl sought to destroy him 19:48 and
could not find what they might do: for all the peopl were veri
attent to hear him

20:1 and it came to pass that on one of those day as he taught the
peopl in the templ and preach the gospel the chief priest and
the scribe came upon him with the elder 20:2 and spake unto him
say tell us by what author doest thou these things? or who is
he that gave thee thi authority? 20:3 and he answer and said unto
them i will also ask you one thing; and answer me: 20:4 the baptism
of john wa it from heaven or of men? 20:5 and they reason with
themselv say if we shall say from heaven; he will say whi
then believ ye him not? 20:6 but and if we say of men; all the
peopl will stone us: for they be persuad that john wa a prophet

20:7 and they answer that they could not tell whenc it wa

20:8 and jesu said unto them neither tell i you by what author i
do these thing

20:9 then began he to speak to the peopl thi parable; a certain man
plant a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a
far countri for a long time

20:10 and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat
him and sent him away empti

20:11 and again he sent anoth servant: and they beat him also and
entreat him shame and sent him away empti

20:12 and again he sent a third: and they wound him also and cast
him out

20:13 then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do? i will send
my belov son: it may be they will rever him when they see him

20:14 but when the husbandmen saw him they reason among themselv
say thi is the heir: come let us kill him that the inherit
may be our

20:15 so they cast him out of the vineyard and kill him what
therefor shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 20:16 he shall
come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to
other and when they heard it they said god forbid

20:17 and he beheld them and said what is thi then that is written
the stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of
the corner? 20:18 whosoev shall fall upon that stone shall be
broken; but on whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder

20:19 and the chief priest and the scribe the same hour sought to
lay hand on him; and they fear the people: for they perceiv that
he had spoken thi parabl against them

20:20 and they watch him and sent forth spi which should feign
themselv just men that they might take hold of hi word that so
they might deliv him unto the power and author of the governor

20:21 and they ask him say master we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightli neither acceptest thou the person of ani but
teachest the way of god truly: 20:22 is it law for us to give
tribut unto caesar or no? 20:23 but he perceiv their crafti
and said unto them whi tempt ye me? 20:24 shew me a penni whose
imag and superscript hath it? they answer and said caesar

20:25 and he said unto them render therefor unto caesar the thing
which be caesar and unto god the thing which be god

20:26 and they could not take hold of hi word befor the people: and
they marvel at hi answer and held their peac

20:27 then came to him certain of the sadduce which deni that there
is ani resurrection; and they ask him 20:28 say master mose
wrote unto us if ani man brother die have a wife and he die
without children that hi brother should take hi wife and rais up
seed unto hi brother

20:29 there were therefor seven brethren: and the first took a wife
and die without children

20:30 and the second took her to wife and he die childless

20:31 and the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
they left no children and die

20:32 last of all the woman die also

20:33 therefor in the resurrect whose wife of them is she? for
seven had her to wife

20:34 and jesu answer said unto them the children of thi world
marri and are given in marriage: 20:35 but they which shall be
account worthi to obtain that world and the resurrect from the
dead neither marri nor are given in marriage: 20:36 neither can they
die ani more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children
of god be the children of the resurrect

20:37 now that the dead are rais even mose shew at the bush
when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and
the god of jacob

20:38 for he is not a god of the dead but of the living: for all live
unto him

20:39 then certain of the scribe answer said master thou hast
well said

20:40 and after that they durst not ask him ani question at all

20:41 and he said unto them how say they that christ is david son?
20:42 and david himself saith in the book of psalm the lord said
unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 20:43 till i make thine
enemi thi footstool

20:44 david therefor calleth him lord how is he then hi son? 20:45
then in the audienc of all the peopl he said unto hi discipl
20:46 bewar of the scribe which desir to walk in long robe and
love greet in the market and the highest seat in the
synagogu and the chief room at feasts; 20:47 which devour widow
hous and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receiv
greater damnat

21:1 and he look up and saw the rich men cast their gift into
the treasuri

21:2 and he saw also a certain poor widow cast in thither two
mite

21:3 and he said of a truth i say unto you that thi poor widow hath
cast in more than they all: 21:4 for all these have of their abund
cast in unto the offer of god: but she of her penuri hath cast in
all the live that she had

21:5 and as some spake of the templ how it wa adorn with goodli
stone and gift he said 21:6 as for these thing which ye behold
the day will come in the which there shall not be left one stone
upon anoth that shall not be thrown down

21:7 and they ask him say master but when shall these thing
be? and what sign will there be when these thing shall come to pass?
21:8 and he said take heed that ye be not deceived: for mani shall
come in my name say i am christ; and the time draweth near: go ye
not therefor after them

21:9 but when ye shall hear of war and commot be not terrified:
for these thing must first come to pass; but the end is not by and
by

21:10 then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and
kingdom against kingdom: 21:11 and great earthquak shall be in
diver place and famin and pestilences; and fear sight and
great sign shall there be from heaven

21:12 but befor all these they shall lay their hand on you and
persecut you deliv you up to the synagogu and into prison
be brought befor king and ruler for my name sake

21:13 and it shall turn to you for a testimoni

21:14 settl it therefor in your heart not to medit befor what
ye shall answer: 21:15 for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which
all your adversari shall not be abl to gainsay nor resist

21:16 and ye shall be betray both by parent and brethren and
kinsfolk and friends; and some of you shall they caus to be put to
death

21:17 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name sake

21:18 but there shall not an hair of your head perish

21:19 in your patienc possess ye your soul

21:20 and when ye shall see jerusalem compass with armi then know
that the desol thereof is nigh

21:21 then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains; and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that
are in the countri enter thereinto

21:22 for these be the day of vengeanc that all thing which are
written may be fulfil

21:23 but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give
suck in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land
and wrath upon thi peopl

21:24 and they shall fall by the edg of the sword and shall be led
away captiv into all nations: and jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the gentil until the time of the gentil be fulfil

21:25 and there shall be sign in the sun and in the moon and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nation with perplexity; the
sea and the wave roaring; 21:26 men heart fail them for fear
and for look after those thing which are come on the earth: for
the power of heaven shall be shaken

21:27 and then shall they see the son of man come in a cloud with
power and great glori

21:28 and when these thing begin to come to pass then look up and
lift up your heads; for your redempt draweth nigh

21:29 and he spake to them a parable; behold the fig tree and all the
trees; 21:30 when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own
selv that summer is now nigh at hand

21:31 so likewis ye when ye see these thing come to pass know ye
that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand

21:32 verili i say unto you thi gener shall not pass away till
all be fulfil

21:33 heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass
away

21:34 and take heed to yourselv lest at ani time your heart be
overcharg with surfeit and drunken and care of thi life
and so that day come upon you unawar

21:35 for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth

21:36 watch ye therefor and pray alway that ye may be account
worthi to escap all these thing that shall come to pass and to
stand befor the son of man

21:37 and in the day time he wa teach in the temple; and at night
he went out and abod in the mount that is call the mount of
oliv

21:38 and all the peopl came earli in the morn to him in the
templ for to hear him

22:1 now the feast of unleaven bread drew nigh which is call the

furnished: there make readi

22:13 and they went and found as he had said unto them: and they made

among themselv which of them it wa that should do thi thing

22:24 and there wa also a strife among them which of them should be
account the greatest

22:25 and he said unto them the king of the gentil exercis

call benefactor

22:26 but ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you let
him be as the younger; and he that is chief as he that doth serv

22:27 for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that

22:28 ye are they which have continu with me in my temptat

22:29 and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appoint

done noth amiss

23:42 and he said unto jesu lord rememb me when thou comest into

23:43 and jesu said unto him verili i say unto thee to day shalt

23:44 and it wa about the sixth hour and there wa a dark over
all the earth until the ninth hour

23:45 and the sun wa darken and the veil of the templ wa rent in
the midst

23:46 and when jesu had cri with a loud voic he said father

the ghost

23:47 now when the centurion saw what wa done he glorifi god
say certainli thi wa a righteou man

23:48 and all the peopl that came togeth to that sight behold

23:52 thi man went unto pilat and beg the bodi of jesu

24:2 and they found the stone roll away from the sepulchr

24:3 and they enter in and found not the bodi of the lord jesu

24:4 and it came to pass as they were much perplex thereabout
behold two men stood by them in shine garments: 24:5 and as they
were afraid and bow down their face to the earth they said unto
them whi seek ye the live among the dead? 24:6 he is not here but

24:7 say the son of man must be deliv into the hand of sin

rest

24:10 it wa mari magdalen and joanna and mari the mother of jame
and other women that were with them which told these thing unto the

24:12 then aros peter and ran unto the sepulchre; and stoop down
he beheld the linen cloth laid by themselv and depart
wonder in himself at that which wa come to pass

24:13 and behold two of them went that same day to a villag call
emmau which wa from jerusalem about threescor furlong

24:14 and they talk togeth of all these thing which had happen

24:15 and it came to pass that while they commun togeth and
reason jesu himself drew near and went with them

24:16 but their eye were holden that they should not know him

24:17 and he said unto them what manner of commun are these
that ye have one to anoth as ye walk and are sad? 24:18 and the
one of them whose name wa cleopa answer said unto him art thou
onli a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the thing which are
come to pass there in these days? 24:19 and he said unto them what
things? and they said unto him concern jesu of nazareth which
wa a prophet mighti in deed and word befor god and all the people:
24:20 and how the chief priest and our ruler deliv him to be
condemn to death and have crucifi him

24:21 but we trust that it had been he which should have redeem
israel: and besid all thi to day is the third day sinc these
thing were done

24:22 yea and certain women also of our compani made us astonish
which were earli at the sepulchre; 24:23 and when they found not hi
bodi they came say that they had also seen a vision of angel
which said that he wa aliv

24:24 and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchr
and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not

24:25 then he said unto them o fool and slow of heart to believ
all that the prophet have spoken: 24:26 ought not christ to have
suffer these thing and to enter into hi glory? 24:27 and
begin at mose and all the prophet he expound unto them in all
the scriptur the thing concern himself

24:28 and they drew nigh unto the villag whither they went: and he
made as though he would have gone further

24:29 but they constrain him say abid with us: for it is
toward even and the day is far spent and he went in to tarri with
them

24:30 and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread
and bless it and brake and gave to them

24:31 and their eye were open and they knew him; and he vanish
out of their sight

24:32 and they said one to anoth did not our heart burn within us
while he talk with us by the way and while he open to us the
scriptures? 24:33 and they rose up the same hour and return to
jerusalem and found the eleven gather togeth and them that were
with them 24:34 say the lord is risen inde and hath appear
to simon

24:35 and they told what thing were done in the way and how he wa
known of them in break of bread

24:36 and as they thu spake jesu himself stood in the midst of
them and saith unto them peac be unto you

24:37 but they were terrifi and affright and suppos that they
had seen a spirit

24:38 and he said unto them whi are ye troubled? and whi do thought
aris in your hearts? 24:39 behold my hand and my feet that it is i
myself: handl me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bone as
ye see me have

24:40 and when he had thu spoken he shew them hi hand and hi
feet

24:41 and while they yet believ not for joy and wonder he said
unto them have ye here ani meat? 24:42 and they gave him a piec of
a broil fish and of an honeycomb

24:43 and he took it and did eat befor them

24:44 and he said unto them these are the word which i spake unto
you while i wa yet with you that all thing must be fulfil
which were written in the law of mose and in the prophet and in
the psalm concern me

24:45 then open he their understand that they might understand
the scriptur 24:46 and said unto them thu it is written and thu
it behov christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day:
24:47 and that repent and remiss of sin should be preach in
hi name among all nation begin at jerusalem

24:48 and ye are wit of these thing

24:49 and behold i send the promis of my father upon you: but tarri
ye in the citi of jerusalem until ye be endu with power from on
high

24:50 and he led them out as far as to bethani and he lift up hi
hand and bless them

24:51 and it came to pass while he bless them he wa part from
them and carri up into heaven

24:52 and they worship him and return to jerusalem with great
joy: 24:53 and were continu in the templ prais and bless
god amen



the gospel accord to saint john


1:1 in the begin wa the word and the word wa with god and the
word wa god

1:2 the same wa in the begin with god

1:3 all thing were made by him; and without him wa not ani thing
made that wa made

1:4 in him wa life; and the life wa the light of men

1:5 and the light shineth in darkness; and the dark comprehend
it not

1:6 there wa a man sent from god whose name wa john

1:7 the same came for a wit to bear wit of the light that
all men through him might believ

1:8 he wa not that light but wa sent to bear wit of that light

1:9 that wa the true light which lighteth everi man that cometh into
the world

1:10 he wa in the world and the world wa made by him and the world
knew him not

1:11 he came unto hi own and hi own receiv him not

1:12 but as mani as receiv him to them gave he power to becom the
son of god even to them that believ on hi name: 1:13 which were
born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of
man but of god

1:14 and the word wa made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld
hi glori the glori as of the onli begotten of the father) full of
grace and truth

1:15 john bare wit of him and cri say thi wa he of whom
i spake he that cometh after me is prefer befor me: for he wa
befor me

1:16 and of hi ful have all we receiv and grace for grace

1:17 for the law wa given by mose but grace and truth came by jesu
christ

1:18 no man hath seen god at ani time the onli begotten son which is
in the bosom of the father he hath declar him

1:19 and thi is the record of john when the jew sent priest and
levit from jerusalem to ask him who art thou? 1:20 and he
confess and deni not; but confess i am not the christ

1:21 and they ask him what then? art thou elias? and he saith i am
not art thou that prophet? and he answer no

1:22 then said they unto him who art thou? that we may give an answer
to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself? 1:23 he said i am
the voic of one cri in the wilder make straight the way of
the lord as said the prophet esaia

1:24 and they which were sent were of the pharise

1:25 and they ask him and said unto him whi baptizest thou then
if thou be not that christ nor elia neither that prophet? 1:26
john answer them say i baptiz with water: but there standeth
one among you whom ye know not; 1:27 he it is who come after me is
prefer befor me whose shoe latchet i am not worthi to unloos

1:28 these thing were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john wa
baptiz

1:29 the next day john seeth jesu come unto him and saith behold
the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world

1:30 thi is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is
prefer befor me: for he wa befor me

1:31 and i knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
israel therefor am i come baptiz with water

1:32 and john bare record say i saw the spirit descend from
heaven like a dove and it abod upon him

1:33 and i knew him not: but he that sent me to baptiz with water
the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend
and remain on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holi
ghost

1:34 and i saw and bare record that thi is the son of god

1:35 again the next day after john stood and two of hi disciples;
1:36 and look upon jesu as he walk he saith behold the lamb of
god! 1:37 and the two discipl heard him speak and they follow
jesu

1:38 then jesu turn and saw them follow and saith unto them
what seek ye? they said unto him rabbi (which is to say be
interpret master) where dwellest thou? 1:39 he saith unto them
come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abod with him
that day: for it wa about the tenth hour

1:40 one of the two which heard john speak and follow him wa
andrew simon peter brother

1:41 he first findeth hi own brother simon and saith unto him we
have found the messia which is be interpret the christ

1:42 and he brought him to jesu and when jesu beheld him he said
thou art simon the son of jona: thou shalt be call cepha which is
by interpret a stone

1:43 the day follow jesu would go forth into galile and findeth
philip and saith unto him follow me

1:44 now philip wa of bethsaida the citi of andrew and peter

1:45 philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him
of whom mose in the law and the prophet did write jesu of
nazareth the son of joseph

1:46 and nathanael said unto him can there ani good thing come out of
nazareth? philip saith unto him come and see

1:47 jesu saw nathanael come to him and saith of him behold an
israelit inde in whom is no guile! 1:48 nathanael saith unto him
whenc knowest thou me? jesu answer and said unto him befor that
philip call thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee

1:49 nathanael answer and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of
god; thou art the king of israel

1:50 jesu answer and said unto him becaus i said unto thee i saw
thee under the fig tree believest thou? thou shalt see greater thing
than these

1:51 and he saith unto him verili verili i say unto you hereaft
ye shall see heaven open and the angel of god ascend and
descend upon the son of man

2:1 and the third day there wa a marriag in cana of galilee; and the
mother of jesu wa there: 2:2 and both jesu wa call and hi
discipl to the marriag

2:3 and when they want wine the mother of jesu saith unto him
they have no wine

2:4 jesu saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come

2:5 hi mother saith unto the servant whatsoev he saith unto you
do it

2:6 and there were set there six waterpot of stone after the manner
of the purifi of the jew contain two or three firkin apiec

2:7 jesu saith unto them fill the waterpot with water and they
fill them up to the brim

2:8 and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast and they bare it

2:9 when the ruler of the feast had tast the water that wa made
wine and knew not whenc it was: (but the servant which drew the
water knew;) the governor of the feast call the bridegroom 2:10 and
saith unto him everi man at the begin doth set forth good wine;
and when men have well drunk then that which is worse: but thou hast
kept the good wine until now

2:11 thi begin of miracl did jesu in cana of galile and
manifest forth hi glory; and hi discipl believ on him

2:12 after thi he went down to capernaum he and hi mother and hi
brethren and hi disciples: and they continu there not mani day

2:13 and the jew passov wa at hand and jesu went up to
jerusalem

2:14 and found in the templ those that sold oxen and sheep and dove
and the changer of money sitting: 2:15 and when he had made a scourg
of small cord he drove them all out of the templ and the sheep
and the oxen; and pour out the changer money and overthrew the
tables; 2:16 and said unto them that sold dove take these thing
hence; make not my father hous an hous of merchandis

2:17 and hi discipl rememb that it wa written the zeal of
thine hous hath eaten me up

2:18 then answer the jew and said unto him what sign shewest thou
unto us see that thou doest these things? 2:19 jesu answer and
said unto them destroy thi templ and in three day i will rais it
up

2:20 then said the jew forti and six year wa thi templ in
build and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 2:21 but he spake
of the templ of hi bodi

2:22 when therefor he wa risen from the dead hi discipl
rememb that he had said thi unto them; and they believ the
scriptur and the word which jesu had said

2:23 now when he wa in jerusalem at the passov in the feast day
mani believ in hi name when they saw the miracl which he did

2:24 but jesu did not commit himself unto them becaus he knew all
men 2:25 and need not that ani should testifi of man: for he knew
what wa in man

3:1 there wa a man of the pharise name nicodemu a ruler of the
jews: 3:2 the same came to jesu by night and said unto him rabbi
we know that thou art a teacher come from god: for no man can do these
miracl that thou doest except god be with him

3:3 jesu answer and said unto him verili verili i say unto thee
except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god

3:4 nicodemu saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into hi mother womb and be born? 3:5
jesu answer verili verili i say unto thee except a man be born
of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god

3:6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
of the spirit is spirit

3:7 marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again

3:8 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound
thereof but canst not tell whenc it cometh and whither it goeth: so
is everi one that is born of the spirit

3:9 nicodemu answer and said unto him how can these thing be?
3:10 jesu answer and said unto him art thou a master of israel
and knowest not these things? 3:11 verili verili i say unto thee
we speak that we do know and testifi that we have seen; and ye
receiv not our wit

3:12 if i have told you earthli thing and ye believ not how shall
ye believ if i tell you of heavenli things? 3:13 and no man hath
ascend up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son
of man which is in heaven

3:14 and as mose lift up the serpent in the wilder even so
must the son of man be lift up: 3:15 that whosoev believeth in him
should not perish but have etern life

3:16 for god so love the world that he gave hi onli begotten son
that whosoev believeth in him should not perish but have
everlast life

3:17 for god sent not hi son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be save

3:18 he that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemn alreadi becaus he hath not believ in the name of
the onli begotten son of god

3:19 and thi is the condemn that light is come into the world
and men love dark rather than light becaus their deed were
evil

3:20 for everi one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to
the light lest hi deed should be reprov

3:21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that hi deed may
be made manifest that they are wrought in god

3:22 after these thing came jesu and hi discipl into the land of
judaea; and there he tarri with them and baptiz

3:23 and john also wa baptiz in aenon near to salim becaus there
wa much water there: and they came and were baptiz

3:24 for john wa not yet cast into prison

3:25 then there aros a question between some of john discipl and
the jew about purifi

3:26 and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that wa
with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest wit behold the same
baptizeth and all men come to him

3:27 john answer and said a man can receiv noth except it be
given him from heaven

3:28 ye yourselv bear me wit that i said i am not the christ
but that i am sent befor him

3:29 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatli becaus
of the bridegroom voice: thi my joy therefor is fulfil

3:30 he must increas but i must decreas

3:31 he that cometh from abov is abov all: he that is of the earth
is earthli and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is
abov all

3:32 and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth; and no man
receiveth hi testimoni

3:33 he that hath receiv hi testimoni hath set to hi seal that god
is true

3:34 for he whom god hath sent speaketh the word of god: for god
giveth not the spirit by measur unto him

3:35 the father loveth the son and hath given all thing into hi
hand

3:36 he that believeth on the son hath everlast life: and he that
believeth not the son shall not see life; but the wrath of god abideth
on him

4:1 when therefor the lord knew how the pharise had heard that
jesu made and baptiz more discipl than john 4:2 (though jesu
himself baptiz not but hi disciples) 4:3 he left judaea and
depart again into galile

4:4 and he must need go through samaria

4:5 then cometh he to a citi of samaria which is call sychar near
to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to hi son joseph

4:6 now jacob well wa there jesu therefor be weari with
hi journey sat thu on the well: and it wa about the sixth hour

4:7 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water: jesu saith unto
her give me to drink

4:8 (for hi discipl were gone away unto the citi to buy meat) 4:9
then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou be a
jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria? for the jew
have no deal with the samaritan

4:10 jesu answer and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of
god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink; thou wouldest
have ask of him and he would have given thee live water

4:11 the woman saith unto him sir thou hast noth to draw with
and the well is deep: from whenc then hast thou that live water?
4:12 art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well
and drank thereof himself and hi children and hi cattle? 4:13
jesu answer and said unto her whosoev drinketh of thi water
shall thirst again: 4:14 but whosoev drinketh of the water that i
shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that i shall give him
shall be in him a well of water spring up into everlast life

4:15 the woman saith unto him sir give me thi water that i thirst
not neither come hither to draw

4:16 jesu saith unto her go call thi husband and come hither

4:17 the woman answer and said i have no husband jesu said unto
her thou hast well said i have no husband: 4:18 for thou hast had
five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thi husband: in that
saidst thou truli

4:19 the woman saith unto him sir i perceiv that thou art a
prophet

4:20 our father worship in thi mountain; and ye say that in
jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship

4:21 jesu saith unto her woman believ me the hour cometh when ye
shall neither in thi mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the
father

4:22 ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvat is of the jew

4:23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipp shall
worship the father in spirit and in truth: for the father seeketh such
to worship him

4:24 god is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth

4:25 the woman saith unto him i know that messia cometh which is
call christ: when he is come he will tell us all thing

4:26 jesu saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he

4:27 and upon thi came hi discipl and marvel that he talk
with the woman: yet no man said what seekest thou? or whi talkest
thou with her? 4:28 the woman then left her waterpot and went her
way into the citi and saith to the men 4:29 come see a man which
told me all thing that ever i did: is not thi the christ? 4:30 then
they went out of the citi and came unto him

4:31 in the mean while hi discipl pray him say master eat

4:32 but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of

4:33 therefor said the discipl one to anoth hath ani man brought
him ought to eat? 4:34 jesu saith unto them my meat is to do the
will of him that sent me and to finish hi work

4:35 say not ye there are yet four month and then cometh harvest?
behold i say unto you lift up your eye and look on the fields; for
they are white alreadi to harvest

4:36 and he that reapeth receiveth wage and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoic
togeth

4:37 and herein is that say true one soweth and anoth reapeth

4:38 i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestow no labour: other men
labour and ye are enter into their labour

4:39 and mani of the samaritan of that citi believ on him for the
say of the woman which testifi he told me all that ever i did

4:40 so when the samaritan were come unto him they besought him that
he would tarri with them: and he abod there two day

4:41 and mani more believ becaus of hi own word; 4:42 and said
unto the woman now we believ not becaus of thi saying: for we have
heard him ourselv and know that thi is inde the christ the
saviour of the world

4:43 now after two day he depart thenc and went into galile

4:44 for jesu himself testifi that a prophet hath no honour in hi
own countri

4:45 then when he wa come into galile the galilaean receiv him
have seen all the thing that he did at jerusalem at the feast: for
they also went unto the feast

4:46 so jesu came again into cana of galile where he made the water
wine and there wa a certain nobleman whose son wa sick at
capernaum

4:47 when he heard that jesu wa come out of judaea into galile he
went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal hi
son: for he wa at the point of death

4:48 then said jesu unto him except ye see sign and wonder ye
will not believ

4:49 the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die

4:50 jesu saith unto him go thi way; thi son liveth and the man
believ the word that jesu had spoken unto him and he went hi way

4:51 and as he wa now go down hi servant met him and told him
say thi son liveth

4:52 then enquir he of them the hour when he began to amend and
they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him

4:53 so the father knew that it wa at the same hour in the which
jesu said unto him thi son liveth: and himself believ and hi
whole hous

4:54 thi is again the second miracl that jesu did when he wa come
out of judaea into galile

5:1 after thi there wa a feast of the jews; and jesu went up to
jerusalem

5:2 now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is
call in the hebrew tongu bethesda have five porch

5:3 in these lay a great multitud of impot folk of blind halt
wither wait for the move of the water

5:4 for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and
troubl the water: whosoev then first after the troubl of the
water step in wa made whole of whatsoev diseas he had

5:5 and a certain man wa there which had an infirm thirti and
eight year

5:6 when jesu saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole? 5:7 the
impot man answer him sir i have no man when the water is
troubl to put me into the pool: but while i am come anoth
steppeth down befor me

5:8 jesu saith unto him rise take up thi bed and walk

5:9 and immedi the man wa made whole and took up hi bed and
walked: and on the same day wa the sabbath

5:10 the jew therefor said unto him that wa cure it is the
sabbath day: it is not law for thee to carri thi bed

5:11 he answer them he that made me whole the same said unto me
take up thi bed and walk

5:12 then ask they him what man is that which said unto thee take
up thi bed and walk? 5:13 and he that wa heal wist not who it
was: for jesu had convey himself away a multitud be in that
place

5:14 afterward jesu findeth him in the templ and said unto him
behold thou art made whole: sin no more lest a wors thing come unto
thee

5:15 the man depart and told the jew that it wa jesu which had
made him whole

5:16 and therefor did the jew persecut jesu and sought to slay
him becaus he had done these thing on the sabbath day

5:17 but jesu answer them my father worketh hitherto and i work

5:18 therefor the jew sought the more to kill him becaus he not
onli had broken the sabbath but said also that god wa hi father
make himself equal with god

5:19 then answer jesu and said unto them verili verili i say
unto you the son can do noth of himself but what he seeth the
father do: for what thing soever he doeth these also doeth the son
likewis

5:20 for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all thing that
himself doeth: and he will shew him greater work than these that ye
may marvel

5:21 for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them; even
so the son quickeneth whom he will

5:22 for the father judgeth no man but hath commit all judgment
unto the son: 5:23 that all men should honour the son even as they
honour the father

he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent
him

5:24 verili verili i say unto you he that heareth my word and
believeth on him that sent me hath everlast life and shall not
come into condemnation; but is pass from death unto life

5:25 verili verili i say unto you the hour is come and now is
when the dead shall hear the voic of the son of god: and they that
hear shall live

5:26 for as the father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
son to have life in himself; 5:27 and hath given him author to
execut judgment also becaus he is the son of man

5:28 marvel not at this: for the hour is come in the which all that
are in the grave shall hear hi voic 5:29 and shall come forth;
they that have done good unto the resurrect of life; and they that
have done evil unto the resurrect of damnat

5:30 i can of mine own self do nothing: as i hear i judge: and my
judgment is just; becaus i seek not mine own will but the will of
the father which hath sent me

5:31 if i bear wit of myself my wit is not true

5:32 there is anoth that beareth wit of me; and i know that the
wit which he witnesseth of me is true

5:33 ye sent unto john and he bare wit unto the truth

5:34 but i receiv not testimoni from man: but these thing i say
that ye might be save

5:35 he wa a burn and a shine light: and ye were will for a
season to rejoic in hi light

5:36 but i have greater wit than that of john: for the work which
the father hath given me to finish the same work that i do bear
wit of me that the father hath sent me

5:37 and the father himself which hath sent me hath born wit of
me

ye have neither heard hi voic at ani time nor seen hi shape

5:38 and ye have not hi word abid in you: for whom he hath sent
him ye believ not

5:39 search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have etern life:
and they are they which testifi of me

5:40 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life

5:41 i receiv not honour from men

5:42 but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you

5:43 i am come in my father name and ye receiv me not: if anoth
shall come in hi own name him ye will receiv

5:44 how can ye believ which receiv honour one of anoth and seek
not the honour that cometh from god only? 5:45 do not think that i
will accus you to the father: there is one that accuseth you even
mose in whom ye trust

5:46 for had ye believ mose ye would have believ me; for he
wrote of me

5:47 but if ye believ not hi write how shall ye believ my
words? 6:1 after these thing jesu went over the sea of galile
which is the sea of tiberia

6:2 and a great multitud follow him becaus they saw hi miracl
which he did on them that were diseas

6:3 and jesu went up into a mountain and there he sat with hi
discipl

6:4 and the passov a feast of the jew wa nigh

6:5 when jesu then lift up hi eye and saw a great compani come
unto him he saith unto philip whenc shall we buy bread that these
may eat? 6:6 and thi he said to prove him: for he himself knew what
he would do

6:7 philip answer him two hundr pennyworth of bread is not
suffici for them that everi one of them may take a littl

6:8 one of hi discipl andrew simon peter brother saith unto
him 6:9 there is a lad here which hath five barley loav and two
small fishes: but what are they among so many? 6:10 and jesu said
make the men sit down now there wa much grass in the place so the
men sat down in number about five thousand

6:11 and jesu took the loaves; and when he had given thank he
distribut to the discipl and the discipl to them that were set
down; and likewis of the fish as much as they would

6:12 when they were fill he said unto hi discipl gather up the
fragment that remain that noth be lost

6:13 therefor they gather them togeth and fill twelv basket
with the fragment of the five barley loav which remain over and
abov unto them that had eaten

6:14 then those men when they had seen the miracl that jesu did
said thi is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world

6:15 when jesu therefor perceiv that they would come and take him
by forc to make him a king he depart again into a mountain
himself alon

6:16 and when even wa now come hi discipl went down unto the sea
6:17 and enter into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum
and it wa now dark and jesu wa not come to them

6:18 and the sea aros by reason of a great wind that blew

6:19 so when they had row about five and twenti or thirti furlong
they see jesu walk on the sea and draw nigh unto the ship: and
they were afraid

6:20 but he saith unto them it is i; be not afraid

6:21 then they willingli receiv him into the ship: and immedi
the ship wa at the land whither they went

6:22 the day follow when the peopl which stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there wa none other boat there save that one
whereinto hi discipl were enter and that jesu went not with hi
discipl into the boat but that hi discipl were gone away alone;
6:23 (howbeit there came other boat from tiberia nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks:) 6:24
when the peopl therefor saw that jesu wa not there neither hi
discipl they also took ship and came to capernaum seek for
jesu

6:25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they
said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither? 6:26 jesu answer
them and said verili verili i say unto you ye seek me not becaus
ye saw the miracl but becaus ye did eat of the loav and were
fill

6:27 labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which
endureth unto everlast life which the son of man shall give unto
you: for him hath god the father seal

6:28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the
work of god? 6:29 jesu answer and said unto them thi is the
work of god that ye believ on him whom he hath sent

6:30 they said therefor unto him what sign shewest thou then that
we may see and believ thee? what dost thou work? 6:31 our father
did eat manna in the desert; as it is written he gave them bread from
heaven to eat

6:32 then jesu said unto them verili verili i say unto you mose
gave you not that bread from heaven; but my father giveth you the true
bread from heaven

6:33 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life unto the world

6:34 then said they unto him lord evermor give us thi bread

6:35 and jesu said unto them i am the bread of life: he that cometh
to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst

6:36 but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believ not

6:37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me i will in no wise cast out

6:38 for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the
will of him that sent me

6:39 and thi is the father will which hath sent me that of all
which he hath given me i should lose noth but should rais it up
again at the last day

6:40 and thi is the will of him that sent me that everi one which
seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlast life: and i
will rais him up at the last day

6:41 the jew then murmur at him becaus he said i am the bread
which came down from heaven

6:42 and they said is not thi jesu the son of joseph whose father
and mother we know? how is it then that he saith i came down from
heaven? 6:43 jesu therefor answer and said unto them murmur not
among yourselv

6:44 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw
him: and i will rais him up at the last day

6:45 it is written in the prophet and they shall be all taught of
god

everi man therefor that hath heard and hath learn of the father
cometh unto me

6:46 not that ani man hath seen the father save he which is of god
he hath seen the father

6:47 verili verili i say unto you he that believeth on me hath
everlast life

6:48 i am that bread of life

6:49 your father did eat manna in the wilder and are dead

6:50 thi is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may
eat thereof and not die

6:51 i am the live bread which came down from heaven: if ani man eat
of thi bread he shall live for ever: and the bread that i will give
is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world

6:52 the jew therefor strove among themselv say how can thi
man give us hi flesh to eat? 6:53 then jesu said unto them verili
verili i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and
drink hi blood ye have no life in you

6:54 whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath etern life;
and i will rais him up at the last day

6:55 for my flesh is meat inde and my blood is drink inde

6:56 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me
and i in him

6:57 as the live father hath sent me and i live by the father: so
he that eateth me even he shall live by me

6:58 thi is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
father did eat manna and are dead: he that eateth of thi bread
shall live for ever

6:59 these thing said he in the synagogu as he taught in capernaum

6:60 mani therefor of hi discipl when they had heard thi said
thi is an hard saying; who can hear it? 6:61 when jesu knew in
himself that hi discipl murmur at it he said unto them doth
thi offend you? 6:62 what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend
up where he wa before? 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth; the
flesh profiteth nothing: the word that i speak unto you they are
spirit and they are life

6:64 but there are some of you that believ not for jesu knew from
the begin who they were that believ not and who should betray
him

6:65 and he said therefor said i unto you that no man can come unto
me except it were given unto him of my father

6:66 from that time mani of hi discipl went back and walk no
more with him

6:67 then said jesu unto the twelv will ye also go away? 6:68 then
simon peter answer him lord to whom shall we go? thou hast the
word of etern life

6:69 and we believ and are sure that thou art that christ the son of
the live god

6:70 jesu answer them have not i chosen you twelv and one of you
is a devil? 6:71 he spake of juda iscariot the son of simon: for he
it wa that should betray him be one of the twelv

7:1 after these thing jesu walk in galilee: for he would not walk
in jewri becaus the jew sought to kill him

7:2 now the jew feast of tabernacl wa at hand

7:3 hi brethren therefor said unto him depart henc and go into
judaea that thi discipl also may see the work that thou doest

7:4 for there is no man that doeth ani thing in secret and he himself
seeketh to be known openli if thou do these thing shew thyself to
the world

7:5 for neither did hi brethren believ in him

7:6 then jesu said unto them my time is not yet come: but your time
is alway readi

7:7 the world cannot hate you; but me it hateth becaus i testifi of
it that the work thereof are evil

7:8 go ye up unto thi feast: i go not up yet unto thi feast: for my
time is not yet full come

7:9 when he had said these word unto them he abod still in galile

7:10 but when hi brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the
feast not openli but as it were in secret

7:11 then the jew sought him at the feast and said where is he?
7:12 and there wa much murmur among the peopl concern him: for
some said he is a good man: other said nay; but he deceiveth the
peopl

7:13 howbeit no man spake openli of him for fear of the jew

7:14 now about the midst of the feast jesu went up into the templ
and taught

7:15 and the jew marvel say how knoweth thi man letter
have never learned? 7:16 jesu answer them and said my doctrin
is not mine but hi that sent me

7:17 if ani man will do hi will he shall know of the doctrin
whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself

7:18 he that speaketh of himself seeketh hi own glory: but he that
seeketh hi glori that sent him the same is true and no
unright is in him

7:19 did not mose give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the
law? whi go ye about to kill me? 7:20 the peopl answer and said
thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 7:21 jesu answer
and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel

7:22 mose therefor gave unto you circumcision; (not becaus it is of
mose but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcis a
man

7:23 if a man on the sabbath day receiv circumcis that the law of
mose should not be broken; are ye angri at me becaus i have made a
man everi whit whole on the sabbath day? 7:24 judg not accord to
the appear but judg righteou judgment

7:25 then said some of them of jerusalem is not thi he whom they
seek to kill? 7:26 but lo he speaketh boldli and they say noth
unto him do the ruler know inde that thi is the veri christ?
7:27 howbeit we know thi man whenc he is: but when christ cometh no
man knoweth whenc he is

7:28 then cri jesu in the templ as he taught say ye both know
me and ye know whenc i am: and i am not come of myself but he that
sent me is true whom ye know not

7:29 but i know him: for i am from him and he hath sent me

7:30 then they sought to take him: but no man laid hand on him
becaus hi hour wa not yet come

7:31 and mani of the peopl believ on him and said when christ
cometh will he do more miracl than these which thi man hath done?
7:32 the pharise heard that the peopl murmur such thing
concern him; and the pharise and the chief priest sent offic
to take him

7:33 then said jesu unto them yet a littl while am i with you and
then i go unto him that sent me

7:34 ye shall seek me and shall not find me: and where i am thither
ye cannot come

7:35 then said the jew among themselv whither will he go that we
shall not find him? will he go unto the dispers among the gentil
and teach the gentiles? 7:36 what manner of say is thi that he
said ye shall seek me and shall not find me: and where i am thither
ye cannot come? 7:37 in the last day that great day of the feast
jesu stood and cri say if ani man thirst let him come unto
me and drink

7:38 he that believeth on me as the scriptur hath said out of hi
belli shall flow river of live water

7:39 (but thi spake he of the spirit which they that believ on him
should receive: for the holi ghost wa not yet given; becaus that
jesu wa not yet glorified) 7:40 mani of the peopl therefor when
they heard thi say said of a truth thi is the prophet

7:41 other said thi is the christ but some said shall christ come
out of galilee? 7:42 hath not the scriptur said that christ cometh
of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david
was? 7:43 so there wa a divis among the peopl becaus of him

7:44 and some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hand on
him

7:45 then came the offic to the chief priest and pharisees; and
they said unto them whi have ye not brought him? 7:46 the offic
answer never man spake like thi man

7:47 then answer them the pharise are ye also deceived? 7:48
have ani of the ruler or of the pharise believ on him? 7:49 but
thi peopl who knoweth not the law are curs

7:50 nicodemu saith unto them (he that came to jesu by night be
one of them) 7:51 doth our law judg ani man befor it hear him and
know what he doeth? 7:52 they answer and said unto him art thou
also of galilee? search and look: for out of galile ariseth no
prophet

7:53 and everi man went unto hi own hous

8:1 jesu went unto the mount of oliv

8:2 and earli in the morn he came again into the templ and all
the peopl came unto him; and he sat down and taught them

8:3 and the scribe and pharise brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery; and when they had set her in the midst 8:4 they say unto
him master thi woman wa taken in adulteri in the veri act

8:5 now mose in the law command us that such should be stoned: but
what sayest thou? 8:6 thi they said tempt him that they might
have to accus him but jesu stoop down and with hi finger wrote
on the ground as though he heard them not

8:7 so when they continu ask him he lift up himself and said
unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a
stone at her

8:8 and again he stoop down and wrote on the ground

8:9 and they which heard it be convict by their own conscienc
went out one by one begin at the eldest even unto the last: and
jesu wa left alon and the woman stand in the midst

8:10 when jesu had lift up himself and saw none but the woman he
said unto her woman where are those thine accusers? hath no man
condemn thee? 8:11 she said no man lord and jesu said unto her
neither do i condemn thee: go and sin no more

8:12 then spake jesu again unto them say i am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in dark but shall have
the light of life

8:13 the pharise therefor said unto him thou bearest record of
thyself; thi record is not true

8:14 jesu answer and said unto them though i bear record of
myself yet my record is true: for i know whenc i came and whither i
go; but ye cannot tell whenc i come and whither i go

8:15 ye judg after the flesh; i judg no man

8:16 and yet if i judg my judgment is true: for i am not alon but
i and the father that sent me

8:17 it is also written in your law that the testimoni of two men is
true

8:18 i am one that bear wit of myself and the father that sent me
beareth wit of me

8:19 then said they unto him where is thi father? jesu answer ye
neither know me nor my father: if ye had known me ye should have
known my father also

8:20 these word spake jesu in the treasuri as he taught in the
temple: and no man laid hand on him; for hi hour wa not yet come

8:21 then said jesu again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek
me and shall die in your sins: whither i go ye cannot come

8:22 then said the jew will he kill himself? becaus he saith
whither i go ye cannot come

8:23 and he said unto them ye are from beneath; i am from above: ye
are of thi world; i am not of thi world

8:24 i said therefor unto you that ye shall die in your sins: for if
ye believ not that i am he ye shall die in your sin

8:25 then said they unto him who art thou? and jesu saith unto them
even the same that i said unto you from the begin

8:26 i have mani thing to say and to judg of you: but he that sent
me is true; and i speak to the world those thing which i have heard
of him

8:27 they understood not that he spake to them of the father

8:28 then said jesu unto them when ye have lift up the son of man
then shall ye know that i am he and that i do noth of myself; but
as my father hath taught me i speak these thing

8:29 and he that sent me is with me: the father hath not left me
alone; for i do alway those thing that pleas him

8:30 as he spake these word mani believ on him

8:31 then said jesu to those jew which believ on him if ye
continu in my word then are ye my discipl indeed; 8:32 and ye
shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free

8:33 they answer him we be abraham seed and were never in
bondag to ani man: how sayest thou ye shall be made free? 8:34
jesu answer them verili verili i say unto you whosoev
committeth sin is the servant of sin

8:35 and the servant abideth not in the hous for ever: but the son
abideth ever

8:36 if the son therefor shall make you free ye shall be free
inde

8:37 i know that ye are abraham seed; but ye seek to kill me
becaus my word hath no place in you

8:38 i speak that which i have seen with my father: and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father

8:39 they answer and said unto him abraham is our father jesu
saith unto them if ye were abraham children ye would do the work
of abraham

8:40 but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth
which i have heard of god: thi did not abraham

8:41 ye do the deed of your father then said they to him we be not
born of fornication; we have one father even god

8:42 jesu said unto them if god were your father ye would love me:
for i proceed forth and came from god; neither came i of myself but
he sent me

8:43 whi do ye not understand my speech? even becaus ye cannot hear
my word

8:44 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye
will do he wa a murder from the begin and abod not in the
truth becaus there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
speaketh of hi own: for he is a liar and the father of it

8:45 and becaus i tell you the truth ye believ me not

8:46 which of you convinceth me of sin? and if i say the truth whi do
ye not believ me? 8:47 he that is of god heareth god words: ye
therefor hear them not becaus ye are not of god

8:48 then answer the jew and said unto him say we not well that
thou art a samaritan and hast a devil? 8:49 jesu answer i have
not a devil; but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me

8:50 and i seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
judgeth

8:51 verili verili i say unto you if a man keep my say he shall
never see death

8:52 then said the jew unto him now we know that thou hast a devil

abraham is dead and the prophets; and thou sayest if a man keep my
say he shall never tast of death

8:53 art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead? and the
prophet are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 8:54 jesu answer if
i honour myself my honour is nothing: it is my father that honoureth
me; of whom ye say that he is your god: 8:55 yet ye have not known
him; but i know him: and if i should say i know him not i shall be a
liar like unto you: but i know him and keep hi say

8:56 your father abraham rejoic to see my day: and he saw it and
wa glad

8:57 then said the jew unto him thou art not yet fifti year old
and hast thou seen abraham? 8:58 jesu said unto them verili
verili i say unto you befor abraham wa i am

8:59 then took they up stone to cast at him: but jesu hid himself
and went out of the templ go through the midst of them and so
pass by

9:1 and as jesu pass by he saw a man which wa blind from hi
birth

9:2 and hi discipl ask him say master who did sin thi
man or hi parent that he wa born blind? 9:3 jesu answer
neither hath thi man sin nor hi parents: but that the work of
god should be made manifest in him

9:4 i must work the work of him that sent me while it is day: the
night cometh when no man can work

9:5 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world

9:6 when he had thu spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of
the spittl and he anoint the eye of the blind man with the clay
9:7 and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam (which is by
interpret sent) he went hi way therefor and wash and came
see

9:8 the neighbour therefor and they which befor had seen him that
he wa blind said is not thi he that sat and begged? 9:9 some
said thi is he: other said he is like him: but he said i am he

9:10 therefor said they unto him how were thine eye opened? 9:11
he answer and said a man that is call jesu made clay and
anoint mine eye and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and
wash: and i went and wash and i receiv sight

9:12 then said they unto him where is he? he said i know not

9:13 they brought to the pharise him that aforetim wa blind

9:14 and it wa the sabbath day when jesu made the clay and open
hi eye

9:15 then again the pharise also ask him how he had receiv hi
sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eye and i wash
and do see

9:16 therefor said some of the pharise thi man is not of god
becaus he keepeth not the sabbath day other said how can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles? and there wa a divis among
them

9:17 they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that
he hath open thine eyes? he said he is a prophet

9:18 but the jew did not believ concern him that he had been
blind and receiv hi sight until they call the parent of him
that had receiv hi sight

9:19 and they ask them say is thi your son who ye say wa
born blind? how then doth he now see? 9:20 hi parent answer them
and said we know that thi is our son and that he wa born blind:
9:21 but by what mean he now seeth we know not; or who hath open
hi eye we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for
himself

9:22 these word spake hi parent becaus they fear the jews: for
the jew had agre alreadi that if ani man did confess that he wa
christ he should be put out of the synagogu

9:23 therefor said hi parent he is of age; ask him

9:24 then again call they the man that wa blind and said unto him
give god the praise: we know that thi man is a sinner

9:25 he answer and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not:
one thing i know that wherea i wa blind now i see

9:26 then said they to him again what did he to thee? how open he
thine eyes? 9:27 he answer them i have told you alreadi and ye
did not hear: wherefor would ye hear it again? will ye also be hi
disciples? 9:28 then they revil him and said thou art hi
disciple; but we are mose discipl

9:29 we know that god spake unto moses: as for thi fellow we know
not from whenc he is

9:30 the man answer and said unto them whi herein is a marvel
thing that ye know not from whenc he is and yet he hath open mine
eye

9:31 now we know that god heareth not sinners: but if ani man be a
worshipp of god and doeth hi will him he heareth

9:32 sinc the world began wa it not heard that ani man open the
eye of one that wa born blind

9:33 if thi man were not of god he could do noth

9:34 they answer and said unto him thou wast altogeth born in
sin and dost thou teach us? and they cast him out

9:35 jesu heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
him he said unto him dost thou believ on the son of god? 9:36 he
answer and said who is he lord that i might believ on him? 9:37
and jesu said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that
talketh with thee

9:38 and he said lord i believ and he worship him

9:39 and jesu said for judgment i am come into thi world that they
which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind

9:40 and some of the pharise which were with him heard these word
and said unto him are we blind also? 9:41 jesu said unto them if
ye were blind ye should have no sin: but now ye say we see;
therefor your sin remaineth

10:1 verili verili i say unto you he that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a
thief and a robber

10:2 but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep

10:3 to him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear hi voice: and he
calleth hi own sheep by name and leadeth them out

10:4 and when he putteth forth hi own sheep he goeth befor them
and the sheep follow him: for they know hi voic

10:5 and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him: for
they know not the voic of stranger

10:6 thi parabl spake jesu unto them: but they understood not what
thing they were which he spake unto them

10:7 then said jesu unto them again verili verili i say unto you
i am the door of the sheep

10:8 all that ever came befor me are thiev and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them

10:9 i am the door: by me if ani man enter in he shall be save and
shall go in and out and find pastur

10:10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to
destroy: i am come that they might have life and that they might have
it more abundantli

10:11 i am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth hi life for
the sheep

10:12 but he that is an hirel and not the shepherd whose own the
sheep are not seeth the wolf come and leaveth the sheep and
fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep

10:13 the hirel fleeth becaus he is an hirel and careth not
for the sheep

10:14 i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine

10:15 as the father knoweth me even so know i the father: and i lay
down my life for the sheep

10:16 and other sheep i have which are not of thi fold: them also i
must bring and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold
and one shepherd

10:17 therefor doth my father love me becaus i lay down my life
that i might take it again

10:18 no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have
power to lay it down and i have power to take it again thi
command have i receiv of my father

10:19 there wa a divis therefor again among the jew for these
say

10:20 and mani of them said he hath a devil and is mad; whi hear ye
him? 10:21 other said these are not the word of him that hath a
devil can a devil open the eye of the blind? 10:22 and it wa at
jerusalem the feast of the dedic and it wa winter

10:23 and jesu walk in the templ in solomon porch

10:24 then came the jew round about him and said unto him how long
dost thou make us to doubt? if thou be the christ tell us plainli

10:25 jesu answer them i told you and ye believ not: the work
that i do in my father name they bear wit of me

10:26 but ye believ not becaus ye are not of my sheep as i said
unto you

10:27 my sheep hear my voic and i know them and they follow me:
10:28 and i give unto them etern life; and they shall never perish
neither shall ani man pluck them out of my hand

10:29 my father which gave them me is greater than all; and no man
is abl to pluck them out of my father hand

10:30 i and my father are one

10:31 then the jew took up stone again to stone him

10:32 jesu answer them mani good work have i shew you from my
father; for which of those work do ye stone me? 10:33 the jew
answer him say for a good work we stone thee not; but for
blasphemy; and becaus that thou be a man makest thyself god

10:34 jesu answer them is it not written in your law i said ye
are gods? 10:35 if he call them god unto whom the word of god
came and the scriptur cannot be broken; 10:36 say ye of him whom
the father hath sanctifi and sent into the world thou blasphemest;
becaus i said i am the son of god? 10:37 if i do not the work of
my father believ me not

10:38 but if i do though ye believ not me believ the works: that
ye may know and believ that the father is in me and i in him

10:39 therefor they sought again to take him: but he escap out of
their hand 10:40 and went away again beyond jordan into the place
where john at first baptized; and there he abod

10:41 and mani resort unto him and said john did no miracle: but
all thing that john spake of thi man were true

10:42 and mani believ on him there

11:1 now a certain man wa sick name lazaru of bethani the town
of mari and her sister martha

11:2 (it wa that mari which anoint the lord with ointment and
wipe hi feet with her hair whose brother lazaru wa sick) 11:3
therefor hi sister sent unto him say lord behold he whom
thou lovest is sick

11:4 when jesu heard that he said thi sick is not unto death
but for the glori of god that the son of god might be glorifi
therebi

11:5 now jesu love martha and her sister and lazaru

11:6 when he had heard therefor that he wa sick he abod two day
still in the same place where he wa

11:7 then after that saith he to hi discipl let us go into judaea
again

11:8 hi discipl say unto him master the jew of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 11:9 jesu answer are
there not twelv hour in the day? if ani man walk in the day he
stumbleth not becaus he seeth the light of thi world

11:10 but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth becaus there is
no light in him

11:11 these thing said he: and after that he saith unto them our
friend lazaru sleepeth; but i go that i may awak him out of sleep

11:12 then said hi discipl lord if he sleep he shall do well

11:13 howbeit jesu spake of hi death: but they thought that he had
spoken of take of rest in sleep

11:14 then said jesu unto them plainli lazaru is dead

11:15 and i am glad for your sake that i wa not there to the intent
ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him

11:16 then said thoma which is call didymu unto hi
fellowdiscipl let us also go that we may die with him

11:17 then when jesu came he found that he had lain in the grave
four day alreadi

11:18 now bethani wa nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlong off:
11:19 and mani of the jew came to martha and mari to comfort them
concern their brother

11:20 then martha as soon as she heard that jesu wa come went
and met him: but mari sat still in the hous

11:21 then said martha unto jesu lord if thou hadst been here my
brother had not die

11:22 but i know that even now whatsoev thou wilt ask of god god
will give it thee

11:23 jesu saith unto her thi brother shall rise again

11:24 martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the
resurrect at the last day

11:25 jesu said unto her i am the resurrect and the life: he
that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live: 11:26
and whosoev liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest
thou this? 11:27 she saith unto him yea lord: i believ that thou
art the christ the son of god which should come into the world

11:28 and when she had so said she went her way and call mari her
sister secretli say the master is come and calleth for thee

11:29 as soon as she heard that she aros quickli and came unto him

11:30 now jesu wa not yet come into the town but wa in that place
where martha met him

11:31 the jew then which were with her in the hous and comfort
her when they saw mari that she rose up hastili and went out
follow her say she goeth unto the grave to weep there

11:32 then when mari wa come where jesu wa and saw him she fell
down at hi feet say unto him lord if thou hadst been here my
brother had not die

11:33 when jesu therefor saw her weep and the jew also weep
which came with her he groan in the spirit and wa troubl

11:34 and said where have ye laid him? they said unto him lord come
and see

11:35 jesu wept

11:36 then said the jew behold how he love him! 11:37 and some of
them said could not thi man which open the eye of the blind
have caus that even thi man should not have died? 11:38 jesu
therefor again groan in himself cometh to the grave it wa a
cave and a stone lay upon it

11:39 jesu said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him
that wa dead saith unto him lord by thi time he stinketh: for he
hath been dead four day

11:40 jesu saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou
wouldest believ thou shouldest see the glori of god? 11:41 then
they took away the stone from the place where the dead wa laid and
jesu lift up hi eye and said father i thank thee that thou
hast heard me

11:42 and i knew that thou hearest me always: but becaus of the
peopl which stand by i said it that they may believ that thou hast
sent me

11:43 and when he thu had spoken he cri with a loud voic
lazaru come forth

11:44 and he that wa dead came forth bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and hi face wa bound about with a napkin jesu saith
unto them loos him and let him go

11:45 then mani of the jew which came to mari and had seen the
thing which jesu did believ on him

11:46 but some of them went their way to the pharise and told them
what thing jesu had done

11:47 then gather the chief priest and the pharise a council and
said what do we? for thi man doeth mani miracl

11:48 if we let him thu alon all men will believ on him: and the
roman shall come and take away both our place and nation

11:49 and one of them name caiapha be the high priest that same
year said unto them ye know noth at all 11:50 nor consid that
it is expedi for us that one man should die for the peopl and
that the whole nation perish not

11:51 and thi spake he not of himself: but be high priest that
year he prophesi that jesu should die for that nation; 11:52 and
not for that nation onli but that also he should gather togeth in
one the children of god that were scatter abroad

11:53 then from that day forth they took counsel togeth for to put
him to death

11:54 jesu therefor walk no more openli among the jews; but went
thenc unto a countri near to the wilder into a citi call
ephraim and there continu with hi discipl

11:55 and the jew passov wa nigh at hand: and mani went out of
the countri up to jerusalem befor the passov to purifi themselv

11:56 then sought they for jesu and spake among themselv as they
stood in the templ what think ye that he will not come to the
feast? 11:57 now both the chief priest and the pharise had given a
command that if ani man knew where he were he should shew it
that they might take him

12:1 then jesu six day befor the passov came to bethani where
lazaru wa which had been dead whom he rais from the dead

12:2 there they made him a supper; and martha served: but lazaru wa
one of them that sat at the tabl with him

12:3 then took mari a pound of ointment of spikenard veri costli and
anoint the feet of jesu and wipe hi feet with her hair: and the
hous wa fill with the odour of the ointment

12:4 then saith one of hi discipl juda iscariot simon son
which should betray him 12:5 whi wa not thi ointment sold for three
hundr penc and given to the poor? 12:6 thi he said not that he
care for the poor; but becaus he wa a thief and had the bag and
bare what wa put therein

12:7 then said jesu let her alone: against the day of my buri
hath she kept thi

12:8 for the poor alway ye have with you; but me ye have not alway

12:9 much peopl of the jew therefor knew that he wa there: and
they came not for jesu sake onli but that they might see lazaru
also whom he had rais from the dead

12:10 but the chief priest consult that they might put lazaru also
to death; 12:11 becaus that by reason of him mani of the jew went
away and believ on jesu

12:12 on the next day much peopl that were come to the feast when
they heard that jesu wa come to jerusalem 12:13 took branch of
palm tree and went forth to meet him and cri hosanna: bless is
the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord

12:14 and jesu when he had found a young ass sat thereon; as it is
written 12:15 fear not daughter of sion: behold thi king cometh
sit on an asss colt

12:16 these thing understood not hi discipl at the first: but when
jesu wa glorifi then rememb they that these thing were
written of him and that they had done these thing unto him

12:17 the peopl therefor that wa with him when he call lazaru
out of hi grave and rais him from the dead bare record

12:18 for thi caus the peopl also met him for that they heard that
he had done thi miracl

12:19 the pharise therefor said among themselv perceiv ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold the world is gone after him

12:20 and there were certain greek among them that came up to worship
at the feast: 12:21 the same came therefor to philip which wa of
bethsaida of galile and desir him say sir we would see
jesu

12:22 philip cometh and telleth andrew: and again andrew and philip
tell jesu

12:23 and jesu answer them say the hour is come that the son
of man should be glorifi

12:24 verili verili i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die it abideth alone: but if it die it bringeth forth
much fruit

12:25 he that loveth hi life shall lose it; and he that hateth hi
life in thi world shall keep it unto life etern

12:26 if ani man serv me let him follow me; and where i am there
shall also my servant be: if ani man serv me him will my father
honour

12:27 now is my soul troubled; and what shall i say? father save me
from thi hour: but for thi caus came i unto thi hour

12:28 father glorifi thi name then came there a voic from heaven
say i have both glorifi it and will glorifi it again

12:29 the peopl therefor that stood by and heard it said that it
thundered: other said an angel spake to him

12:30 jesu answer and said thi voic came not becaus of me but
for your sake

12:31 now is the judgment of thi world: now shall the princ of thi
world be cast out

12:32 and i if i be lift up from the earth will draw all men unto
me

12:33 thi he said signifi what death he should die

12:34 the peopl answer him we have heard out of the law that
christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou the son of man must be
lift up? who is thi son of man? 12:35 then jesu said unto them
yet a littl while is the light with you

walk while ye have the light lest dark come upon you: for he that
walketh in dark knoweth not whither he goeth

12:36 while ye have light believ in the light that ye may be the
children of light these thing spake jesu and depart and did
hide himself from them

12:37 but though he had done so mani miracl befor them yet they
believ not on him: 12:38 that the say of esaia the prophet might
be fulfil which he spake lord who hath believ our report? and
to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed? 12:39 therefor they
could not believ becaus that esaia said again 12:40 he hath
blind their eye and harden their heart; that they should not see
with their eye nor understand with their heart and be convert
and i should heal them

12:41 these thing said esaia when he saw hi glori and spake of
him

12:42 nevertheless among the chief ruler also mani believ on him;
but becaus of the pharise they did not confess him lest they
should be put out of the synagogue: 12:43 for they love the prais of
men more than the prais of god

12:44 jesu cri and said he that believeth on me believeth not on
me but on him that sent me

12:45 and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me

12:46 i am come a light into the world that whosoev believeth on me
should not abid in dark

12:47 and if ani man hear my word and believ not i judg him not:
for i came not to judg the world but to save the world

12:48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my word hath one that
judgeth him: the word that i have spoken the same shall judg him in
the last day

12:49 for i have not spoken of myself; but the father which sent me
he gave me a command what i should say and what i should speak

12:50 and i know that hi command is life everlasting: whatsoev
i speak therefor even as the father said unto me so i speak

13:1 now befor the feast of the passov when jesu knew that hi
hour wa come that he should depart out of thi world unto the father
have love hi own which were in the world he love them unto the
end

13:2 and supper be end the devil have now put into the heart
of juda iscariot simon son to betray him; 13:3 jesu know that
the father had given all thing into hi hand and that he wa come
from god and went to god; 13:4 he riseth from supper and laid asid
hi garments; and took a towel and gird himself

13:5 after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the
discipl feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he wa
gird

13:6 then cometh he to simon peter: and peter saith unto him lord
dost thou wash my feet? 13:7 jesu answer and said unto him what i
do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereaft

13:8 peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesu
answer him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me

13:9 simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet onli but also my
hand and my head

13:10 jesu saith to him he that is wash needeth not save to wash
hi feet but is clean everi whit: and ye are clean but not all

13:11 for he knew who should betray him; therefor said he ye are not
all clean

13:12 so after he had wash their feet and had taken hi garment
and wa set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to
you? 13:13 ye call me master and lord: and ye say well; for so i am

13:14 if i then your lord and master have wash your feet; ye also
ought to wash one anoth feet

13:15 for i have given you an exampl that ye should do as i have
done to you

13:16 verili verili i say unto you the servant is not greater than
hi lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him

13:17 if ye know these thing happi are ye if ye do them

13:18 i speak not of you all: i know whom i have chosen: but that the
scriptur may be fulfil he that eateth bread with me hath lift
up hi heel against me

13:19 now i tell you befor it come that when it is come to pass ye
may believ that i am he

13:20 verili verili i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoev i
send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
me

13:21 when jesu had thu said he wa troubl in spirit and
testifi and said verili verili i say unto you that one of you
shall betray me

13:22 then the discipl look one on anoth doubt of whom he
spake

13:23 now there wa lean on jesu bosom one of hi discipl whom
jesu love

13:24 simon peter therefor beckon to him that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake

13:25 he then lie on jesu breast saith unto him lord who is it?
13:26 jesu answer he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i
have dip it and when he had dip the sop he gave it to juda
iscariot the son of simon

13:27 and after the sop satan enter into him then said jesu unto
him that thou doest do quickli

13:28 now no man at the tabl knew for what intent he spake thi unto
him

13:29 for some of them thought becaus juda had the bag that jesu
had said unto him buy those thing that we have need of against the
feast; or that he should give someth to the poor

13:30 he then have receiv the sop went immedi out: and it wa
night

13:31 therefor when he wa gone out jesu said now is the son of
man glorifi and god is glorifi in him

13:32 if god be glorifi in him god shall also glorifi him in
himself and shall straightway glorifi him

13:33 littl children yet a littl while i am with you ye shall seek
me: and as i said unto the jew whither i go ye cannot come; so now
i say to you

13:34 a new command i give unto you that ye love one another; as
i have love you that ye also love one anoth

13:35 by thi shall all men know that ye are my discipl if ye have
love one to anoth

13:36 simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou? jesu
answer him whither i go thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterward

13:37 peter said unto him lord whi cannot i follow thee now? i will
lay down my life for thi sake

13:38 jesu answer him wilt thou lay down thi life for my sake?
verili verili i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou
hast deni me thrice

14:1 let not your heart be troubled: ye believ in god believ also
in me

14:2 in my father hous are mani mansions: if it were not so i
would have told you i go to prepar a place for you

14:3 and if i go and prepar a place for you i will come again and
receiv you unto myself; that where i am there ye may be also

14:4 and whither i go ye know and the way ye know

14:5 thoma saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest; and
how can we know the way? 14:6 jesu saith unto him i am the way the
truth and the life: no man cometh unto the father but by me

14:7 if ye had known me ye should have known my father also: and from
henceforth ye know him and have seen him

14:8 philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth
us

14:9 jesu saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet
hast thou not known me philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the
father; and how sayest thou then shew us the father? 14:10 believest
thou not that i am in the father and the father in me? the word
that i speak unto you i speak not of myself: but the father that
dwelleth in me he doeth the work

14:11 believ me that i am in the father and the father in me: or
els believ me for the veri work sake

14:12 verili verili i say unto you he that believeth on me the
work that i do shall he do also; and greater work than these shall
he do; becaus i go unto my father

14:13 and whatsoev ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the
father may be glorifi in the son

14:14 if ye shall ask ani thing in my name i will do it

14:15 if ye love me keep my command

14:16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you anoth
comfort that he may abid with you for ever; 14:17 even the spirit
of truth; whom the world cannot receiv becaus it seeth him not
neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you and
shall be in you

14:18 i will not leav you comfortless: i will come to you

14:19 yet a littl while and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
me: becaus i live ye shall live also

14:20 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me
and i in you

14:21 he that hath my command and keepeth them he it is that
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be love of my father and i
will love him and will manifest myself to him

14:22 juda saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world? 14:23 jesu
answer and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words:
and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our
abod with him

14:24 he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which
ye hear is not mine but the father which sent me

14:25 these thing have i spoken unto you be yet present with you

14:26 but the comfort which is the holi ghost whom the father will
send in my name he shall teach you all thing and bring all thing
to your remembr whatsoev i have said unto you

14:27 peac i leav with you my peac i give unto you: not as the
world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubl neither
let it be afraid

14:28 ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again
unto you if ye love me ye would rejoic becaus i said i go unto
the father: for my father is greater than i

14:29 and now i have told you befor it come to pass that when it is
come to pass ye might believ

14:30 hereaft i will not talk much with you: for the princ of thi
world cometh and hath noth in me

14:31 but that the world may know that i love the father; and as the
father gave me command even so i do aris let us go henc

15:1 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman

15:2 everi branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
everi branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring
forth more fruit

15:3 now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you

15:4 abid in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself except it abid in the vine; no more can ye except ye abid
in me

15:5 i am the vine ye are the branches: he that abideth in me and i
in him the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
noth

15:6 if a man abid not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is
withered; and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they
are burn

15:7 if ye abid in me and my word abid in you ye shall ask what
ye will and it shall be done unto you

15:8 herein is my father glorifi that ye bear much fruit; so shall
ye be my discipl

15:9 as the father hath love me so have i love you: continu ye in
my love

15:10 if ye keep my command ye shall abid in my love; even as i
have kept my father command and abid in hi love

15:11 these thing have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in
you and that your joy might be full

15:12 thi is my command that ye love one anoth as i have
love you

15:13 greater love hath no man than thi that a man lay down hi life
for hi friend

15:14 ye are my friend if ye do whatsoev i command you

15:15 henceforth i call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what hi lord doeth: but i have call you friends; for all thing
that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you

15:16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordain you
that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should
remain: that whatsoev ye shall ask of the father in my name he may
give it you

15:17 these thing i command you that ye love one anoth

15:18 if the world hate you ye know that it hate me befor it hate
you

15:19 if ye were of the world the world would love hi own: but
becaus ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the
world therefor the world hateth you

15:20 rememb the word that i said unto you the servant is not
greater than hi lord if they have persecut me they will also
persecut you; if they have kept my say they will keep your also

15:21 but all these thing will they do unto you for my name sake
becaus they know not him that sent me

15:22 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin:
but now they have no cloak for their sin

15:23 he that hateth me hateth my father also

15:24 if i had not done among them the work which none other man did
they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hate both me
and my father

15:25 but thi cometh to pass that the word might be fulfil that
is written in their law they hate me without a caus

15:26 but when the comfort is come whom i will send unto you from
the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the
father he shall testifi of me: 15:27 and ye also shall bear wit
becaus ye have been with me from the begin

16:1 these thing have i spoken unto you that ye should not be
offend

16:2 they shall put you out of the synagogues: yea the time cometh
that whosoev killeth you will think that he doeth god servic

16:3 and these thing will they do unto you becaus they have not
known the father nor me

16:4 but these thing have i told you that when the time shall come
ye may rememb that i told you of them and these thing i said not
unto you at the begin becaus i wa with you

16:5 but now i go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
me whither goest thou? 16:6 but becaus i have said these thing
unto you sorrow hath fill your heart

16:7 nevertheless i tell you the truth; it is expedi for you that i
go away: for if i go not away the comfort will not come unto you;
but if i depart i will send him unto you

16:8 and when he is come he will reprov the world of sin and of
righteous and of judgment: 16:9 of sin becaus they believ not
on me; 16:10 of righteous becaus i go to my father and ye see
me no more; 16:11 of judgment becaus the princ of thi world is
judg

16:12 i have yet mani thing to say unto you but ye cannot bear them
now

16:13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guid you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoev he
shall hear that shall he speak: and he will shew you thing to come

16:14 he shall glorifi me: for he shall receiv of mine and shall
shew it unto you

16:15 all thing that the father hath are mine: therefor said i that
he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you

16:16 a littl while and ye shall not see me: and again a littl
while and ye shall see me becaus i go to the father

16:17 then said some of hi discipl among themselv what is thi
that he saith unto us a littl while and ye shall not see me: and
again a littl while and ye shall see me: and becaus i go to the
father? 16:18 they said therefor what is thi that he saith a
littl while? we cannot tell what he saith

16:19 now jesu knew that they were desir to ask him and said unto
them do ye enquir among yourselv of that i said a littl while
and ye shall not see me: and again a littl while and ye shall see
me? 16:20 verili verili i say unto you that ye shall weep and
lament but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrow but
your sorrow shall be turn into joy

16:21 a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow becaus her hour is
come: but as soon as she is deliv of the child she remembereth no
more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world

16:22 and ye now therefor have sorrow: but i will see you again and
your heart shall rejoic and your joy no man taketh from you

16:23 and in that day ye shall ask me noth verili verili i say
unto you whatsoev ye shall ask the father in my name he will give
it you

16:24 hitherto have ye ask noth in my name: ask and ye shall
receiv that your joy may be full

16:25 these thing have i spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverb but i shall
shew you plainli of the father

16:26 at that day ye shall ask in my name: and i say not unto you
that i will pray the father for you: 16:27 for the father himself
loveth you becaus ye have love me and have believ that i came
out from god

16:28 i came forth from the father and am come into the world: again
i leav the world and go to the father

16:29 hi discipl said unto him lo now speakest thou plainli and
speakest no proverb

16:30 now are we sure that thou knowest all thing and needest not
that ani man should ask thee: by thi we believ that thou camest
forth from god

16:31 jesu answer them do ye now believe? 16:32 behold the hour
cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scatter everi man to hi
own and shall leav me alone: and yet i am not alon becaus the
father is with me

16:33 these thing i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have
peac

in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; i have
overcom the world

17:1 these word spake jesu and lift up hi eye to heaven and
said father the hour is come; glorifi thi son that thi son also may
glorifi thee: 17:2 as thou hast given him power over all flesh that
he should give etern life to as mani as thou hast given him

17:3 and thi is life etern that they might know thee the onli true
god and jesu christ whom thou hast sent

17:4 i have glorifi thee on the earth: i have finish the work
which thou gavest me to do

17:5 and now o father glorifi thou me with thine own self with the
glori which i had with thee befor the world wa

17:6 i have manifest thi name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world: thine they were and thou gavest them me; and they have
kept thi word

17:7 now they have known that all thing whatsoev thou hast given me
are of thee

17:8 for i have given unto them the word which thou gavest me; and
they have receiv them and have known sure that i came out from
thee and they have believ that thou didst send me

17:9 i pray for them: i pray not for the world but for them which
thou hast given me; for they are thine

17:10 and all mine are thine and thine are mine; and i am glorifi
in them

17:11 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world
and i come to thee holi father keep through thine own name those
whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are

17:12 while i wa with them in the world i kept them in thi name:
those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but
the son of perdition; that the scriptur might be fulfil

17:13 and now come i to thee; and these thing i speak in the world
that they might have my joy fulfil in themselv

17:14 i have given them thi word; and the world hath hate them
becaus they are not of the world even as i am not of the world

17:15 i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil

17:16 they are not of the world even as i am not of the world

17:17 sanctifi them through thi truth: thi word is truth

17:18 as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent
them into the world

17:19 and for their sake i sanctifi myself that they also might be
sanctifi through the truth

17:20 neither pray i for these alon but for them also which shall
believ on me through their word; 17:21 that they all may be one; as
thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in
us: that the world may believ that thou hast sent me

17:22 and the glori which thou gavest me i have given them; that they
may be one even as we are one: 17:23 i in them and thou in me that
they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me and hast love them as thou hast love me

17:24 father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with
me where i am; that they may behold my glori which thou hast given
me: for thou lovedst me befor the foundat of the world

17:25 o righteou father the world hath not known thee: but i have
known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me

17:26 and i have declar unto them thi name and will declar it:
that the love wherewith thou hast love me may be in them and i in

18:29 pilat then went out unto them and said what accus bring

the chief priest have deliv thee unto me: what hast thou done?
18:36 jesu answer my kingdom is not of thi world: if my kingdom
were of thi world then would my servant fight that i should not be

18:37 pilat therefor said unto him art thou a king then? jesu
answer thou sayest that i am a king to thi end wa i born and
for thi caus came i into the world that i should bear wit unto

18:38 pilat saith unto him what is truth? and when he had said thi

18:39 but ye have a custom that i should releas unto you one at the

19:12 and from thenceforth pilat sought to releas him: but the jew
cri out say if thou let thi man go thou art not caesar
friend: whosoev maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar

19:13 when pilat therefor heard that say he brought jesu forth
and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is call the

19:22 pilat answer what i have written i have written

19:23 then the soldier when they had crucifi jesu took hi
garment and made four part to everi soldier a part; and also hi

19:26 when jesu therefor saw hi mother and the discipl stand

19:31 the jew therefor becaus it wa the prepar that the
bodi should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day (for that
sabbath day wa an high day) besought pilat that their leg might be
broken and that they might be taken away

19:32 then came the soldier and brake the leg of the first and of

19:33 but when they came to jesu and saw that he wa dead alreadi
they brake not hi legs: 19:34 but one of the soldier with a spear

19:36 for these thing were done that the scriptur should be

19:38 and after thi joseph of arimathaea be a discipl of jesu
but secretli for fear of the jew besought pilat that he might take
away the bodi of jesus: and pilat gave him leav he came therefor
and took the bodi of jesu

19:39 and there came also nicodemu which at the first came to jesu
by night and brought a mixtur of myrrh and alo about an hundr
pound weight

19:40 then took they the bodi of jesu and wound it in linen cloth
with the spice as the manner of the jew is to buri

19:41 now in the place where he wa crucifi there wa a garden; and
in the garden a new sepulchr wherein wa never man yet laid

19:42 there laid they jesu therefor becaus of the jew prepar

20:1 the first day of the week cometh mari magdalen earli when it

20:2 then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other
discipl whom jesu love and saith unto them they have taken away
the lord out of the sepulchr and we know not where they have laid

20:3 peter therefor went forth and that other discipl and came to

20:4 so they ran both together: and the other discipl did outrun
peter and came first to the sepulchr

20:5 and he stoop down and look in saw the linen cloth

20:6 then cometh simon peter follow him and went into the
sepulchr and seeth the linen cloth lie 20:7 and the napkin that

togeth in a place by itself

20:8 then went in also that other discipl which came first to the
sepulchr and he saw and believ

20:9 for as yet they knew not the scriptur that he must rise again
from the dead

20:10 then the discipl went away again unto their own home

20:11 but mari stood without at the sepulchr weeping: and as she
wept she stoop down and look into the sepulchr 20:12 and seeth
two angel in white sit the one at the head and the other at the
feet where the bodi of jesu had lain

20:13 and they say unto her woman whi weepest thou? she saith unto
them becaus they have taken away my lord and i know not where they

20:14 and when she had thu said she turn herself back and saw
jesu stand and knew not that it wa jesu

20:15 jesu saith unto her woman whi weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? she suppos him to be the garden saith unto him sir if

20:16 jesu saith unto her mari she turn herself and saith unto

20:17 jesu saith unto her touch me not; for i am not yet ascend to
my father: but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my
father and your father; and to my god and your god

20:18 mari magdalen came and told the discipl that she had seen the
lord and that he had spoken these thing unto her

20:19 then the same day at even be the first day of the week
when the door were shut where the discipl were assembl for fear
of the jew came jesu and stood in the midst and saith unto them
peac be unto you

20:20 and when he had so said he shew unto them hi hand and hi
side

then were the discipl glad when they saw the lord

20:21 then said jesu to them again peac be unto you: as my father
hath sent me even so send i you

20:22 and when he had said thi he breath on them and saith unto
them receiv ye the holi ghost: 20:23 whose soever sin ye remit
they are remit unto them; and whose soever sin ye retain they are
retain

20:24 but thoma one of the twelv call didymu wa not with them
when jesu came

20:25 the other discipl therefor said unto him we have seen the
lord

but he said unto them except i shall see in hi hand the print of
the nail and put my finger into the print of the nail and thrust
my hand into hi side i will not believ

20:26 and after eight day again hi discipl were within and thoma

midst and said peac be unto you

20:27 then saith he to thoma reach hither thi finger and behold my
hands; and reach hither thi hand and thrust it into my side: and be
not faithless but believ

20:28 and thoma answer and said unto him my lord and my god

20:29 jesu saith unto him thoma becaus thou hast seen me thou
hast believed: bless are they that have not seen and yet have
believ

20:30 and mani other sign truli did jesu in the presenc of hi
discipl which are not written in thi book: 20:31 but these are
written that ye might believ that jesu is the christ the son of
god; and that believ ye might have life through hi name

21:1 after these thing jesu shew himself again to the discipl at
the sea of tiberias; and on thi wise shew he himself

21:2 there were togeth simon peter and thoma call didymu and
nathanael of cana in galile and the son of zebede and two other
of hi discipl

21:3 simon peter saith unto them i go a fish they say unto him
we also go with thee they went forth and enter into a ship
immediately; and that night they caught noth

21:4 but when the morn wa now come jesu stood on the shore: but
the discipl knew not that it wa jesu

21:5 then jesu saith unto them children have ye ani meat? they
answer him no

21:6 and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the
ship and ye shall find they cast therefor and now they were not
abl to draw it for the multitud of fish

21:7 therefor that discipl whom jesu love saith unto peter it is
the lord now when simon peter heard that it wa the lord he girt hi
fisher coat unto him (for he wa naked) and did cast himself into
the sea

21:8 and the other discipl came in a littl ship; (for they were not
far from land but as it were two hundr cubits) drag the net
with fish

21:9 as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coal
there and fish laid thereon and bread

21:10 jesu saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now
caught

21:11 simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great
fish an hundr and fifti and three: and for all there were so
mani yet wa not the net broken

21:12 jesu saith unto them come and dine and none of the discipl
durst ask him who art thou? know that it wa the lord

21:13 jesu then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish
likewis

21:14 thi is now the third time that jesu shew himself to hi
discipl after that he wa risen from the dead

21:15 so when they had dine jesu saith to simon peter simon son
of jona lovest thou me more than these? he saith unto him yea
lord; thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lamb

21:16 he saith to him again the second time simon son of jona
lovest thou me? he saith unto him yea lord; thou knowest that i love
thee he saith unto him feed my sheep

21:17 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jona lovest
thou me? peter wa griev becaus he said unto him the third time
lovest thou me? and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things;
thou knowest that i love thee jesu saith unto him feed my sheep

21:18 verili verili i say unto thee when thou wast young thou
girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou
shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thi hand and anoth shall
gird thee and carri thee whither thou wouldest not

21:19 thi spake he signifi by what death he should glorifi god
and when he had spoken thi he saith unto him follow me

21:20 then peter turn about seeth the discipl whom jesu love
following; which also lean on hi breast at supper and said lord
which is he that betrayeth thee? 21:21 peter see him saith to
jesu lord and what shall thi man do? 21:22 jesu saith unto him
if i will that he tarri till i come what is that to thee? follow thou
me

21:23 then went thi say abroad among the brethren that that
discipl should not die: yet jesu said not unto him he shall not
die; but if i will that he tarri till i come what is that to thee?
21:24 thi is the discipl which testifieth of these thing and wrote
these things: and we know that hi testimoni is true

21:25 and there are also mani other thing which jesu did the which
if they should be written everi one i suppos that even the world
itself could not contain the book that should be written amen




the act of the apostl


1:1 the former treatis have i made o theophilu of all that jesu
began both to do and teach 1:2 until the day in which he wa taken
up after that he through the holi ghost had given command unto
the apostl whom he had chosen: 1:3 to whom also he shew himself
aliv after hi passion by mani infal proof be seen of them
forti day and speak of the thing pertain to the kingdom of
god: 1:4 and be assembl togeth with them command them that
they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promis of the
father which saith he ye have heard of me

1:5 for john truli baptiz with water; but ye shall be baptiz with
the holi ghost not mani day henc

1:6 when they therefor were come togeth they ask of him say
lord wilt thou at thi time restor again the kingdom to israel? 1:7
and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or the
season which the father hath put in hi own power

1:8 but ye shall receiv power after that the holi ghost is come upon
you: and ye shall be wit unto me both in jerusalem and in all
judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth

1:9 and when he had spoken these thing while they beheld he wa
taken up; and a cloud receiv him out of their sight

1:10 and while they look stedfastli toward heaven as he went up
behold two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11 which also said
ye men of galile whi stand ye gaze up into heaven? thi same
jesu which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven

1:12 then return they unto jerusalem from the mount call olivet
which is from jerusalem a sabbath day journey

1:13 and when they were come in they went up into an upper room
where abod both peter and jame and john and andrew philip and
thoma bartholomew and matthew jame the son of alphaeu and simon
zelot and juda the brother of jame

1:14 these all continu with one accord in prayer and supplic
with the women and mari the mother of jesu and with hi brethren

1:15 and in those day peter stood up in the midst of the discipl
and said (the number of name togeth were about an hundr and
twenty) 1:16 men and brethren thi scriptur must need have been
fulfil which the holi ghost by the mouth of david spake befor
concern juda which wa guid to them that took jesu

1:17 for he wa number with us and had obtain part of thi
ministri

1:18 now thi man purchas a field with the reward of iniquity; and
fall headlong he burst asund in the midst and all hi bowel
gush out

1:19 and it wa known unto all the dweller at jerusalem; insomuch as
that field is call in their proper tongu aceldama that is to say
the field of blood

1:20 for it is written in the book of psalm let hi habit be
desol and let no man dwell therein: and hi bishoprick let anoth
take

1:21 wherefor of these men which have compani with us all the time
that the lord jesu went in and out among us 1:22 begin from the
baptism of john unto that same day that he wa taken up from us must
one be ordain to be a wit with us of hi resurrect

1:23 and they appoint two joseph call barsaba who wa surnam
justu and matthia

1:24 and they pray and said thou lord which knowest the heart
of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen 1:25 that he
may take part of thi ministri and apostleship from which juda by
transgress fell that he might go to hi own place

1:26 and they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon matthias;
and he wa number with the eleven apostl

2:1 and when the day of pentecost wa fulli come they were all with
one accord in one place

2:2 and suddenli there came a sound from heaven as of a rush mighti
wind and it fill all the hous where they were sit

2:3 and there appear unto them cloven tongu like as of fire and
it sat upon each of them

2:4 and they were all fill with the holi ghost and began to speak
with other tongu as the spirit gave them utter

2:5 and there were dwell at jerusalem jew devout men out of
everi nation under heaven

2:6 now when thi wa nois abroad the multitud came togeth and
were confound becaus that everi man heard them speak in hi own
languag

2:7 and they were all amaz and marvel say one to anoth
behold are not all these which speak galilaeans? 2:8 and how hear we
everi man in our own tongu wherein we were born? 2:9 parthian and
mede and elamit and the dweller in mesopotamia and in judaea
and cappadocia in pontu and asia 2:10 phrygia and pamphylia in
egypt and in the part of libya about cyren and stranger of rome
jew and proselyt 2:11 crete and arabian we do hear them speak
in our tongu the wonder work of god

2:12 and they were all amaz and were in doubt say one to
anoth what meaneth this? 2:13 other mock said these men are
full of new wine

2:14 but peter stand up with the eleven lift up hi voic and
said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem
be thi known unto you and hearken to my words: 2:15 for these are
not drunken as ye suppos see it is but the third hour of the
day

2:16 but thi is that which wa spoken by the prophet joel; 2:17 and
it shall come to pass in the last day saith god i will pour out of
my spirit upon all flesh: and your son and your daughter shall
prophesi and your young men shall see vision and your old men shall
dream dreams: 2:18 and on my servant and on my handmaiden i will
pour out in those day of my spirit; and they shall prophesy: 2:19 and
i will shew wonder in heaven abov and sign in the earth beneath;
blood and fire and vapour of smoke: 2:20 the sun shall be turn
into dark and the moon into blood befor the great and notabl
day of the lord come: 2:21 and it shall come to pass that whosoev
shall call on the name of the lord shall be save

2:22 ye men of israel hear these words; jesu of nazareth a man
approv of god among you by miracl and wonder and sign which god
did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselv also know: 2:23 him
be deliv by the determin counsel and foreknowledg of god
ye have taken and by wick hand have crucifi and slain: 2:24 whom
god hath rais up have loos the pain of death: becaus it wa
not possibl that he should be holden of it

2:25 for david speaketh concern him i foresaw the lord alway
befor my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be
moved: 2:26 therefor did my heart rejoic and my tongu wa glad;
moreov also my flesh shall rest in hope: 2:27 becaus thou wilt not
leav my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holi one to see
corrupt

2:28 thou hast made known to me the way of life; thou shalt make me
full of joy with thi counten

2:29 men and brethren let me freeli speak unto you of the patriarch
david that he is both dead and buri and hi sepulchr is with us
unto thi day

2:30 therefor be a prophet and know that god had sworn with an
oath to him that of the fruit of hi loin accord to the flesh
he would rais up christ to sit on hi throne; 2:31 he see thi
befor spake of the resurrect of christ that hi soul wa not left
in hell neither hi flesh did see corrupt

2:32 thi jesu hath god rais up whereof we all are wit

2:33 therefor be by the right hand of god exalt and have
receiv of the father the promis of the holi ghost he hath shed
forth thi which ye now see and hear

2:34 for david is not ascend into the heavens: but he saith himself
the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 2:35 until i
make thi foe thi footstool

2:36 therefor let all the hous of israel know assuredli that god
hath made the same jesu whom ye have crucifi both lord and
christ

2:37 now when they heard thi they were prick in their heart and
said unto peter and to the rest of the apostl men and brethren
what shall we do? 2:38 then peter said unto them repent and be
baptiz everi one of you in the name of jesu christ for the
remiss of sin and ye shall receiv the gift of the holi ghost

2:39 for the promis is unto you and to your children and to all
that are afar off even as mani as the lord our god shall call

2:40 and with mani other word did he testifi and exhort say save

2:41 then they that gladli receiv hi word were baptized: and the
same day there were ad unto them about three thousand soul

2:42 and they continu stedfastli in the apostl doctrin and
fellowship and in break of bread and in prayer

2:43 and fear came upon everi soul: and mani wonder and sign were
done by the apostl

2:44 and all that believ were togeth and had all thing common;
2:45 and sold their possess and good and part them to all men
as everi man had need

2:46 and they continu daili with one accord in the templ and

3:1 now peter and john went up togeth into the templ at the hour of

3:2 and a certain man lame from hi mother womb wa carri whom
they laid daili at the gate of the templ which is call beauti

3:4 and peter fasten hi eye upon him with john said look on

3:5 and he gave heed unto them expect to receiv someth of

3:6 then peter said silver and gold have i none; but such as i have

immedi hi feet and ankl bone receiv strength

3:9 and all the peopl saw him walk and prais god: 3:10 and they
knew that it wa he which sat for alm at the beauti gate of the
temple: and they were fill with wonder and amaz at that which
had happen unto him

3:11 and as the lame man which wa heal held peter and john all the
peopl ran togeth unto them in the porch that is call solomon
greatli wonder

3:12 and when peter saw it he answer unto the peopl ye men of
israel whi marvel ye at this? or whi look ye so earnestli on us as
though by our own power or holi we had made thi man to walk?
3:13 the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our
father hath glorifi hi son jesus; whom ye deliv up and
deni him in the presenc of pilat when he wa determin to let
him go

3:14 but ye deni the holi one and the just and desir a murder
to be grant unto you; 3:15 and kill the princ of life whom god
hath rais from the dead; whereof we are wit

3:16 and hi name through faith in hi name hath made thi man strong
whom ye see and know: yea the faith which is by him hath given him
thi perfect sound in the presenc of you all

3:17 and now brethren i wot that through ignor ye did it as did
also your ruler

3:18 but those thing which god befor had shew by the mouth of all
hi prophet that christ should suffer he hath so fulfil

3:19 repent ye therefor and be convert that your sin may be
blot out when the time of refresh shall come from the presenc
of the lord

3:20 and he shall send jesu christ which befor wa preach unto
you: 3:21 whom the heaven must receiv until the time of restitut
of all thing which god hath spoken by the mouth of all hi holi
prophet sinc the world began

3:22 for mose truli said unto the father a prophet shall the lord
your god rais up unto you of your brethren like unto me; him shall
ye hear in all thing whatsoev he shall say unto you

3:23 and it shall come to pass that everi soul which will not hear
that prophet shall be destroy from among the peopl

3:24 yea and all the prophet from samuel and those that follow
after as mani as have spoken have likewis foretold of these day

3:25 ye are the children of the prophet and of the coven which
god made with our father say unto abraham and in thi seed shall
all the kindr of the earth be bless

3:26 unto you first god have rais up hi son jesu sent him to
bless you in turn away everi one of you from hi iniqu

4:1 and as they spake unto the peopl the priest and the captain of
the templ and the sadduce came upon them 4:2 be griev that
they taught the peopl and preach through jesu the resurrect
from the dead

4:3 and they laid hand on them and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it wa now eventid

4:4 howbeit mani of them which heard the word believed; and the number
of the men wa about five thousand

4:5 and it came to pass on the morrow that their ruler and elder
and scribe 4:6 and anna the high priest and caiapha and john
and alexand and as mani as were of the kindr of the high priest
were gather togeth at jerusalem

4:7 and when they had set them in the midst they ask by what
power or by what name have ye done this? 4:8 then peter fill
with the holi ghost said unto them ye ruler of the peopl and
elder of israel 4:9 if we thi day be examin of the good deed done
to the impot man by what mean he is made whole; 4:10 be it known
unto you all and to all the peopl of israel that by the name of
jesu christ of nazareth whom ye crucifi whom god rais from the
dead even by him doth thi man stand here befor you whole

4:11 thi is the stone which wa set at nought of you builder which
is becom the head of the corner

4:12 neither is there salvat in ani other: for there is none other
name under heaven given among men wherebi we must be save

4:13 now when they saw the bold of peter and john and perceiv
that they were unlearn and ignor men they marvelled; and they
took knowledg of them that they had been with jesu

4:14 and behold the man which wa heal stand with them they
could say noth against it

4:15 but when they had command them to go asid out of the council
they confer among themselv 4:16 say what shall we do to
these men? for that inde a notabl miracl hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem; and we cannot deni it

4:17 but that it spread no further among the peopl let us straitli
threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in thi name

4:18 and they call them and command them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of jesu

4:19 but peter and john answer and said unto them whether it be
right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god
judg ye

4:20 for we cannot but speak the thing which we have seen and heard

4:21 so when they had further threaten them they let them go
find noth how they might punish them becaus of the people: for
all men glorifi god for that which wa done

4:22 for the man wa abov forti year old on whom thi miracl of
heal wa shew

4:23 and be let go they went to their own compani and report
all that the chief priest and elder had said unto them

4:24 and when they heard that they lift up their voic to god with
one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and
earth and the sea and all that in them is: 4:25 who by the mouth of
thi servant david hast said whi did the heathen rage and the peopl
imagin vain things? 4:26 the king of the earth stood up and the
ruler were gather togeth against the lord and against hi
christ

4:27 for of a truth against thi holi child jesu whom thou hast
anoint both herod and pontiu pilat with the gentil and the
peopl of israel were gather togeth 4:28 for to do whatsoev
thi hand and thi counsel determin befor to be done

4:29 and now lord behold their threatenings: and grant unto thi
servant that with all bold they may speak thi word 4:30 by
stretch forth thine hand to heal; and that sign and wonder may be
done by the name of thi holi child jesu

4:31 and when they had pray the place wa shaken where they were
assembl together; and they were all fill with the holi ghost and
they spake the word of god with bold

4:32 and the multitud of them that believ were of one heart and of
one soul: neither said ani of them that ought of the thing which he
possess wa hi own; but they had all thing common

4:33 and with great power gave the apostl wit of the
resurrect of the lord jesus: and great grace wa upon them all

4:34 neither wa there ani among them that lacked: for as mani as were
possessor of land or hous sold them and brought the price of the
thing that were sold 4:35 and laid them down at the apostl feet:
and distribut wa made unto everi man accord as he had need

4:36 and jose who by the apostl wa surnam barnaba (which is
be interpret the son of consolation) a levit and of the
countri of cypru 4:37 have land sold it and brought the money
and laid it at the apostl feet

5:1 but a certain man name anania with sapphira hi wife sold a
possess 5:2 and kept back part of the price hi wife also be
privi to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostl
feet

5:3 but peter said anania whi hath satan fill thine heart to lie
to the holi ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land?
5:4 while it remain wa it not thine own? and after it wa sold
wa it not in thine own power? whi hast thou conceiv thi thing in
thine heart? thou hast not lie unto men but unto god

5:5 and anania hear these word fell down and gave up the ghost:
and great fear came on all them that heard these thing

5:6 and the young men aros wound him up and carri him out and
buri him

5:7 and it wa about the space of three hour after when hi wife
not know what wa done came in

5:8 and peter answer unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for
so much? and she said yea for so much

5:9 then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agre togeth
to tempt the spirit of the lord? behold the feet of them which have
buri thi husband are at the door and shall carri thee out

5:10 then fell she down straightway at hi feet and yield up the
ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead and carri
her forth buri her by her husband

5:11 and great fear came upon all the church and upon as mani as
heard these thing

5:12 and by the hand of the apostl were mani sign and wonder
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in
solomon porch

5:13 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the peopl
magnifi them

5:14 and believ were the more ad to the lord multitud both of
men and women) 5:15 insomuch that they brought forth the sick into
the street and laid them on bed and couch that at the least the
shadow of peter pass by might overshadow some of them

5:16 there came also a multitud out of the citi round about unto
jerusalem bring sick folk and them which were vex with unclean
spirits: and they were heal everi one

5:17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him
(which is the sect of the sadducees) and were fill with
indign 5:18 and laid their hand on the apostl and put them
in the common prison

5:19 but the angel of the lord by night open the prison door and
brought them forth and said 5:20 go stand and speak in the templ
to the peopl all the word of thi life

5:21 and when they heard that they enter into the templ earli in
the morn and taught but the high priest came and they that were
with him and call the council togeth and all the senat of the
children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought

5:22 but when the offic came and found them not in the prison
they return and told 5:23 say the prison truli found we shut
with all safeti and the keeper stand without befor the doors:
but when we had open we found no man within

5:24 now when the high priest and the captain of the templ and the
chief priest heard these thing they doubt of them whereunto thi
would grow

5:25 then came one and told them say behold the men whom ye put
in prison are stand in the templ and teach the peopl

5:26 then went the captain with the offic and brought them without
violence: for they fear the peopl lest they should have been
stone

5:27 and when they had brought them they set them befor the council:
and the high priest ask them 5:28 say did not we straitli
command you that ye should not teach in thi name? and behold ye
have fill jerusalem with your doctrin and intend to bring thi
man blood upon us

5:29 then peter and the other apostl answer and said we ought to
obey god rather than men

5:30 the god of our father rais up jesu whom ye slew and hang
on a tree

5:31 him hath god exalt with hi right hand to be a princ and a
saviour for to give repent to israel and forgiv of sin

5:32 and we are hi wit of these things; and so is also the holi
ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him

5:33 when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took
counsel to slay them

5:34 then stood there up one in the council a pharise name
gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reput among all the peopl
and command to put the apostl forth a littl space; 5:35 and said
unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselv what ye intend to
do as touch these men

5:36 for befor these day rose up theuda boast himself to be
somebody; to whom a number of men about four hundr join
themselves: who wa slain; and all as mani as obey him were
scatter and brought to nought

5:37 after thi man rose up juda of galile in the day of the
tax and drew away much peopl after him: he also perished; and
all even as mani as obey him were dispers

5:38 and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them
alone: for if thi counsel or thi work be of men it will come to
nought: 5:39 but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it; lest hapli
ye be found even to fight against god

5:40 and to him they agreed: and when they had call the apostl
and beaten them they command that they should not speak in the name
of jesu and let them go

5:41 and they depart from the presenc of the council rejoic
that they were count worthi to suffer shame for hi name

5:42 and daili in the templ and in everi hous they ceas not to
teach and preach jesu christ

6:1 and in those day when the number of the discipl wa
multipli there aros a murmur of the grecian against the
hebrew becaus their widow were neglect in the daili
ministr

6:2 then the twelv call the multitud of the discipl unto them
and said it is not reason that we should leav the word of god and
serv tabl

6:3 wherefor brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest
report full of the holi ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over
thi busi

6:4 but we will give ourselv continu to prayer and to the
ministri of the word

6:5 and the say pleas the whole multitude: and they chose
stephen a man full of faith and of the holi ghost and philip and
prochoru and nicanor and timon and parmena and nicola a
proselyt of antioch: 6:6 whom they set befor the apostles: and when
they had pray they laid their hand on them

6:7 and the word of god increased; and the number of the discipl
multipli in jerusalem greatly; and a great compani of the priest
were obedi to the faith

6:8 and stephen full of faith and power did great wonder and
miracl among the peopl

6:9 then there aros certain of the synagogu which is call the
synagogu of the libertin and cyrenian and alexandrian and of
them of cilicia and of asia disput with stephen

6:10 and they were not abl to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake

6:11 then they suborn men which said we have heard him speak
blasphem word against mose and against god

6:12 and they stir up the peopl and the elder and the scribe
and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
6:13 and set up fals wit which said thi man ceaseth not to
speak blasphem word against thi holi place and the law: 6:14 for
we have heard him say that thi jesu of nazareth shall destroy thi
place and shall chang the custom which mose deliv us

6:15 and all that sat in the council look stedfastli on him saw
hi face as it had been the face of an angel

7:1 then said the high priest are these thing so? 7:2 and he said
men brethren and father hearken; the god of glori appear unto
our father abraham when he wa in mesopotamia befor he dwelt in
charran 7:3 and said unto him get thee out of thi countri and from
thi kindr and come into the land which i shall shew thee

7:4 then came he out of the land of the chaldaean and dwelt in
charran: and from thenc when hi father wa dead he remov him
into thi land wherein ye now dwell

7:5 and he gave him none inherit in it no not so much as to set
hi foot on: yet he promis that he would give it to him for a
possess and to hi seed after him when as yet he had no child

7:6 and god spake on thi wise that hi seed should sojourn in a
strang land; and that they should bring them into bondag and
entreat them evil four hundr year

7:7 and the nation to whom they shall be in bondag will i judg said
god: and after that shall they come forth and serv me in thi place

7:8 and he gave him the coven of circumcision: and so abraham begat
isaac and circumcis him the eighth day; and isaac begat jacob; and
jacob begat the twelv patriarch

7:9 and the patriarch move with envi sold joseph into egypt: but
god wa with him 7:10 and deliv him out of all hi afflict
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt;
and he made him governor over egypt and all hi hous

7:11 now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan
and great affliction: and our father found no susten

7:12 but when jacob heard that there wa corn in egypt he sent out
our father first

7:13 and at the second time joseph wa made known to hi brethren; and
joseph kindr wa made known unto pharaoh

7:14 then sent joseph and call hi father jacob to him and all hi
kindr threescor and fifteen soul

7:15 so jacob went down into egypt and die he and our father
7:16 and were carri over into sychem and laid in the sepulchr that
abraham bought for a sum of money of the son of emmor the father of
sychem

7:17 but when the time of the promis drew nigh which god had sworn
to abraham the peopl grew and multipli in egypt 7:18 till anoth
king aros which knew not joseph

7:19 the same dealt subtilli with our kindr and evil entreat our
father so that they cast out their young children to the end they
might not live

7:20 in which time mose wa born and wa exceed fair and
nourish up in hi father hous three months: 7:21 and when he wa
cast out pharaoh daughter took him up and nourish him for her
own son

7:22 and mose wa learn in all the wisdom of the egyptian and wa
mighti in word and in deed

7:23 and when he wa full forti year old it came into hi heart to
visit hi brethren the children of israel

7:24 and see one of them suffer wrong he defend him and aveng
him that wa oppress and smote the egyptian: 7:25 for he suppos
hi brethren would have understood how that god by hi hand would
deliv them: but they understood not

7:26 and the next day he shew himself unto them as they strove and
would have set them at one again say sir ye are brethren; whi
do ye wrong one to another? 7:27 but he that did hi neighbour wrong
thrust him away say who made thee a ruler and a judg over us?
7:28 wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday? 7:29
then fled mose at thi say and wa a stranger in the land of
madian where he begat two son

7:30 and when forti year were expir there appear to him in the
wilder of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a
bush

7:31 when mose saw it he wonder at the sight: and as he drew near
to behold it the voic of the lord came unto him 7:32 say i am
the god of thi father the god of abraham and the god of isaac and
the god of jacob then mose trembl and durst not behold

7:33 then said the lord to him put off thi shoe from thi feet: for
the place where thou standest is holi ground

7:34 i have seen i have seen the afflict of my peopl which is in
egypt and i have heard their groan and am come down to deliv
them and now come i will send thee into egypt

7:35 thi mose whom they refus say who made thee a ruler and a
judge? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliver by the hand
of the angel which appear to him in the bush

7:36 he brought them out after that he had shew wonder and sign
in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilder forti
year

7:37 thi is that mose which said unto the children of israel a
prophet shall the lord your god rais up unto you of your brethren
like unto me; him shall ye hear

7:38 thi is he that wa in the church in the wilder with the
angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers: who
receiv the live oracl to give unto us: 7:39 to whom our father
would not obey but thrust him from them and in their heart turn
back again into egypt 7:40 say unto aaron make us god to go
befor us: for as for thi mose which brought us out of the land of
egypt we wot not what is becom of him

7:41 and they made a calf in those day and offer sacrific unto
the idol and rejoic in the work of their own hand

7:42 then god turn and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
as it is written in the book of the prophet o ye hous of israel
have ye offer to me slain beast and sacrific by the space of
forti year in the wilderness? 7:43 yea ye took up the tabernacl of
moloch and the star of your god remphan figur which ye made to
worship them: and i will carri you away beyond babylon

7:44 our father had the tabernacl of wit in the wilder as
he had appoint speak unto mose that he should make it
accord to the fashion that he had seen

7:45 which also our father that came after brought in with jesu into
the possess of the gentil whom god drave out befor the face of
our father unto the day of david; 7:46 who found favour befor god
and desir to find a tabernacl for the god of jacob

7:47 but solomon built him an hous

7:48 howbeit the most high dwelleth not in templ made with hands; as
saith the prophet 7:49 heaven is my throne and earth is my
footstool: what hous will ye build me? saith the lord: or what is the
place of my rest? 7:50 hath not my hand made all these things? 7:51
ye stiffneck and uncircumcis in heart and ear ye do alway
resist the holi ghost: as your father did so do ye

7:52 which of the prophet have not your father persecuted? and they
have slain them which shew befor of the come of the just one; of
whom ye have been now the betray and murderers: 7:53 who have
receiv the law by the disposit of angel and have not kept it

7:54 when they heard these thing they were cut to the heart and
they gnash on him with their teeth

7:55 but he be full of the holi ghost look up stedfastli into
heaven and saw the glori of god and jesu stand on the right hand
of god 7:56 and said behold i see the heaven open and the son
of man stand on the right hand of god

7:57 then they cri out with a loud voic and stop their ear
and ran upon him with one accord 7:58 and cast him out of the citi
and stone him: and the wit laid down their cloth at a young
man feet whose name wa saul

7:59 and they stone stephen call upon god and say lord
jesu receiv my spirit

7:60 and he kneel down and cri with a loud voic lord lay not
thi sin to their charg and when he had said thi he fell asleep

8:1 and saul wa consent unto hi death and at that time there wa
a great persecut against the church which wa at jerusalem; and
they were all scatter abroad throughout the region of judaea and
samaria except the apostl

8:2 and devout men carri stephen to hi burial and made great
lament over him

8:3 as for saul he made havock of the church enter into everi
hous and hale men and women commit them to prison

8:4 therefor they that were scatter abroad went everi where
preach the word

8:5 then philip went down to the citi of samaria and preach christ
unto them

8:6 and the peopl with one accord gave heed unto those thing which
philip spake hear and see the miracl which he did

8:7 for unclean spirit cri with loud voic came out of mani that
were possess with them: and mani taken with palsi and that were
lame were heal

8:8 and there wa great joy in that citi

8:9 but there wa a certain man call simon which beforetim in the
same citi use sorceri and bewitch the peopl of samaria give
out that himself wa some great one: 8:10 to whom they all gave heed
from the least to the greatest say thi man is the great power of
god

8:11 and to him they had regard becaus that of long time he had
bewitch them with sorceri

8:12 but when they believ philip preach the thing concern the
kingdom of god and the name of jesu christ they were baptiz both
men and women

8:13 then simon himself believ also: and when he wa baptiz he
continu with philip and wonder behold the miracl and sign
which were done

8:14 now when the apostl which were at jerusalem heard that samaria
had receiv the word of god they sent unto them peter and john: 8:15
who when they were come down pray for them that they might
receiv the holi ghost: 8:16 (for as yet he wa fallen upon none of
them: onli they were baptiz in the name of the lord jesus) 8:17
then laid they their hand on them and they receiv the holi ghost

8:18 and when simon saw that through lay on of the apostl hand
the holi ghost wa given he offer them money 8:19 say give me
also thi power that on whomsoev i lay hand he may receiv the
holi ghost

8:20 but peter said unto him thi money perish with thee becaus thou
hast thought that the gift of god may be purchas with money

8:21 thou hast neither part nor lot in thi matter: for thi heart is
not right in the sight of god

8:22 repent therefor of thi thi wicked and pray god if perhap
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee

8:23 for i perceiv that thou art in the gall of bitter and in
the bond of iniqu

8:24 then answer simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that
none of these thing which ye have spoken come upon me

8:25 and they when they had testifi and preach the word of the
lord return to jerusalem and preach the gospel in mani villag
of the samaritan

8:26 and the angel of the lord spake unto philip say aris and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto
gaza which is desert

8:27 and he aros and went: and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch
of great author under candac queen of the ethiopian who had the
charg of all her treasur and had come to jerusalem for to worship
8:28 wa return and sit in hi chariot read esaia the
prophet

8:29 then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to
thi chariot

8:30 and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet
esaia and said understandest thou what thou readest? 8:31 and he
said how can i except some man should guid me? and he desir
philip that he would come up and sit with him

8:32 the place of the scriptur which he read wa thi he wa led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb befor hi shearer so
open he not hi mouth: 8:33 in hi humili hi judgment wa
taken away: and who shall declar hi generation? for hi life is
taken from the earth

8:34 and the eunuch answer philip and said i pray thee of whom
speaketh the prophet this? of himself or of some other man? 8:35
then philip open hi mouth and began at the same scriptur and
preach unto him jesu

8:36 and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water:
and the eunuch said see here is water; what doth hinder me to be
baptized? 8:37 and philip said if thou believest with all thine
heart thou mayest

and he answer and said i believ that jesu christ is the son of
god

8:38 and he command the chariot to stand still: and they went down
both into the water both philip and the eunuch; and he baptiz him

8:39 and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the
lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went
on hi way rejoic

8:40 but philip wa found at azotus: and pass through he preach

9:1 and saul yet breath out threaten and slaughter against the
discipl of the lord went unto the high priest 9:2 and desir of

9:3 and as he journey he came near damascus: and suddenli there
shine round about him a light from heaven: 9:4 and he fell to the
earth and heard a voic say unto him saul saul whi persecutest
thou me? 9:5 and he said who art thou lord? and the lord said i am
jesu whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the
prick

9:6 and he trembl and astonish said lord what wilt thou have me
to do? and the lord said unto him aris and go into the citi and it
shall be told thee what thou must do

9:7 and the men which journey with him stood speechless hear a
voic but see no man

9:8 and saul aros from the earth; and when hi eye were open he
saw no man: but they led him by the hand and brought him into
damascu

9:9 and he wa three day without sight and neither did eat nor
drink

11:16 then rememb i the word of the lord how that he said john

and forthwith the angel depart from him

12:11 and when peter wa come to himself he said now i know of a

13:46 then paul and barnaba wax bold and said it wa necessari
that the word of god should first have been spoken to you: but see

lo we turn to the gentil

13:47 for so hath the lord command us say i have set thee to be

15:6 and the apostl and elder came togeth for to consid of thi
matter

15:7 and when there had been much disput peter rose up and said
unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god
made choic among us that the gentil by my mouth should hear the
word of the gospel and believ

15:8 and god which knoweth the heart bare them wit give them
the holi ghost even as he did unto us; 15:9 and put no differ
between us and them purifi their heart by faith

15:10 now therefor whi tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of
the discipl which neither our father nor we were abl to bear?
15:11 but we believ that through the grace of the lord jesu christ
we shall be save even as they

15:12 then all the multitud kept silenc and gave audienc to
barnaba and paul declar what miracl and wonder god had wrought
among the gentil by them

15:13 and after they had held their peac jame answer say men
and brethren hearken unto me: 15:14 simeon hath declar how god at
the first did visit the gentil to take out of them a peopl for hi
name

15:15 and to thi agre the word of the prophets; as it is written
15:16 after thi i will return and will build again the tabernacl of
david which is fallen down; and i will build again the ruin thereof
and i will set it up: 15:17 that the residu of men might seek after
the lord and all the gentil upon whom my name is call saith the
lord who doeth all these thing

15:18 known unto god are all hi work from the begin of the
world

15:19 wherefor my sentenc is that we troubl not them which from
among the gentil are turn to god: 15:20 but that we write unto
them that they abstain from pollut of idol and from
fornic and from thing strangl and from blood

15:21 for mose of old time hath in everi citi them that preach him
be read in the synagogu everi sabbath day

15:22 then pleas it the apostl and elder with the whole church
to send chosen men of their own compani to antioch with paul and
barnabas; name juda surnam barsaba and sila chief men among
the brethren: 15:23 and they wrote letter by them after thi manner;
the apostl and elder and brethren send greet unto the brethren
which are of the gentil in antioch and syria and cilicia

15:24 forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us
have troubl you with word subvert your soul say ye must
be circumcis and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
15:25 it seem good unto us be assembl with one accord to send
chosen men unto you with our belov barnaba and paul 15:26 men that
have hazard their live for the name of our lord jesu christ

15:27 we have sent therefor juda and sila who shall also tell you
the same thing by mouth

15:28 for it seem good to the holi ghost and to us to lay upon you
no greater burden than these necessari things; 15:29 that ye abstain
from meat offer to idol and from blood and from thing
strangl and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselv ye
shall do well fare ye well

15:30 so when they were dismiss they came to antioch: and when they
had gather the multitud togeth they deliv the epistle: 15:31
which when they had read they rejoic for the consol

15:32 and juda and sila be prophet also themselv exhort
the brethren with mani word and confirm them

15:33 and after they had tarri there a space they were let go in
peac from the brethren unto the apostl

15:34 notwithstand it pleas sila to abid there still

15:35 paul also and barnaba continu in antioch teach and
preach the word of the lord with mani other also

15:36 and some day after paul said unto barnaba let us go again and
visit our brethren in everi citi where we have preach the word of
the lord and see how they do

15:37 and barnaba determin to take with them john whose surnam
wa mark

15:38 but paul thought not good to take him with them who depart
from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work

15:39 and the content wa so sharp between them that they depart
asund one from the other: and so barnaba took mark and sail unto
cyprus; 15:40 and paul chose sila and depart be recommend by
the brethren unto the grace of god

15:41 and he went through syria and cilicia confirm the church

16:1 then came he to derb and lystra: and behold a certain discipl
wa there name timotheu the son of a certain woman which wa a
jewess and believed; but hi father wa a greek: 16:2 which wa well
report of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium

16:3 him would paul have to go forth with him; and took and
circumcis him becaus of the jew which were in those quarters: for
they knew all that hi father wa a greek

16:4 and as they went through the citi they deliv them the
decre for to keep that were ordain of the apostl and elder
which were at jerusalem

16:5 and so were the church establish in the faith and increas
in number daili

16:6 now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of
galatia and were forbidden of the holi ghost to preach the word in
asia 16:7 after they were come to mysia they assay to go into
bithynia: but the spirit suffer them not

16:8 and they pass by mysia came down to troa

16:9 and a vision appear to paul in the night; there stood a man of
macedonia and pray him say come over into macedonia and help
us

16:10 and after he had seen the vision immedi we endeavour to
go into macedonia assuredli gather that the lord had call us for
to preach the gospel unto them

16:11 therefor loos from troa we came with a straight cours to
samothracia and the next day to neapolis; 16:12 and from thenc to
philippi which is the chief citi of that part of macedonia and a
colony: and we were in that citi abid certain day

16:13 and on the sabbath we went out of the citi by a river side
where prayer wa wont to be made; and we sat down and spake unto the
women which resort thither

16:14 and a certain woman name lydia a seller of purpl of the citi
of thyatira which worship god heard us: whose heart the lord
open that she attend unto the thing which were spoken of paul

16:15 and when she wa baptiz and her household she besought us
say if ye have judg me to be faith to the lord come into my
hous and abid there and she constrain us

16:16 and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel
possess with a spirit of divin met us which brought her
master much gain by soothsaying: 16:17 the same follow paul and us
and cri say these men are the servant of the most high god
which shew unto us the way of salvat

16:18 and thi did she mani day but paul be griev turn and
said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesu christ to come
out of her

and he came out the same hour

16:19 and when her master saw that the hope of their gain wa gone
they caught paul and sila and drew them into the marketplac unto
the ruler 16:20 and brought them to the magistr say these
men be jew do exceedingli troubl our citi 16:21 and teach
custom which are not law for us to receiv neither to observ
be roman

16:22 and the multitud rose up togeth against them: and the
magistr rent off their cloth and command to beat them

16:23 and when they had laid mani stripe upon them they cast them
into prison charg the jailor to keep them safely: 16:24 who
have receiv such a charg thrust them into the inner prison and
made their feet fast in the stock

16:25 and at midnight paul and sila pray and sang prais unto
god: and the prison heard them

16:26 and suddenli there wa a great earthquak so that the
foundat of the prison were shaken: and immedi all the door
were open and everi one band were loos

16:27 and the keeper of the prison awak out of hi sleep and
see the prison door open he drew out hi sword and would have
kill himself suppos that the prison had been fled

16:28 but paul cri with a loud voic say do thyself no harm:
for we are all here

16:29 then he call for a light and sprang in and came trembl
and fell down befor paul and sila 16:30 and brought them out and
said sir what must i do to be saved? 16:31 and they said believ
on the lord jesu christ and thou shalt be save and thi hous

16:32 and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that
were in hi hous

16:33 and he took them the same hour of the night and wash their
stripes; and wa baptiz he and all hi straightway

16:34 and when he had brought them into hi hous he set meat befor
them and rejoic believ in god with all hi hous

16:35 and when it wa day the magistr sent the serjeant say
let those men go

16:36 and the keeper of the prison told thi say to paul the
magistr have sent to let you go: now therefor depart and go in
peac

16:37 but paul said unto them they have beaten us openli uncondemn
be roman and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselv and fetch us
out

16:38 and the serjeant told these word unto the magistrates: and
they fear when they heard that they were roman

16:39 and they came and besought them and brought them out and
desir them to depart out of the citi

16:40 and they went out of the prison and enter into the hous of
lydia: and when they had seen the brethren they comfort them and
depart

17:1 now when they had pass through amphipoli and apollonia they
came to thessalonica where wa a synagogu of the jews: 17:2 and
paul as hi manner wa went in unto them and three sabbath day
reason with them out of the scriptur 17:3 open and alleg
that christ must need have suffer and risen again from the dead;
and that thi jesu whom i preach unto you is christ

17:4 and some of them believ and consort with paul and silas; and
of the devout greek a great multitud and of the chief women not a
few

17:5 but the jew which believ not move with envi took unto them
certain lewd fellow of the baser sort and gather a compani and
set all the citi on an uproar and assault the hous of jason and
sought to bring them out to the peopl

17:6 and when they found them not they drew jason and certain
brethren unto the ruler of the citi cri these that have turn
the world upsid down are come hither also; 17:7 whom jason hath
received: and these all do contrari to the decre of caesar say
that there is anoth king one jesu

17:8 and they troubl the peopl and the ruler of the citi when
they heard these thing

17:9 and when they had taken secur of jason and of the other they
let them go

17:10 and the brethren immedi sent away paul and sila by night
unto berea: who come thither went into the synagogu of the jew

17:11 these were more nobl than those in thessalonica in that they
receiv the word with all readi of mind and search the
scriptur daili whether those thing were so

17:12 therefor mani of them believed; also of honour women which
were greek and of men not a few

17:13 but when the jew of thessalonica had knowledg that the word of
god wa preach of paul at berea they came thither also and stir
up the peopl

17:14 and then immedi the brethren sent away paul to go as it
were to the sea: but sila and timotheu abod there still

17:15 and they that conduct paul brought him unto athens: and
receiv a command unto sila and timotheu for to come to him
with all speed they depart

17:16 now while paul wait for them at athen hi spirit wa stir
in him when he saw the citi wholli given to idolatri

17:17 therefor disput he in the synagogu with the jew and with
the devout person and in the market daili with them that met with
him

17:18 then certain philosoph of the epicurean and of the stoick
encount him and some said what will thi babbler say? other
some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strang gods: becaus he
preach unto them jesu and the resurrect

17:19 and they took him and brought him unto areopagu say may
we know what thi new doctrin whereof thou speakest is? 17:20 for
thou bringest certain strang thing to our ears: we would know
therefor what these thing mean

17:21 (for all the athenian and stranger which were there spent
their time in noth els but either to tell or to hear some new
thing) 17:22 then paul stood in the midst of mar hill and said
ye men of athen i perceiv that in all thing ye are too
superstiti

17:23 for as i pass by and beheld your devot i found an altar
with thi inscript to the unknown god whom therefor ye
ignorantli worship him declar i unto you

17:24 god that made the world and all thing therein see that he
is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in templ made with hands;
17:25 neither is worship with men hand as though he need ani
thing see he giveth to all life and breath and all things; 17:26
and hath made of one blood all nation of men for to dwell on all the
face of the earth and hath determin the time befor appoint and
the bound of their habitation; 17:27 that they should seek the lord
if hapli they might feel after him and find him though he be not far
from everi one of us: 17:28 for in him we live and move and have our
being; as certain also of your own poet have said for we are also
hi offspr

17:29 forasmuch then as we are the offspr of god we ought not to
think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven
by art and man devic

17:30 and the time of thi ignor god wink at; but now
commandeth all men everi where to repent: 17:31 becaus he hath
appoint a day in the which he will judg the world in righteous
by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assur
unto all men in that he hath rais him from the dead

17:32 and when they heard of the resurrect of the dead some
mocked: and other said we will hear thee again of thi matter

17:33 so paul depart from among them

17:34 howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed: among the
which wa dionysiu the areopagit and a woman name damari and
other with them

18:1 after these thing paul depart from athen and came to
corinth; 18:2 and found a certain jew name aquila born in pontu
late come from itali with hi wife priscilla; (becaus that
claudiu had command all jew to depart from rome:) and came unto
them

18:3 and becaus he wa of the same craft he abod with them and
wrought: for by their occup they were tentmak

18:4 and he reason in the synagogu everi sabbath and persuad the
jew and the greek

18:5 and when sila and timotheu were come from macedonia paul wa
press in the spirit and testifi to the jew that jesu wa
christ

18:6 and when they oppos themselv and blasphem he shook hi
raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads; i am
clean; from henceforth i will go unto the gentil

18:7 and he depart thenc and enter into a certain man hous
name justu one that worship god whose hous join hard to the
synagogu

18:8 and crispu the chief ruler of the synagogu believ on the
lord with all hi house; and mani of the corinthian hear believ
and were baptiz

18:9 then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not
afraid but speak and hold not thi peace: 18:10 for i am with thee
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for i have much peopl in
thi citi

18:11 and he continu there a year and six month teach the word
of god among them

18:12 and when gallio wa the deputi of achaia the jew made
insurrect with one accord against paul and brought him to the
judgment seat 18:13 say thi fellow persuadeth men to worship god
contrari to the law

18:14 and when paul wa now about to open hi mouth gallio said unto
the jew if it were a matter of wrong or wick lewd o ye jew
reason would that i should bear with you: 18:15 but if it be a
question of word and name and of your law look ye to it; for i
will be no judg of such matter

18:16 and he drave them from the judgment seat

18:17 then all the greek took sosthen the chief ruler of the
synagogu and beat him befor the judgment seat and gallio care for
none of those thing

18:18 and paul after thi tarri there yet a good while and then
took hi leav of the brethren and sail thenc into syria and with
him priscilla and aquila; have shorn hi head in cenchrea: for he
had a vow

18:19 and he came to ephesu and left them there: but he himself
enter into the synagogu and reason with the jew

18:20 when they desir him to tarri longer time with them he
consent not; 18:21 but bade them farewel say i must by all
mean keep thi feast that cometh in jerusalem: but i will return
again unto you if god will and he sail from ephesu

18:22 and when he had land at caesarea and gone up and salut the
church he went down to antioch

18:23 and after he had spent some time there he depart and went
over all the countri of galatia and phrygia in order strengthen
all the discipl

18:24 and a certain jew name apollo born at alexandria an eloqu
man and mighti in the scriptur came to ephesu

18:25 thi man wa instruct in the way of the lord; and be
fervent in the spirit he spake and taught dilig the thing of
the lord know onli the baptism of john

18:26 and he began to speak boldli in the synagogue: whom when aquila
and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expound unto
him the way of god more perfectli

18:27 and when he wa dispos to pass into achaia the brethren
wrote exhort the discipl to receiv him: who when he wa come
help them much which had believ through grace: 18:28 for he
mightili convinc the jew and that publickli shew by the
scriptur that jesu wa christ

19:1 and it came to pass that while apollo wa at corinth paul
have pass through the upper coast came to ephesus: and find
certain discipl 19:2 he said unto them have ye receiv the holi
ghost sinc ye believed? and they said unto him we have not so much
as heard whether there be ani holi ghost

19:3 and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized? and they
said unto john baptism

19:4 then said paul john verili baptiz with the baptism of
repent say unto the peopl that they should believ on him
which should come after him that is on christ jesu

19:5 when they heard thi they were baptiz in the name of the lord
jesu

19:6 and when paul had laid hi hand upon them the holi ghost came
on them; and they spake with tongu and prophesi

19:7 and all the men were about twelv

19:8 and he went into the synagogu and spake boldli for the space of
three month disput and persuad the thing concern the
kingdom of god

19:9 but when diver were harden and believ not but spake evil
of that way befor the multitud he depart from them and separ
the discipl disput daili in the school of one tyrannu

19:10 and thi continu by the space of two years; so that all they
which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesu both jew and
greek

19:11 and god wrought special miracl by the hand of paul: 19:12 so
that from hi bodi were brought unto the sick handkerchief or apron
and the diseas depart from them and the evil spirit went out of
them

19:13 then certain of the vagabond jew exorcist took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirit the name of the lord jesu
say we adjur you by jesu whom paul preacheth

19:14 and there were seven son of one sceva a jew and chief of the
priest which did so

19:15 and the evil spirit answer and said jesu i know and paul i
know; but who are ye? 19:16 and the man in whom the evil spirit wa
leap on them and overcam them and prevail against them so that
they fled out of that hous nake and wound

19:17 and thi wa known to all the jew and greek also dwell at
ephesus; and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesu wa
magnifi

19:18 and mani that believ came and confess and shew their
deed

19:19 mani of them also which use curiou art brought their book
togeth and burn them befor all men: and they count the price
of them and found it fifti thousand piec of silver

19:20 so mightili grew the word of god and prevail

19:21 after these thing were end paul purpos in the spirit when
he had pass through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem
say after i have been there i must also see rome

19:22 so he sent into macedonia two of them that minist unto him
timotheu and erastus; but he himself stay in asia for a season

19:23 and the same time there aros no small stir about that way

19:24 for a certain man name demetriu a silversmith which made
silver shrine for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
19:25 whom he call togeth with the workmen of like occup and
said sir ye know that by thi craft we have our wealth

19:26 moreov ye see and hear that not alon at ephesu but almost
throughout all asia thi paul hath persuad and turn away much
peopl say that they be no god which are made with hands: 19:27
so that not onli thi our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but
also that the templ of the great goddess diana should be despis
and her magnific should be destroy whom all asia and the world
worshippeth

19:28 and when they heard these say they were full of wrath and
cri out say great is diana of the ephesian

19:29 and the whole citi wa fill with confusion: and have caught
gaiu and aristarchu men of macedonia paul companion in travel
they rush with one accord into the theatr

19:30 and when paul would have enter in unto the peopl the
discipl suffer him not

19:31 and certain of the chief of asia which were hi friend sent
unto him desir him that he would not adventur himself into the
theatr

19:32 some therefor cri one thing and some another: for the
assembl wa confused: and the more part knew not wherefor they were
come togeth

19:33 and they drew alexand out of the multitud the jew put
him forward and alexand beckon with the hand and would have made
hi defenc unto the peopl

19:34 but when they knew that he wa a jew all with one voic about
the space of two hour cri out great is diana of the ephesian

19:35 and when the townclerk had appeas the peopl he said ye men
of ephesu what man is there that knoweth not how that the citi of
the ephesian is a worshipp of the great goddess diana and of the
imag which fell down from jupiter? 19:36 see then that these
thing cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do
noth rashli

19:37 for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robber
of church nor yet blasphem of your goddess

19:38 wherefor if demetriu and the craftsmen which are with him
have a matter against ani man the law is open and there are
deputies: let them implead one anoth

19:39 but if ye enquir ani thing concern other matter it shall
be determin in a law assembl

19:40 for we are in danger to be call in question for thi day
uproar there be no caus wherebi we may give an account of thi
concours

19:41 and when he had thu spoken he dismiss the assembl

20:1 and after the uproar wa ceas paul call unto him the
discipl and embrac them and depart for to go into macedonia

20:2 and when he had gone over those part and had given them much
exhort he came into greec 20:3 and there abod three month
and when the jew laid wait for him as he wa about to sail into
syria he purpos to return through macedonia

20:4 and there accompani him into asia sopat of berea; and of the
thessalonian aristarchu and secundus; and gaiu of derb and
timotheus; and of asia tychicu and trophimu

20:5 these go befor tarri for us at troa

20:6 and we sail away from philippi after the day of unleaven
bread and came unto them to troa in five days; where we abod seven
day

20:7 and upon the first day of the week when the discipl came
togeth to break bread paul preach unto them readi to depart on
the morrow; and continu hi speech until midnight

20:8 and there were mani light in the upper chamber where they were
gather togeth

20:9 and there sat in a window a certain young man name eutychu
be fallen into a deep sleep: and as paul wa long preach he
sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and wa taken
up dead

20:10 and paul went down and fell on him and embrac him said
troubl not yourselves; for hi life is in him

20:11 when he therefor wa come up again and had broken bread and
eaten and talk a long while even till break of day so he
depart

20:12 and they brought the young man aliv and were not a littl
comfort

20:13 and we went befor to ship and sail unto asso there
intend to take in paul: for so had he appoint mind himself to
go afoot

20:14 and when he met with us at asso we took him in and came to
mitylen

20:15 and we sail thenc and came the next day over against chios;
and the next day we arriv at samo and tarri at trogyllium; and
the next day we came to miletu

20:16 for paul had determin to sail by ephesu becaus he would not
spend the time in asia: for he hast if it were possibl for him to
be at jerusalem the day of pentecost

20:17 and from miletu he sent to ephesu and call the elder of
the church

20:18 and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from
the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been
with you at all season 20:19 serv the lord with all humil of
mind and with mani tear and temptat which befel me by the
lie in wait of the jews: 20:20 and how i kept back noth that wa
profit unto you but have shew you and have taught you
publickli and from hous to hous 20:21 testifi both to the jew
and also to the greek repent toward god and faith toward our
lord jesu christ

20:22 and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not
know the thing that shall befal me there: 20:23 save that the
holi ghost witnesseth in everi citi say that bond and afflict
abid me

20:24 but none of these thing move me neither count i my life dear
unto myself so that i might finish my cours with joy and the
ministri which i have receiv of the lord jesu to testifi the
gospel of the grace of god

20:25 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone
preach the kingdom of god shall see my face no more

20:26 wherefor i take you to record thi day that i am pure from the
blood of all men

20:27 for i have not shun to declar unto you all the counsel of
god

20:28 take heed therefor unto yourselv and to all the flock over
the which the holi ghost hath made you overs to feed the church
of god which he hath purchas with hi own blood

20:29 for i know thi that after my depart shall grievou wolv
enter in among you not spare the flock

20:30 also of your own selv shall men aris speak pervers
thing to draw away discipl after them

20:31 therefor watch and rememb that by the space of three year
i ceas not to warn everi one night and day with tear

20:32 and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of hi
grace which is abl to build you up and to give you an inherit
among all them which are sanctifi

20:33 i have covet no man silver or gold or apparel

20:34 yea ye yourselv know that these hand have minist unto
my necess and to them that were with me

20:35 i have shew you all thing how that so labour ye ought to
support the weak and to rememb the word of the lord jesu how he
said it is more bless to give than to receiv

20:36 and when he had thu spoken he kneel down and pray with
them all

20:37 and they all wept sore and fell on paul neck and kiss him
20:38 sorrow most of all for the word which he spake that they
should see hi face no more and they accompani him unto the ship

21:1 and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had
launch we came with a straight cours unto coo and the day
follow unto rhode and from thenc unto patara: 21:2 and find a
ship sail over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth

21:3 now when we had discov cypru we left it on the left hand
and sail into syria and land at tyre: for there the ship wa to
unlad her burden

21:4 and find discipl we tarri there seven days: who said to
paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem

21:5 and when we had accomplish those day we depart and went our
way; and they all brought us on our way with wive and children till
we were out of the city: and we kneel down on the shore and pray

21:6 and when we had taken our leav one of anoth we took ship; and
they return home again

21:7 and when we had finish our cours from tyre we came to
ptolemai and salut the brethren and abod with them one day

21:8 and the next day we that were of paul compani depart and
came unto caesarea: and we enter into the hous of philip the
evangelist which wa one of the seven; and abod with him

21:9 and the same man had four daughter virgin which did prophesi

21:10 and as we tarri there mani day there came down from judaea a
certain prophet name agabu

21:11 and when he wa come unto us he took paul girdl and bound
hi own hand and feet and said thu saith the holi ghost so shall
the jew at jerusalem bind the man that owneth thi girdl and shall
deliv him into the hand of the gentil

21:12 and when we heard these thing both we and they of that place
besought him not to go up to jerusalem

21:13 then paul answer what mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart? for i am readi not to be bound onli but also to die at
jerusalem for the name of the lord jesu

21:14 and when he would not be persuad we ceas say the will
of the lord be done

21:15 and after those day we took up our carriag and went up to
jerusalem

21:16 there went with us also certain of the discipl of caesarea
and brought with them one mnason of cypru an old discipl with whom
we should lodg

21:17 and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren receiv us
gladli

21:18 and the day follow paul went in with us unto james; and all
the elder were present

21:19 and when he had salut them he declar particularli what
thing god had wrought among the gentil by hi ministri

21:20 and when they heard it they glorifi the lord and said unto
him thou seest brother how mani thousand of jew there are which
believe; and they are all zealou of the law: 21:21 and they are
inform of thee that thou teachest all the jew which are among the
gentil to forsak mose say that they ought not to circumcis
their children neither to walk after the custom

21:22 what is it therefore? the multitud must need come together:
for they will hear that thou art come

21:23 do therefor thi that we say to thee: we have four men which
have a vow on them; 21:24 them take and purifi thyself with them and
be at charg with them that they may shave their heads: and all may
know that those thing whereof they were inform concern thee
are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderli and keepest
the law

21:25 as touch the gentil which believ we have written and
conclud that they observ no such thing save onli that they keep
themselv from thing offer to idol and from blood and from
strangl and from fornic

21:26 then paul took the men and the next day purifi himself with
them enter into the templ to signifi the accomplish of the
day of purif until that an offer should be offer for
everi one of them

21:27 and when the seven day were almost end the jew which were
of asia when they saw him in the templ stir up all the peopl
and laid hand on him 21:28 cri out men of israel help: thi is
the man that teacheth all men everi where against the peopl and the
law and thi place: and further brought greek also into the templ
and hath pollut thi holi place

21:29 (for they had seen befor with him in the citi trophimu an
ephesian whom they suppos that paul had brought into the temple)
21:30 and all the citi wa move and the peopl ran together: and
they took paul and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the
door were shut

21:31 and as they went about to kill him tide came unto the chief
captain of the band that all jerusalem wa in an uproar

21:32 who immedi took soldier and centurion and ran down unto
them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldier they left
beat of paul

21:33 then the chief captain came near and took him and command
him to be bound with two chains; and demand who he wa and what he
had done

21:34 and some cri one thing some anoth among the multitude: and
when he could not know the certainti for the tumult he command him
to be carri into the castl

21:35 and when he came upon the stair so it wa that he wa born
of the soldier for the violenc of the peopl

21:36 for the multitud of the peopl follow after cri away
with him

21:37 and as paul wa to be led into the castl he said unto the
chief captain may i speak unto thee? who said canst thou speak
greek? 21:38 art not thou that egyptian which befor these day
madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilder four thousand
men that were murderers? 21:39 but paul said i am a man which am a
jew of tarsu a citi in cilicia a citizen of no mean city: and i
beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the peopl

21:40 and when he had given him licenc paul stood on the stair and
beckon with the hand unto the peopl and when there wa made a
great silenc he spake unto them in the hebrew tongu say 22:1
men brethren and father hear ye my defenc which i make now unto
you

22:2 (and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongu to them
they kept the more silence: and he saith) 22:3 i am verili a man
which am a jew born in tarsu a citi in cilicia yet brought up in
thi citi at the feet of gamaliel and taught accord to the perfect
manner of the law of the father and wa zealou toward god as ye
all are thi day

22:4 and i persecut thi way unto the death bind and deliv
into prison both men and women

22:5 as also the high priest doth bear me wit and all the estat
of the elders: from whom also i receiv letter unto the brethren
and went to damascu to bring them which were there bound unto
jerusalem for to be punish

22:6 and it came to pass that as i made my journey and wa come
nigh unto damascu about noon suddenli there shone from heaven a
great light round about me

22:7 and i fell unto the ground and heard a voic say unto me
saul saul whi persecutest thou me? 22:8 and i answer who art
thou lord? and he said unto me i am jesu of nazareth whom thou
persecutest

22:9 and they that were with me saw inde the light and were afraid;
but they heard not the voic of him that spake to me

22:10 and i said what shall i do lord? and the lord said unto me
aris and go into damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all
thing which are appoint for thee to do

22:11 and when i could not see for the glori of that light be led
by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascu

22:12 and one anania a devout man accord to the law have a
good report of all the jew which dwelt there 22:13 came unto me and
stood and said unto me brother saul receiv thi sight and the same
hour i look up upon him

22:14 and he said the god of our father hath chosen thee that thou
shouldest know hi will and see that just one and shouldest hear the
voic of hi mouth

22:15 for thou shalt be hi wit unto all men of what thou hast
seen and heard

22:16 and now whi tarriest thou? aris and be baptiz and wash away
thi sin call on the name of the lord

22:17 and it came to pass that when i wa come again to jerusalem
even while i pray in the templ i wa in a trance; 22:18 and saw
him say unto me make hast and get thee quickli out of jerusalem:
for they will not receiv thi testimoni concern me

22:19 and i said lord they know that i imprison and beat in everi
synagogu them that believ on thee: 22:20 and when the blood of thi
martyr stephen wa shed i also wa stand by and consent unto
hi death and kept the raiment of them that slew him

22:21 and he said unto me depart: for i will send thee far henc unto
the gentil

22:22 and they gave him audienc unto thi word and then lift up
their voic and said away with such a fellow from the earth: for it
is not fit that he should live

22:23 and as they cri out and cast off their cloth and threw
dust into the air 22:24 the chief captain command him to be brought
into the castl and bade that he should be examin by scourging;
that he might know wherefor they cri so against him

22:25 and as they bound him with thong paul said unto the centurion
that stood by is it law for you to scourg a man that is a roman
and uncondemned? 22:26 when the centurion heard that he went and
told the chief captain say take heed what thou doest: for thi
man is a roman

22:27 then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art
thou a roman? he said yea

22:28 and the chief captain answer with a great sum obtain i thi
freedom and paul said but i wa free born

22:29 then straightway they depart from him which should have
examin him: and the chief captain also wa afraid after he knew
that he wa a roman and becaus he had bound him

22:30 on the morrow becaus he would have known the certainti
wherefor he wa accus of the jew he loos him from hi band
and command the chief priest and all their council to appear and
brought paul down and set him befor them

23:1 and paul earnestli behold the council said men and
brethren i have live in all good conscienc befor god until thi
day

23:2 and the high priest anania command them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth

23:3 then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou white wall:
for sittest thou to judg me after the law and commandest me to be
smitten contrari to the law? 23:4 and they that stood by said
revilest thou god high priest? 23:5 then said paul i wist not
brethren that he wa the high priest: for it is written thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thi peopl

23:6 but when paul perceiv that the one part were sadduce and the
other pharise he cri out in the council men and brethren i am a
pharise the son of a pharisee: of the hope and resurrect of the
dead i am call in question

23:7 and when he had so said there aros a dissens between the
pharise and the sadducees: and the multitud wa divid

23:8 for the sadduce say that there is no resurrect neither
angel nor spirit: but the pharise confess both

23:9 and there aros a great cry: and the scribe that were of the
pharise part aros and strove say we find no evil in thi
man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight
against god

23:10 and when there aros a great dissens the chief captain
fear lest paul should have been pull in piec of them command
the soldier to go down and to take him by forc from among them and
to bring him into the castl

23:11 and the night follow the lord stood by him and said be of
good cheer paul: for as thou hast testifi of me in jerusalem so
must thou bear wit also at rome

23:12 and when it wa day certain of the jew band togeth and
bound themselv under a curs say that they would neither eat nor
drink till they had kill paul

23:13 and they were more than forti which had made thi conspiraci

23:14 and they came to the chief priest and elder and said we have
bound ourselv under a great curs that we will eat noth until we
have slain paul

23:15 now therefor ye with the council signifi to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquir
someth more perfectli concern him: and we or ever he come near
are readi to kill him

23:16 and when paul sister son heard of their lie in wait he
went and enter into the castl and told paul

23:17 then paul call one of the centurion unto him and said bring
thi young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to
tell him

23:18 so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said
paul the prison call me unto him and pray me to bring thi
young man unto thee who hath someth to say unto thee

23:19 then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him
asid privat and ask him what is that thou hast to tell me?
23:20 and he said the jew have agre to desir thee that thou
wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they
would enquir somewhat of him more perfectli

23:21 but do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
of them more than forti men which have bound themselv with an oath
that they will neither eat nor drink till they have kill him: and
now are they readi look for a promis from thee

23:22 so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charg
him see thou tell no man that thou hast shew these thing to me

23:23 and he call unto him two centurion say make readi two
hundr soldier to go to caesarea and horsemen threescor and ten
and spearmen two hundr at the third hour of the night; 23:24 and
provid them beast that they may set paul on and bring him safe
unto felix the governor

23:25 and he wrote a letter after thi manner: 23:26 claudiu lysia
unto the most excel governor felix sendeth greet

23:27 thi man wa taken of the jew and should have been kill of
them: then came i with an armi and rescu him have understood
that he wa a roman

23:28 and when i would have known the caus wherefor they accus
him i brought him forth into their council: 23:29 whom i perceiv to
be accus of question of their law but to have noth laid to hi
charg worthi of death or of bond

23:30 and when it wa told me how that the jew laid wait for the man
i sent straightway to thee and gave command to hi accus also
to say befor thee what they had against him farewel

23:31 then the soldier as it wa command them took paul and
brought him by night to antipatri

23:32 on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and
return to the castle: 23:33 who when they came to caesarea and
deliv the epistl to the governor present paul also befor him

23:34 and when the governor had read the letter he ask of what
provinc he wa and when he understood that he wa of cilicia; 23:35
i will hear thee said he when thine accus are also come and he
command him to be kept in herod judgment hall

24:1 and after five day anania the high priest descend with the
elder and with a certain orat name tertullu who inform the
governor against paul

24:2 and when he wa call forth tertullu began to accus him
say see that by thee we enjoy great quiet and that veri
worthi deed are done unto thi nation by thi provid 24:3 we
accept it alway and in all place most nobl felix with all
thank

24:4 notwithstand that i be not further tediou unto thee i pray
thee that thou wouldest hear us of thi clemenc a few word

24:5 for we have found thi man a pestil fellow and a mover of
sedit among all the jew throughout the world and a ringlead of
the sect of the nazarenes: 24:6 who also hath gone about to profan
the temple: whom we took and would have judg accord to our law

24:7 but the chief captain lysia came upon us and with great
violenc took him away out of our hand 24:8 command hi accus
to come unto thee: by examin of whom thyself mayest take knowledg
of all these thing whereof we accus him

24:9 and the jew also assent say that these thing were so

24:10 then paul after that the governor had beckon unto him to
speak answer forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of mani year
a judg unto thi nation i do the more cheer answer for myself:
24:11 becaus that thou mayest understand that there are yet but
twelv day sinc i went up to jerusalem for to worship

24:12 and they neither found me in the templ disput with ani man
neither rais up the peopl neither in the synagogu nor in the
city: 24:13 neither can they prove the thing whereof they now accus
me

24:14 but thi i confess unto thee that after the way which they call
heresi so worship i the god of my father believ all thing which
are written in the law and in the prophets: 24:15 and have hope toward
god which they themselv also allow that there shall be a
resurrect of the dead both of the just and unjust

24:16 and herein do i exercis myself to have alway a conscienc
void to offenc toward god and toward men

24:17 now after mani year i came to bring alm to my nation and
offer

24:18 whereupon certain jew from asia found me purifi in the
templ neither with multitud nor with tumult

24:19 who ought to have been here befor thee and object if they had
ought against me

24:20 or els let these same here say if they have found ani evil
do in me while i stood befor the council 24:21 except it be for
thi one voic that i cri stand among them touch the
resurrect of the dead i am call in question by you thi day

24:22 and when felix heard these thing have more perfect knowledg
of that way he defer them and said when lysia the chief captain
shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter

24:23 and he command a centurion to keep paul and to let him have
liberti and that he should forbid none of hi acquaint to
minist or come unto him

24:24 and after certain day when felix came with hi wife drusilla
which wa a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concern the
faith in christ

24:25 and as he reason of righteous temper and judgment to
come felix trembl and answer go thi way for thi time; when i
have a conveni season i will call for thee

24:26 he hope also that money should have been given him of paul
that he might loos him: wherefor he sent for him the often and
commun with him

24:27 but after two year porciu festu came into felix room: and
felix will to shew the jew a pleasur left paul bound

25:1 now when festu wa come into the provinc after three day he
ascend from caesarea to jerusalem

25:2 then the high priest and the chief of the jew inform him
against paul and besought him 25:3 and desir favour against him
that he would send for him to jerusalem lay wait in the way to
kill him

25:4 but festu answer that paul should be kept at caesarea and
that he himself would depart shortli thither

25:5 let them therefor said he which among you are abl go down
with me and accus thi man if there be ani wicked in him

25:6 and when he had tarri among them more than ten day he went
down unto caesarea; and the next day sit on the judgment seat
command paul to be brought

25:7 and when he wa come the jew which came down from jerusalem
stood round about and laid mani and grievou complaint against paul
which they could not prove

25:8 while he answer for himself neither against the law of the
jew neither against the templ nor yet against caesar have i
offend ani thing at all

25:9 but festu will to do the jew a pleasur answer paul and
said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judg of these
thing befor me? 25:10 then said paul i stand at caesar judgment
seat where i ought to be judged: to the jew have i done no wrong as
thou veri well knowest

25:11 for if i be an offend or have commit ani thing worthi of
death i refus not to die: but if there be none of these thing
whereof these accus me no man may deliv me unto them i appeal
unto caesar

25:12 then festu when he had confer with the council answer
hast thou appeal unto caesar? unto caesar shalt thou go

25:13 and after certain day king agrippa and bernic came unto
caesarea to salut festu

25:14 and when they had been there mani day festu declar paul
caus unto the king say there is a certain man left in bond by
felix: 25:15 about whom when i wa at jerusalem the chief priest
and the elder of the jew inform me desir to have judgment
against him

25:16 to whom i answer it is not the manner of the roman to
deliv ani man to die befor that he which is accus have the
accus face to face and have licenc to answer for himself
concern the crime laid against him

25:17 therefor when they were come hither without ani delay on the
morrow i sat on the judgment seat and command the man to be brought
forth

25:18 against whom when the accus stood up they brought none
accus of such thing as i supposed: 25:19 but had certain
question against him of their own superstit and of one jesu
which wa dead whom paul affirm to be aliv

25:20 and becaus i doubt of such manner of question i ask him
whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judg of these
matter

25:21 but when paul had appeal to be reserv unto the hear of
augustu i command him to be kept till i might send him to caesar

25:22 then agrippa said unto festu i would also hear the man myself
to morrow said he thou shalt hear him

25:23 and on the morrow when agrippa wa come and bernic with
great pomp and wa enter into the place of hear with the chief
captain and princip men of the citi at festu command paul
wa brought forth

25:24 and festu said king agrippa and all men which are here
present with us ye see thi man about whom all the multitud of the
jew have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here cri that
he ought not to live ani longer

25:25 but when i found that he had commit noth worthi of death
and that he himself hath appeal to augustu i have determin to
send him

25:26 of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefor
i have brought him forth befor you and special befor thee o king
agrippa that after examin had i might have somewhat to write

25:27 for it seemeth to me unreason to send a prison and not
withal to signifi the crime laid against him

26:1 then agrippa said unto paul thou art permit to speak for
thyself

then paul stretch forth the hand and answer for himself: 26:2 i
think myself happi king agrippa becaus i shall answer for myself
thi day befor thee touch all the thing whereof i am accus of
the jews: 26:3 especi becaus i know thee to be expert in all
custom and question which are among the jews: wherefor i beseech
thee to hear me patient

26:4 my manner of life from my youth which wa at the first among
mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews; 26:5 which knew me
from the begin if they would testifi that after the most
straitest sect of our religion i live a pharise

26:6 and now i stand and am judg for the hope of the promis made of
god unto our fathers: 26:7 unto which promis our twelv tribe
instantli serv god day and night hope to come for which hope
sake king agrippa i am accus of the jew

26:8 whi should it be thought a thing incred with you that god
should rais the dead? 26:9 i verili thought with myself that i
ought to do mani thing contrari to the name of jesu of nazareth

26:10 which thing i also did in jerusalem: and mani of the saint did
i shut up in prison have receiv author from the chief priests;
and when they were put to death i gave my voic against them

26:11 and i punish them oft in everi synagogu and compel them
to blaspheme; and be exceedingli mad against them i persecut
them even unto strang citi

26:12 whereupon as i went to damascu with author and commiss
from the chief priest 26:13 at midday o king i saw in the way a
light from heaven abov the bright of the sun shine round
about me and them which journey with me

26:14 and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voic
speak unto me and say in the hebrew tongu saul saul whi
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the prick

26:15 and i said who art thou lord? and he said i am jesu whom
thou persecutest

26:16 but rise and stand upon thi feet: for i have appear unto thee
for thi purpos to make thee a minist and a wit both of these
thing which thou hast seen and of those thing in the which i will
appear unto thee; 26:17 deliv thee from the peopl and from the
gentil unto whom now i send thee 26:18 to open their eye and to
turn them from dark to light and from the power of satan unto
god that they may receiv forgiv of sin and inherit among
them which are sanctifi by faith that is in me

26:19 whereupon o king agrippa i wa not disobedi unto the
heavenli vision: 26:20 but shew first unto them of damascu and at
jerusalem and throughout all the coast of judaea and then to the
gentil that they should repent and turn to god and do work meet
for repent

26:21 for these caus the jew caught me in the templ and went
about to kill me

26:22 have therefor obtain help of god i continu unto thi day
wit both to small and great say none other thing than
those which the prophet and mose did say should come: 26:23 that
christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise
from the dead and should shew light unto the peopl and to the
gentil

26:24 and as he thu spake for himself festu said with a loud voic
paul thou art besid thyself; much learn doth make thee mad

26:25 but he said i am not mad most nobl festus; but speak forth
the word of truth and sober

26:26 for the king knoweth of these thing befor whom also i speak
freely: for i am persuad that none of these thing are hidden from
him; for thi thing wa not done in a corner

26:27 king agrippa believest thou the prophets? i know that thou
believest

26:28 then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a
christian

26:29 and paul said i would to god that not onli thou but also all
that hear me thi day were both almost and altogeth such as i am
except these bond

26:30 and when he had thu spoken the king rose up and the governor
and bernic and they that sat with them: 26:31 and when they were
gone asid they talk between themselv say thi man doeth
noth worthi of death or of bond

26:32 then said agrippa unto festu thi man might have been set at
liberti if he had not appeal unto caesar

27:1 and when it wa determin that we should sail into itali they
deliv paul and certain other prison unto one name juliu a
centurion of augustu band

27:2 and enter into a ship of adramyttium we launch mean to
sail by the coast of asia; one aristarchu a macedonian of
thessalonica be with us

27:3 and the next day we touch at sidon and juliu courteous
entreat paul and gave him liberti to go unto hi friend to refresh
himself

27:4 and when we had launch from thenc we sail under cypru
becaus the wind were contrari

27:5 and when we had sail over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we
came to myra a citi of lycia

27:6 and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sail into
italy; and he put us therein

27:7 and when we had sail slowli mani day and scarc were come
over against cnidu the wind not suffer us we sail under crete
over against salmone; 27:8 and hardli pass it came unto a place
which is call the fair havens; nigh whereunto wa the citi of lasea

27:9 now when much time wa spent and when sail wa now danger
becaus the fast wa now alreadi past paul admonish them 27:10 and
said unto them sir i perceiv that thi voyag will be with hurt
and much damag not onli of the lade and ship but also of our
live

27:11 nevertheless the centurion believ the master and the owner of
the ship more than those thing which were spoken by paul

27:12 and becaus the haven wa not commodi to winter in the more
part advis to depart thenc also if by ani mean they might attain
to phenic and there to winter; which is an haven of crete and lieth
toward the south west and north west

27:13 and when the south wind blew softli suppos that they had
obtain their purpos loos thenc they sail close by crete

27:14 but not long after there aros against it a tempestu wind
call euroclydon

27:15 and when the ship wa caught and could not bear up into the
wind we let her drive

27:16 and run under a certain island which is call clauda we
had much work to come by the boat: 27:17 which when they had taken up
they use help undergird the ship; and fear lest they should
fall into the quicksand strake sail and so were driven

27:18 and we be exceedingli toss with a tempest the next day
they lighten the ship; 27:19 and the third day we cast out with our
own hand the tackl of the ship

27:20 and when neither sun nor star in mani day appear and no
small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be save wa then
taken away

27:21 but after long abstin paul stood forth in the midst of them
and said sir ye should have hearken unto me and not have loos
from crete and to have gain thi harm and loss

27:22 and now i exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no
loss of ani man life among you but of the ship

27:23 for there stood by me thi night the angel of god whose i am
and whom i serv 27:24 say fear not paul; thou must be brought
befor caesar: and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with
thee

27:25 wherefor sir be of good cheer: for i believ god that it
shall be even as it wa told me

27:26 howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island

27:27 but when the fourteenth night wa come as we were driven up and
down in adria about midnight the shipmen deem that they drew near
to some country; 27:28 and sound and found it twenti fathoms: and
when they had gone a littl further they sound again and found it
fifteen fathom

27:29 then fear lest we should have fallen upon rock they cast
four anchor out of the stern and wish for the day

27:30 and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they
had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would
have cast anchor out of the foreship 27:31 paul said to the
centurion and to the soldier except these abid in the ship ye
cannot be save

27:32 then the soldier cut off the rope of the boat and let her
fall off

27:33 and while the day wa come on paul besought them all to take
meat say thi day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarri and
continu fast have taken noth

27:34 wherefor i pray you to take some meat: for thi is for your
health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of ani of you

27:35 and when he had thu spoken he took bread and gave thank to
god in presenc of them all: and when he had broken it he began to
eat

27:36 then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat

27:37 and we were in all in the ship two hundr threescor and
sixteen soul

27:38 and when they had eaten enough they lighten the ship and
cast out the wheat into the sea

27:39 and when it wa day they knew not the land: but they discov
a certain creek with a shore into the which they were mind if it
were possibl to thrust in the ship

27:40 and when they had taken up the anchor they commit
themselv unto the sea and loos the rudder band and hois up
the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore

27:41 and fall into a place where two sea met they ran the ship
aground; and the forepart stuck fast and remain unmov but the
hinder part wa broken with the violenc of the wave

27:42 and the soldier counsel wa to kill the prison lest ani of
them should swim out and escap

27:43 but the centurion will to save paul kept them from their
purpose; and command that they which could swim should cast
themselv first into the sea and get to land: 27:44 and the rest
some on board and some on broken piec of the ship

and so it came to pass that they escap all safe to land

28:1 and when they were escap then they knew that the island wa
call melita

28:2 and the barbar peopl shew us no littl kindness: for they
kindl a fire and receiv us everi one becaus of the present
rain and becaus of the cold

28:3 and when paul had gather a bundl of stick and laid them on
the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fasten on hi
hand

28:4 and when the barbarian saw the venom beast hang on hi hand
they said among themselv no doubt thi man is a murder whom
though he hath escap the sea yet vengeanc suffereth not to live

28:5 and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm

28:6 howbeit they look when he should have swollen or fallen down
dead suddenly: but after they had look a great while and saw no
harm come to him they chang their mind and said that he wa a
god

28:7 in the same quarter were possess of the chief man of the
island whose name wa publius; who receiv us and lodg us three
day courteous

28:8 and it came to pass that the father of publiu lay sick of a
fever and of a bloodi flux: to whom paul enter in and pray and
laid hi hand on him and heal him

28:9 so when thi wa done other also which had diseas in the
island came and were healed: 28:10 who also honour us with mani
honours; and when we depart they lade us with such thing as were
necessari

28:11 and after three month we depart in a ship of alexandria
which had winter in the isl whose sign wa castor and pollux

28:12 and land at syracus we tarri there three day

28:13 and from thenc we fetch a compass and came to rhegium: and
after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to
puteoli: 28:14 where we found brethren and were desir to tarri with
them seven days: and so we went toward rome

28:15 and from thenc when the brethren heard of us they came to
meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns: whom when paul
saw he thank god and took courag

28:16 and when we came to rome the centurion deliv the prison
to the captain of the guard: but paul wa suffer to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him

28:17 and it came to pass that after three day paul call the chief
of the jew together: and when they were come togeth he said unto
them men and brethren though i have commit noth against the
peopl or custom of our father yet wa i deliv prison from
jerusalem into the hand of the roman

28:18 who when they had examin me would have let me go becaus
there wa no caus of death in me

28:19 but when the jew spake against it i wa constrain to appeal
unto caesar; not that i had ought to accus my nation of

28:20 for thi caus therefor have i call for you to see you and
to speak with you: becaus that for the hope of israel i am bound with
thi chain

28:21 and they said unto him we neither receiv letter out of
judaea concern thee neither ani of the brethren that came shew
or spake ani harm of thee

28:22 but we desir to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
concern thi sect we know that everi where it is spoken against

28:23 and when they had appoint him a day there came mani to him
into hi lodging; to whom he expound and testifi the kingdom of
god persuad them concern jesu both out of the law of mose
and out of the prophet from morn till even

28:24 and some believ the thing which were spoken and some
believ not

28:25 and when they agre not among themselv they depart after
that paul had spoken one word well spake the holi ghost by esaia the
prophet unto our father 28:26 say go unto thi peopl and say
hear ye shall hear and shall not understand; and see ye shall
see and not perceive: 28:27 for the heart of thi peopl is wax
gross and their ear are dull of hear and their eye have they
closed; lest they should see with their eye and hear with their
ear and understand with their heart and should be convert and i
should heal them

28:28 be it known therefor unto you that the salvat of god is
sent unto the gentil and that they will hear it

28:29 and when he had said these word the jew depart and had
great reason among themselv

28:30 and paul dwelt two whole year in hi own hire hous and
receiv all that came in unto him 28:31 preach the kingdom of
god and teach those thing which concern the lord jesu christ
with all confid no man forbid him




the epistl of paul the apostl to the roman


1:1 paul a servant of jesu christ call to be an apostl
separ unto the gospel of god 1:2 (which he had promis afor by
hi prophet in the holi scriptures) 1:3 concern hi son jesu
christ our lord which wa made of the seed of david accord to the
flesh; 1:4 and declar to be the son of god with power accord to
the spirit of holi by the resurrect from the dead: 1:5 by whom
we have receiv grace and apostleship for obedi to the faith
among all nation for hi name: 1:6 among whom are ye also the call
of jesu christ: 1:7 to all that be in rome belov of god call to
be saints: grace to you and peac from god our father and the lord
jesu christ

1:8 first i thank my god through jesu christ for you all that your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world

1:9 for god is my wit whom i serv with my spirit in the gospel
of hi son that without ceas i make mention of you alway in my
prayers; 1:10 make request if by ani mean now at length i might
have a prosper journey by the will of god to come unto you

1:11 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritu
gift to the end ye may be established; 1:12 that is that i may be
comfort togeth with you by the mutual faith both of you and me

1:13 now i would not have you ignor brethren that oftentim i
purpos to come unto you (but wa let hitherto) that i might have
some fruit among you also even as among other gentil

1:14 i am debtor both to the greek and to the barbarians; both to
the wise and to the unwis

1:15 so as much as in me is i am readi to preach the gospel to you
that are at rome also

1:16 for i am not asham of the gospel of christ: for it is the power
of god unto salvat to everi one that believeth; to the jew first
and also to the greek

1:17 for therein is the righteous of god reveal from faith to
faith: as it is written the just shall live by faith

1:18 for the wrath of god is reveal from heaven against all
ungodli and unright of men who hold the truth in
unrighteousness; 1:19 becaus that which may be known of god is
manifest in them; for god hath shew it unto them

1:20 for the invis thing of him from the creation of the world
are clearli seen be understood by the thing that are made even
hi etern power and godhead; so that they are without excuse: 1:21
becaus that when they knew god they glorifi him not as god
neither were thankful; but becam vain in their imagin and
their foolish heart wa darken

1:22 profess themselv to be wise they becam fool 1:23 and
chang the glori of the uncorrupt god into an imag made like to
corrupt man and to bird and fourfoot beast and creep
thing

1:24 wherefor god also gave them up to unclean through the lust
of their own heart to dishonour their own bodi between themselves:
1:25 who chang the truth of god into a lie and worship and
serv the creatur more than the creator who is bless for ever
amen

1:26 for thi caus god gave them up unto vile affections: for even
their women did chang the natur use into that which is against
nature: 1:27 and likewis also the men leav the natur use of the
woman burn in their lust one toward another; men with men work
that which is unseemli and receiv in themselv that recomp of
their error which wa meet

1:28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledg
god gave them over to a reprob mind to do those thing which are
not convenient; 1:29 be fill with all unright
fornic wicked covet maliciousness; full of envi
murder debat deceit malignity; whisper 1:30 backbit hater
of god despit proud boaster inventor of evil thing
disobedi to parent 1:31 without understand covenantbreak
without natur affect implac unmerciful: 1:32 who know
the judgment of god that they which commit such thing are worthi of
death not onli do the same but have pleasur in them that do them

2:1 therefor thou art inexcus o man whosoev thou art that
judgest: for wherein thou judgest anoth thou condemnest thyself;
for thou that judgest doest the same thing

2:2 but we are sure that the judgment of god is accord to truth
against them which commit such thing

2:3 and thinkest thou thi o man that judgest them which do such
thing and doest the same that thou shalt escap the judgment of
god? 2:4 or despisest thou the rich of hi good and forbear
and longsuffering; not know that the good of god leadeth thee
to repentance? 2:5 but after thi hard and impenit heart
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and
revel of the righteou judgment of god; 2:6 who will render to
everi man accord to hi deeds: 2:7 to them who by patient
continu in well do seek for glori and honour and immort
etern life: 2:8 but unto them that are contenti and do not obey
the truth but obey unright indign and wrath 2:9
tribul and anguish upon everi soul of man that doeth evil of
the jew first and also of the gentile; 2:10 but glori honour and
peac to everi man that worketh good to the jew first and also to
the gentile: 2:11 for there is no respect of person with god

2:12 for as mani as have sin without law shall also perish without
law: and as mani as have sin in the law shall be judg by the law;
2:13 (for not the hearer of the law are just befor god but the
doer of the law shall be justifi

2:14 for when the gentil which have not the law do by natur the
thing contain in the law these have not the law are a law unto
themselves: 2:15 which shew the work of the law written in their
heart their conscienc also bear wit and their thought the
mean while accus or els excus one another;) 2:16 in the day
when god shall judg the secret of men by jesu christ accord to
my gospel

2:17 behold thou art call a jew and restest in the law and makest
thi boast of god 2:18 and knowest hi will and approvest the thing
that are more excel be instruct out of the law; 2:19 and art
confid that thou thyself art a guid of the blind a light of them
which are in dark 2:20 an instructor of the foolish a teacher of
babe which hast the form of knowledg and of the truth in the law

2:21 thou therefor which teachest anoth teachest thou not thyself?
thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal? 2:22
thou that sayest a man should not commit adulteri dost thou commit
adultery? thou that abhorrest idol dost thou commit sacrilege? 2:23
thou that makest thi boast of the law through break the law
dishonourest thou god? 2:24 for the name of god is blasphem among
the gentil through you as it is written

2:25 for circumcis verili profiteth if thou keep the law: but if
thou be a breaker of the law thi circumcis is made uncircumcis

2:26 therefor if the uncircumcis keep the righteous of the
law shall not hi uncircumcis be count for circumcision? 2:27
and shall not uncircumcis which is by natur if it fulfil the law
judg thee who by the letter and circumcis dost transgress the
law? 2:28 for he is not a jew which is one outwardly; neither is
that circumcis which is outward in the flesh: 2:29 but he is a
jew which is one inwardly; and circumcis is that of the heart in
the spirit and not in the letter; whose prais is not of men but of
god

3:1 what advantag then hath the jew? or what profit is there of
circumcision? 3:2 much everi way: chiefli becaus that unto them
were commit the oracl of god

3:3 for what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
faith of god without effect? 3:4 god forbid: yea let god be true
but everi man a liar; as it is written that thou mightest be
justifi in thi say and mightest overcom when thou art judg

3:5 but if our unright commend the righteous of god what
shall we say? is god unright who taketh vengeance? (i speak as a
man) 3:6 god forbid: for then how shall god judg the world? 3:7 for
if the truth of god hath more abound through my lie unto hi glory;
whi yet am i also judg as a sinner? 3:8 and not rather (a we be
slander report and as some affirm that we say) let us do
evil that good may come? whose damnat is just

3:9 what then? are we better than they? no in no wise: for we have
befor prove both jew and gentil that they are all under sin;
3:10 as it is written there is none righteou no not one: 3:11
there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after
god

3:12 they are all gone out of the way they are togeth becom
unprofitable; there is none that doeth good no not one

3:13 their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongu they have
use deceit; the poison of asp is under their lips: 3:14 whose mouth
is full of curs and bitterness: 3:15 their feet are swift to shed
blood: 3:16 destruct and miseri are in their ways: 3:17 and the way
of peac have they not known: 3:18 there is no fear of god befor
their eye

3:19 now we know that what thing soever the law saith it saith to
them who are under the law: that everi mouth may be stop and all
the world may becom guilti befor god

3:20 therefor by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be
justifi in hi sight: for by the law is the knowledg of sin

3:21 but now the righteous of god without the law is manifest
be wit by the law and the prophets; 3:22 even the
righteous of god which is by faith of jesu christ unto all and
upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 3:23 for all
have sin and come short of the glori of god; 3:24 be justifi
freeli by hi grace through the redempt that is in christ jesus:
3:25 whom god hath set forth to be a propiti through faith in hi
blood to declar hi righteous for the remiss of sin that are
past through the forbear of god; 3:26 to declar i say at thi
time hi righteousness: that he might be just and the justifi of
him which believeth in jesu

3:27 where is boast then? it is exclud by what law? of works?
nay: but by the law of faith

3:28 therefor we conclud that a man is justifi by faith without
the deed of the law

3:29 is he the god of the jew only? is he not also of the gentiles?
ye of the gentil also: 3:30 see it is one god which shall
justifi the circumcis by faith and uncircumcis through faith

3:31 do we then make void the law through faith? god forbid: yea we
establish the law

4:1 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertain to
the flesh hath found? 4:2 for if abraham were justifi by work he
hath whereof to glory; but not befor god

4:3 for what saith the scripture? abraham believ god and it wa
count unto him for righteous

4:4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but
of debt

4:5 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodli hi faith is count for righteous

4:6 even as david also describeth the blessed of the man unto
whom god imputeth righteous without work 4:7 say bless are
they whose iniqu are forgiven and whose sin are cover

4:8 bless is the man to whom the lord will not imput sin

4:9 cometh thi blessed then upon the circumcis onli or upon
the uncircumcis also? for we say that faith wa reckon to abraham
for righteous

4:10 how wa it then reckoned? when he wa in circumcis or in
uncircumcision? not in circumcis but in uncircumcis

4:11 and he receiv the sign of circumcis a seal of the
righteous of the faith which he had yet be uncircumcised: that
he might be the father of all them that believ though they be not
circumcised; that righteous might be imput unto them also: 4:12
and the father of circumcis to them who are not of the circumcis
onli but who also walk in the step of that faith of our father
abraham which he had be yet uncircumcis

4:13 for the promis that he should be the heir of the world wa not
to abraham or to hi seed through the law but through the
righteous of faith

4:14 for if they which are of the law be heir faith is made void
and the promis made of none effect: 4:15 becaus the law worketh
wrath: for where no law is there is no transgress

4:16 therefor it is of faith that it might be by grace; to the end
the promis might be sure to all the seed; not to that onli which is
of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham; who is
the father of us all 4:17 (a it is written i have made thee a
father of mani nations) befor him whom he believ even god who
quickeneth the dead and calleth those thing which be not as though
they were

4:18 who against hope believ in hope that he might becom the
father of mani nation accord to that which wa spoken so shall
thi seed be

4:19 and be not weak in faith he consid not hi own bodi now
dead when he wa about an hundr year old neither yet the dead
of sarah womb: 4:20 he stagger not at the promis of god through
unbelief; but wa strong in faith give glori to god; 4:21 and be
fulli persuad that what he had promis he wa abl also to
perform

4:22 and therefor it wa imput to him for righteous

4:23 now it wa not written for hi sake alon that it wa imput to
him; 4:24 but for us also to whom it shall be imput if we believ
on him that rais up jesu our lord from the dead; 4:25 who wa
deliv for our offenc and wa rais again for our
justif

5:1 therefor be justifi by faith we have peac with god through
our lord jesu christ: 5:2 by whom also we have access by faith into
thi grace wherein we stand and rejoic in hope of the glori of god

5:3 and not onli so but we glori in tribul also: know that
tribul worketh patience; 5:4 and patienc experience; and
experi hope: 5:5 and hope maketh not ashamed; becaus the love of
god is shed abroad in our heart by the holi ghost which is given unto
us

5:6 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ die for
the ungodli

5:7 for scarc for a righteou man will one die: yet peradventur
for a good man some would even dare to die

5:8 but god commendeth hi love toward us in that while we were yet
sinner christ die for us

5:9 much more then be now justifi by hi blood we shall be
save from wrath through him

5:10 for if when we were enemi we were reconcil to god by the
death of hi son much more be reconcil we shall be save by
hi life

5:11 and not onli so but we also joy in god through our lord jesu
christ by whom we have now receiv the aton

5:12 wherefor as by one man sin enter into the world and death by
sin; and so death pass upon all men for that all have sinned: 5:13
(for until the law sin wa in the world: but sin is not imput when
there is no law

5:14 nevertheless death reign from adam to mose even over them
that had not sin after the similitud of adam transgress who
is the figur of him that wa to come

5:15 but not as the offenc so also is the free gift for if through
the offenc of one mani be dead much more the grace of god and the
gift by grace which is by one man jesu christ hath abound unto
mani

5:16 and not as it wa by one that sin so is the gift: for the
judgment wa by one to condemn but the free gift is of mani
offenc unto justif

5:17 for if by one man offenc death reign by one; much more they
which receiv abund of grace and of the gift of righteous
shall reign in life by one jesu christ) 5:18 therefor as by the
offenc of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
the righteous of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justif of life

5:19 for as by one man disobedi mani were made sinner so by
the obedi of one shall mani be made righteou

5:20 moreov the law enter that the offenc might abound but
where sin abound grace did much more abound: 5:21 that as sin hath
reign unto death even so might grace reign through righteous
unto etern life by jesu christ our lord

6:1 what shall we say then? shall we continu in sin that grace may
abound? 6:2 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live ani
longer therein? 6:3 know ye not that so mani of us as were baptiz
into jesu christ were baptiz into hi death? 6:4 therefor we are
buri with him by baptism into death: that like as christ wa rais
up from the dead by the glori of the father even so we also should
walk in new of life

6:5 for if we have been plant togeth in the like of hi death
we shall be also in the like of hi resurrection: 6:6 know
thi that our old man is crucifi with him that the bodi of sin
might be destroy that henceforth we should not serv sin

6:7 for he that is dead is freed from sin

6:8 now if we be dead with christ we believ that we shall also live
with him: 6:9 know that christ be rais from the dead dieth no
more; death hath no more dominion over him

6:10 for in that he die he die unto sin once: but in that he
liveth he liveth unto god

6:11 likewis reckon ye also yourselv to be dead inde unto sin
but aliv unto god through jesu christ our lord

6:12 let not sin therefor reign in your mortal bodi that ye should
obey it in the lust thereof

6:13 neither yield ye your member as instrument of unright
unto sin: but yield yourselv unto god as those that are aliv from
the dead and your member as instrument of righteous unto god

6:14 for sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
the law but under grace

6:15 what then? shall we sin becaus we are not under the law but
under grace? god forbid

6:16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselv servant to obey
hi servant ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death or of
obedi unto righteousness? 6:17 but god be thank that ye were
the servant of sin but ye have obey from the heart that form of
doctrin which wa deliv you

6:18 be then made free from sin ye becam the servant of
righteous

6:19 i speak after the manner of men becaus of the infirm of your
flesh: for as ye have yield your member servant to unclean and
to iniqu unto iniquity; even so now yield your member servant to
righteous unto holi

6:20 for when ye were the servant of sin ye were free from
righteous

6:21 what fruit had ye then in those thing whereof ye are now
ashamed? for the end of those thing is death

6:22 but now be made free from sin and becom servant to god ye
have your fruit unto holi and the end everlast life

6:23 for the wage of sin is death; but the gift of god is etern
life through jesu christ our lord

7:1 know ye not brethren (for i speak to them that know the law)
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 7:2
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead she is loos from
the law of her husband

7:3 so then if while her husband liveth she be marri to anoth
man she shall be call an adulteress: but if her husband be dead
she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress though she be
marri to anoth man

7:4 wherefor my brethren ye also are becom dead to the law by the
bodi of christ; that ye should be marri to anoth even to him who
is rais from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god

7:5 for when we were in the flesh the motion of sin which were by
the law did work in our member to bring forth fruit unto death

7:6 but now we are deliv from the law that be dead wherein we
were held; that we should serv in new of spirit and not in the
old of the letter

7:7 what shall we say then? is the law sin? god forbid nay i had not
known sin but by the law: for i had not known lust except the law
had said thou shalt not covet

7:8 but sin take occas by the command wrought in me all
manner of concupisc for without the law sin wa dead

7:9 for i wa aliv without the law once: but when the command
came sin reviv and i die

7:10 and the command which wa ordain to life i found to be
unto death

7:11 for sin take occas by the command deceiv me and by
it slew me

7:12 wherefor the law is holi and the command holi and just
and good

7:13 wa then that which is good made death unto me? god forbid but
sin that it might appear sin work death in me by that which is
good; that sin by the command might becom exceed sin

7:14 for we know that the law is spiritual: but i am carnal sold
under sin

7:15 for that which i do i allow not: for what i would that do i not;
but what i hate that do i

7:16 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that
it is good

7:17 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me

7:18 for i know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good
thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which
is good i find not

7:19 for the good that i would i do not: but the evil which i would
not that i do

7:20 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin
that dwelleth in me

7:21 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present
with me

7:22 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man: 7:23 but i
see anoth law in my member war against the law of my mind and
bring me into captiv to the law of sin which is in my member

7:24 o wretch man that i am! who shall deliv me from the bodi of
thi death? 7:25 i thank god through jesu christ our lord so then
with the mind i myself serv the law of god; but with the flesh the
law of sin

8:1 there is therefor now no condemn to them which are in christ
jesu who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit

8:2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesu hath made me
free from the law of sin and death

8:3 for what the law could not do in that it wa weak through the
flesh god send hi own son in the like of sin flesh and
for sin condemn sin in the flesh: 8:4 that the righteous of the
law might be fulfil in us who walk not after the flesh but after
the spirit

8:5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the thing of the flesh;
but they that are after the spirit the thing of the spirit

8:6 for to be carnal mind is death; but to be spiritu mind
is life and peac

8:7 becaus the carnal mind is enmiti against god: for it is not
subject to the law of god neither inde can be

8:8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot pleas god

8:9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the
spirit of god dwell in you now if ani man have not the spirit of
christ he is none of hi

8:10 and if christ be in you the bodi is dead becaus of sin; but the
spirit is life becaus of righteous

8:11 but if the spirit of him that rais up jesu from the dead dwell
in you he that rais up christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodi by hi spirit that dwelleth in you

8:12 therefor brethren we are debtor not to the flesh to live
after the flesh

8:13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die: but if ye through
the spirit do mortifi the deed of the bodi ye shall live

8:14 for as mani as are led by the spirit of god they are the son of
god

8:15 for ye have not receiv the spirit of bondag again to fear; but
ye have receiv the spirit of adopt wherebi we cri abba father

8:16 the spirit itself beareth wit with our spirit that we are
the children of god: 8:17 and if children then heirs; heir of god
and joint-heir with christ; if so be that we suffer with him that we
may be also glorifi togeth

8:18 for i reckon that the suffer of thi present time are not
worthi to be compar with the glori which shall be reveal in us

8:19 for the earnest expect of the creatur waiteth for the
manifest of the son of god

8:20 for the creatur wa made subject to vaniti not willingli but
by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope 8:21 becaus the
creatur itself also shall be deliv from the bondag of corrupt
into the gloriou liberti of the children of god

8:22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain togeth until now

8:23 and not onli they but ourselv also which have the firstfruit
of the spirit even we ourselv groan within ourselv wait for
the adopt to wit the redempt of our bodi

8:24 for we are save by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
what a man seeth whi doth he yet hope for? 8:25 but if we hope for
that we see not then do we with patienc wait for it

8:26 likewis the spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the spirit itself maketh
intercess for us with groan which cannot be utter

8:27 and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the
spirit becaus he maketh intercess for the saint accord to the
will of god

8:28 and we know that all thing work togeth for good to them that
love god to them who are the call accord to hi purpos

8:29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestin to be
conform to the imag of hi son that he might be the firstborn
among mani brethren

8:30 moreov whom he did predestin them he also called: and whom
he call them he also justified: and whom he justifi them he also
glorifi

8:31 what shall we then say to these things? if god be for us who can
be against us? 8:32 he that spare not hi own son but deliv him
up for us all how shall he not with him also freeli give us all
things? 8:33 who shall lay ani thing to the charg of god elect? it
is god that justifieth

8:34 who is he that condemneth? it is christ that die yea rather
that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also
maketh intercess for us

8:35 who shall separ us from the love of christ? shall tribul
or distress or persecut or famin or naked or peril or
sword? 8:36 as it is written for thi sake we are kill all the day
long; we are account as sheep for the slaughter

8:37 nay in all these thing we are more than conqueror through him
that love us

8:38 for i am persuad that neither death nor life nor angel nor
princip nor power nor thing present nor thing to come
8:39 nor height nor depth nor ani other creatur shall be abl to
separ us from the love of god which is in christ jesu our lord

9:1 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscienc also bear
me wit in the holi ghost 9:2 that i have great heavi and
continu sorrow in my heart

9:3 for i could wish that myself were accurs from christ for my
brethren my kinsmen accord to the flesh: 9:4 who are israelites;
to whom pertaineth the adopt and the glori and the coven and
the give of the law and the servic of god and the promises; 9:5
whose are the father and of whom as concern the flesh christ
came who is over all god bless for ever amen

9:6 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are
not all israel which are of israel: 9:7 neither becaus they are the
seed of abraham are they all children: but in isaac shall thi seed
be call

9:8 that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not
the children of god: but the children of the promis are count for
the seed

9:9 for thi is the word of promis at thi time will i come and
sarah shall have a son

9:10 and not onli this; but when rebecca also had conceiv by one
even by our father isaac; 9:11 (for the children be not yet born
neither have done ani good or evil that the purpos of god
accord to elect might stand not of work but of him that
calleth;) 9:12 it wa said unto her the elder shall serv the
younger

9:13 as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hate

9:14 what shall we say then? is there unright with god? god
forbid

9:15 for he saith to mose i will have merci on whom i will have
merci and i will have compass on whom i will have compass

9:16 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth
but of god that sheweth merci

9:17 for the scriptur saith unto pharaoh even for thi same purpos
have i rais thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my
name might be declar throughout all the earth

9:18 therefor hath he merci on whom he will have merci and whom he
will he hardeneth

9:19 thou wilt say then unto me whi doth he yet find fault? for who
hath resist hi will? 9:20 nay but o man who art thou that
repliest against god? shall the thing form say to him that form
it whi hast thou made me thus? 9:21 hath not the potter power over
the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and anoth
unto dishonour? 9:22 what if god will to shew hi wrath and to
make hi power known endur with much longsuff the vessel of
wrath fit to destruction: 9:23 and that he might make known the
rich of hi glori on the vessel of merci which he had afor
prepar unto glori 9:24 even us whom he hath call not of the
jew onli but also of the gentiles? 9:25 as he saith also in ose i
will call them my peopl which were not my people; and her belov
which wa not belov

9:26 and it shall come to pass that in the place where it wa said
unto them ye are not my people; there shall they be call the
children of the live god

9:27 esaia also crieth concern israel though the number of the
children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be
saved: 9:28 for he will finish the work and cut it short in
righteousness: becaus a short work will the lord make upon the earth

9:29 and as esaia said befor except the lord of sabaoth had left us
a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha

9:30 what shall we say then? that the gentil which follow not
after righteous have attain to righteous even the
righteous which is of faith

9:31 but israel which follow after the law of righteous hath
not attain to the law of righteous

9:32 wherefore? becaus they sought it not by faith but as it were by
the work of the law for they stumbl at that stumblingstone; 9:33
as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingston and rock of
offence: and whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham

10:1 brethren my heart desir and prayer to god for israel is that
they might be save

10:2 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not
accord to knowledg

10:3 for they be ignor of god righteous and go about
to establish their own righteous have not submit themselv
unto the righteous of god

10:4 for christ is the end of the law for righteous to everi one
that believeth

10:5 for mose describeth the righteous which is of the law that
the man which doeth those thing shall live by them

10:6 but the righteous which is of faith speaketh on thi wise
say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven? (that is to
bring christ down from above:) 10:7 or who shall descend into the
deep? (that is to bring up christ again from the dead) 10:8 but
what saith it? the word is nigh thee even in thi mouth and in thi
heart: that is the word of faith which we preach; 10:9 that if thou
shalt confess with thi mouth the lord jesu and shalt believ in
thine heart that god hath rais him from the dead thou shalt be
save

10:10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confess is made unto salvat

10:11 for the scriptur saith whosoev believeth on him shall not be
asham

10:12 for there is no differ between the jew and the greek: for
the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him

10:13 for whosoev shall call upon the name of the lord shall be
save

10:14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
and how shall they believ in him of whom they have not heard? and how
shall they hear without a preacher? 10:15 and how shall they preach
except they be sent? as it is written how beauti are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peac and bring glad tide of good
things! 10:16 but they have not all obey the gospel for esaia
saith lord who hath believ our report? 10:17 so then faith cometh
by hear and hear by the word of god

10:18 but i say have they not heard? ye verili their sound went
into all the earth and their word unto the end of the world

10:19 but i say did not israel know? first mose saith i will
provok you to jealousi by them that are no peopl and by a foolish
nation i will anger you

10:20 but esaia is veri bold and saith i wa found of them that
sought me not; i wa made manifest unto them that ask not after me

10:21 but to israel he saith all day long i have stretch forth my
hand unto a disobedi and gainsay peopl

11:1 i say then hath god cast away hi people? god forbid for i also
am an israelit of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin

11:2 god hath not cast away hi peopl which he foreknew wot ye not
what the scriptur saith of elias? how he maketh intercess to god
against israel say 11:3 lord they have kill thi prophet and
dig down thine altars; and i am left alon and they seek my life

11:4 but what saith the answer of god unto him? i have reserv to
myself seven thousand men who have not bow the knee to the imag of
baal

11:5 even so then at thi present time also there is a remnant
accord to the elect of grace

11:6 and if by grace then is it no more of works: otherwis grace is
no more grace but if it be of work then it is no more grace:
otherwis work is no more work

11:7 what then? israel hath not obtain that which he seeketh for;
but the elect hath obtain it and the rest were blind

11:8 (accord as it is written god hath given them the spirit of
slumber eye that they should not see and ear that they should not
hear;) unto thi day

11:9 and david saith let their tabl be made a snare and a trap and
a stumblingblock and a recomp unto them: 11:10 let their eye be
darken that they may not see and bow down their back alway

11:11 i say then have they stumbl that they should fall? god
forbid: but rather through their fall salvat is come unto the
gentil for to provok them to jealousi

11:12 now if the fall of them be the rich of the world and the
diminish of them the rich of the gentiles; how much more their
fulness? 11:13 for i speak to you gentil inasmuch as i am the
apostl of the gentil i magnifi mine office: 11:14 if by ani mean
i may provok to emul them which are my flesh and might save
some of them

11:15 for if the cast away of them be the reconcil of the world
what shall the receiv of them be but life from the dead? 11:16
for if the firstfruit be holi the lump is also holy: and if the root
be holi so are the branch

11:17 and if some of the branch be broken off and thou be a
wild oliv tree wert graf in among them and with them partakest
of the root and fat of the oliv tree; 11:18 boast not against the
branch but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root
thee

11:19 thou wilt say then the branch were broken off that i might
be graf in

11:20 well; becaus of unbelief they were broken off and thou
standest by faith be not highmind but fear: 11:21 for if god
spare not the natur branch take heed lest he also spare not
thee

11:22 behold therefor the good and sever of god: on them which
fell severity; but toward thee good if thou continu in hi
goodness: otherwis thou also shalt be cut off

11:23 and they also if they abid not still in unbelief shall be
graf in: for god is abl to graff them in again

11:24 for if thou wert cut out of the oliv tree which is wild by
natur and wert graf contrari to natur into a good oliv tree:
how much more shall these which be the natur branch be graf
into their own oliv tree? 11:25 for i would not brethren that ye
should be ignor of thi mysteri lest ye should be wise in your own
conceits; that blind in part is happen to israel until the
ful of the gentil be come in

11:26 and so all israel shall be saved: as it is written there shall
come out of sion the deliver and shall turn away ungodli from
jacob: 11:27 for thi is my coven unto them when i shall take away
their sin

11:28 as concern the gospel they are enemi for your sakes: but
as touch the elect they are belov for the father sake

11:29 for the gift and call of god are without repent

11:30 for as ye in time past have not believ god yet have now
obtain merci through their unbelief: 11:31 even so have these also
now not believ that through your merci they also may obtain merci

11:32 for god hath conclud them all in unbelief that he might have
merci upon all

11:33 o the depth of the rich both of the wisdom and knowledg of
god! how unsearch are hi judgment and hi way past find
out! 11:34 for who hath known the mind of the lord? or who hath been
hi counsellor? 11:35 or who hath first given to him and it shall be
recompens unto him again? 11:36 for of him and through him and to
him are all things: to whom be glori for ever amen

12:1 i beseech you therefor brethren by the merci of god that ye
present your bodi a live sacrific holi accept unto god
which is your reason servic

12:2 and be not conform to thi world: but be ye transform by the
renew of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and
accept and perfect will of god

12:3 for i say through the grace given unto me to everi man that is
among you not to think of himself more highli than he ought to think;
but to think soberli accord as god hath dealt to everi man the
measur of faith

12:4 for as we have mani member in one bodi and all member have not
the same office: 12:5 so we be mani are one bodi in christ and
everi one member one of anoth

12:6 have then gift differ accord to the grace that is given
to us whether propheci let us prophesi accord to the proport
of faith; 12:7 or ministri let us wait on our ministering: or he that
teacheth on teaching; 12:8 or he that exhorteth on exhortation: he
that giveth let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth with
diligence; he that sheweth merci with cheer

12:9 let love be without dissimul abhor that which is evil;
cleav to that which is good

12:10 be kindli affect one to anoth with brotherli love; in
honour prefer one another; 12:11 not sloth in business; fervent
in spirit; serv the lord; 12:12 rejoic in hope; patient in
tribulation; continu instant in prayer; 12:13 distribut to the
necess of saints; given to hospit

12:14 bless them which persecut you: bless and curs not

12:15 rejoic with them that do rejoic and weep with them that weep

12:16 be of the same mind one toward anoth mind not high thing
but condescend to men of low estat be not wise in your own conceit

12:17 recompens to no man evil for evil provid thing honest in the
sight of all men

12:18 if it be possibl as much as lieth in you live peaceabl with
all men

12:19 dearli belov aveng not yourselv but rather give place
unto wrath: for it is written vengeanc is mine; i will repay saith
the lord

12:20 therefor if thine enemi hunger feed him; if he thirst give
him drink: for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire on hi head

12:21 be not overcom of evil but overcom evil with good

13:1 let everi soul be subject unto the higher power for there is no
power but of god: the power that be are ordain of god

13:2 whosoev therefor resisteth the power resisteth the ordin
of god: and they that resist shall receiv to themselv damnat

13:3 for ruler are not a terror to good work but to the evil wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good and thou
shalt have prais of the same: 13:4 for he is the minist of god to
thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minist of god a
reveng to execut wrath upon him that doeth evil

13:5 wherefor ye must need be subject not onli for wrath but also
for conscienc sake

13:6 for for thi caus pay ye tribut also: for they are god
minist attend continu upon thi veri thing

13:7 render therefor to all their dues: tribut to whom tribut is
due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour

13:8 owe no man ani thing but to love one another: for he that loveth
anoth hath fulfil the law

13:9 for thi thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear fals wit thou shalt
not covet; and if there be ani other command it is briefli
comprehend in thi say name thou shalt love thi neighbour as
thyself

13:10 love worketh no ill to hi neighbour: therefor love is the
fulfil of the law

13:11 and that know the time that now it is high time to awak
out of sleep: for now is our salvat nearer than when we believ

13:12 the night is far spent the day is at hand: let us therefor
cast off the work of dark and let us put on the armour of light

13:13 let us walk honestli as in the day; not in riot and
drunken not in chamber and wanton not in strife and
envi

13:14 but put ye on the lord jesu christ and make not provis for
the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof

14:1 him that is weak in the faith receiv ye but not to doubt
disput

14:2 for one believeth that he may eat all things: anoth who is
weak eateth herb

14:3 let not him that eateth despis him that eateth not; and let not
him which eateth not judg him that eateth: for god hath receiv him

14:4 who art thou that judgest anoth man servant? to hi own
master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up: for god is
abl to make him stand

14:5 one man esteemeth one day abov another: anoth esteemeth everi
day alik let everi man be fulli persuad in hi own mind

14:6 he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord; and he
that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that
eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks; and he that
eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thank

14:7 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself

14:8 for whether we live we live unto the lord; and whether we die
we die unto the lord: whether we live therefor or die we are the
lord

14:9 for to thi end christ both die and rose and reviv that he
might be lord both of the dead and live

14:10 but whi dost thou judg thi brother? or whi dost thou set at
nought thi brother? for we shall all stand befor the judgment seat of
christ

14:11 for it is written as i live saith the lord everi knee shall
bow to me and everi tongu shall confess to god

14:12 so then everi one of us shall give account of himself to god

14:13 let us not therefor judg one anoth ani more: but judg thi
rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occas to fall in hi
brother way

14:14 i know and am persuad by the lord jesu that there is
noth unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth ani thing to be
unclean to him it is unclean

14:15 but if thi brother be griev with thi meat now walkest thou
not charit destroy not him with thi meat for whom christ die

14:16 let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17 for the kingdom
of god is not meat and drink; but righteous and peac and joy in
the holi ghost

14:18 for he that in these thing serveth christ is accept to god
and approv of men

14:19 let us therefor follow after the thing which make for peac
and thing wherewith one may edifi anoth

14:20 for meat destroy not the work of god all thing inde are
pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offenc

14:21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor ani
thing wherebi thi brother stumbleth or is offend or is made weak

14:22 hast thou faith? have it to thyself befor god happi is he that
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth

14:23 and he that doubteth is damn if he eat becaus he eateth not
of faith: for whatsoev is not of faith is sin

15:1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirm of the
weak and not to pleas ourselv

15:2 let everi one of us pleas hi neighbour for hi good to
edif

15:3 for even christ pleas not himself; but as it is written the
reproach of them that reproach thee fell on me

15:4 for whatsoev thing were written aforetim were written for our
learn that we through patienc and comfort of the scriptur might
have hope

15:5 now the god of patienc and consol grant you to be
likemind one toward anoth accord to christ jesus: 15:6 that ye
may with one mind and one mouth glorifi god even the father of our
lord jesu christ

15:7 wherefor receiv ye one anoth as christ also receiv us to
the glori of god

15:8 now i say that jesu christ wa a minist of the circumcis
for the truth of god to confirm the promis made unto the fathers:
15:9 and that the gentil might glorifi god for hi mercy; as it is
written for thi caus i will confess to thee among the gentil and
sing unto thi name

15:10 and again he saith rejoic ye gentil with hi peopl

15:11 and again prais the lord all ye gentiles; and laud him all
ye peopl

15:12 and again esaia saith there shall be a root of jess and he
that shall rise to reign over the gentiles; in him shall the gentil
trust

15:13 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peac in
believ that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holi
ghost

15:14 and i myself also am persuad of you my brethren that ye also
are full of good fill with all knowledg abl also to admonish
one anoth

15:15 nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldli unto you
in some sort as put you in mind becaus of the grace that is
given to me of god 15:16 that i should be the minist of jesu
christ to the gentil minist the gospel of god that the
offer up of the gentil might be accept be sanctifi by
the holi ghost

15:17 i have therefor whereof i may glori through jesu christ in
those thing which pertain to god

15:18 for i will not dare to speak of ani of those thing which christ
hath not wrought by me to make the gentil obedi by word and
deed 15:19 through mighti sign and wonder by the power of the
spirit of god; so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum
i have fulli preach the gospel of christ

15:20 yea so have i strive to preach the gospel not where christ
wa name lest i should build upon anoth man foundation: 15:21
but as it is written to whom he wa not spoken of they shall see:
and they that have not heard shall understand

15:22 for which caus also i have been much hinder from come to
you

15:23 but now have no more place in these part and have a great
desir these mani year to come unto you; 15:24 whensoev i take my
journey into spain i will come to you: for i trust to see you in my
journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be
somewhat fill with your compani

15:25 but now i go unto jerusalem to minist unto the saint

15:26 for it hath pleas them of macedonia and achaia to make a
certain contribut for the poor saint which are at jerusalem

15:27 it hath pleas them verily; and their debtor they are for if
the gentil have been made partak of their spiritu thing their
duti is also to minist unto them in carnal thing

15:28 when therefor i have perform thi and have seal to them
thi fruit i will come by you into spain

15:29 and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the
ful of the bless of the gospel of christ

15:30 now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesu christ sake
and for the love of the spirit that ye strive togeth with me in
your prayer to god for me; 15:31 that i may be deliv from them
that do not believ in judaea; and that my servic which i have for
jerusalem may be accept of the saints; 15:32 that i may come unto
you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refresh

15:33 now the god of peac be with you all amen

16:1 i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the
church which is at cenchrea: 16:2 that ye receiv her in the lord as
becometh saint and that ye assist her in whatsoev busi she
hath need of you: for she hath been a succour of mani and of myself
also

the first epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian


1:1 paul call to be an apostl of jesu christ through the will of
god and sosthen our brother 1:2 unto the church of god which is at
corinth to them that are sanctifi in christ jesu call to be
saint with all that in everi place call upon the name of jesu
christ our lord both their and ours: 1:3 grace be unto you and
peac from god our father and from the lord jesu christ

1:4 i thank my god alway on your behalf for the grace of god which
is given you by jesu christ; 1:5 that in everi thing ye are enrich
by him in all utter and in all knowledge; 1:6 even as the
testimoni of christ wa confirm in you: 1:7 so that ye come behind
in no gift; wait for the come of our lord jesu christ: 1:8 who
shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the
day of our lord jesu christ

1:9 god is faith by whom ye were call unto the fellowship of hi
son jesu christ our lord

1:10 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesu
christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no
divis among you; but that ye be perfectli join togeth in the
same mind and in the same judgment

1:11 for it hath been declar unto me of you my brethren by them
which are of the hous of chloe that there are content among you

1:12 now thi i say that everi one of you saith i am of paul; and i
of apollos; and i of cephas; and i of christ

1:13 is christ divided? wa paul crucifi for you? or were ye
baptiz in the name of paul? 1:14 i thank god that i baptiz none
of you but crispu and gaius; 1:15 lest ani should say that i had
baptiz in mine own name

1:16 and i baptiz also the household of stephanas: besid i know
not whether i baptiz ani other

1:17 for christ sent me not to baptiz but to preach the gospel: not
with wisdom of word lest the cross of christ should be made of none
effect

1:18 for the preach of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us which are save it is the power of god

1:19 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
will bring to noth the understand of the prudent

1:20 where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disput of
thi world? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of thi world? 1:21
for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god
it pleas god by the foolish of preach to save them that
believ

1:22 for the jew requir a sign and the greek seek after wisdom:
1:23 but we preach christ crucifi unto the jew a stumblingblock
and unto the greek foolishness; 1:24 but unto them which are call
both jew and greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god

1:25 becaus the foolish of god is wiser than men; and the
weak of god is stronger than men

1:26 for ye see your call brethren how that not mani wise men
after the flesh not mani mighti not mani nobl are called: 1:27 but
god hath chosen the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise;
and god hath chosen the weak thing of the world to confound the
thing which are mighty; 1:28 and base thing of the world and thing
which are despis hath god chosen yea and thing which are not to
bring to nought thing that are: 1:29 that no flesh should glori in
hi presenc

1:30 but of him are ye in christ jesu who of god is made unto us
wisdom and righteous and sanctif and redemption: 1:31
that accord as it is written he that glorieth let him glori in
the lord

2:1 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excel of
speech or of wisdom declar unto you the testimoni of god

2:2 for i determin not to know ani thing among you save jesu
christ and him crucifi

2:3 and i wa with you in weak and in fear and in much
trembl

2:4 and my speech and my preach wa not with entic word of
man wisdom but in demonstr of the spirit and of power: 2:5
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the
power of god

2:6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
wisdom of thi world nor of the princ of thi world that come to
nought: 2:7 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mysteri even the
hidden wisdom which god ordain befor the world unto our glory: 2:8
which none of the princ of thi world knew: for had they known it
they would not have crucifi the lord of glori

2:9 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither
have enter into the heart of man the thing which god hath prepar
for them that love him

2:10 but god hath reveal them unto us by hi spirit: for the spirit
searcheth all thing yea the deep thing of god

2:11 for what man knoweth the thing of a man save the spirit of man
which is in him? even so the thing of god knoweth no man but the
spirit of god

2:12 now we have receiv not the spirit of the world but the spirit
which is of god; that we might know the thing that are freeli given
to us of god

2:13 which thing also we speak not in the word which man wisdom
teacheth but which the holi ghost teacheth; compar spiritu
thing with spiritu

2:14 but the natur man receiveth not the thing of the spirit of
god: for they are foolish unto him: neither can he know them
becaus they are spiritu discern

2:15 but he that is spiritu judgeth all thing yet he himself is
judg of no man

2:16 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct
him? but we have the mind of christ

3:1 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritu but
as unto carnal even as unto babe in christ

3:2 i have fed you with milk and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
not abl to bear it neither yet now are ye abl

3:3 for ye are yet carnal: for wherea there is among you envi and
strife and divis are ye not carnal and walk as men? 3:4 for
while one saith i am of paul; and anoth i am of apollos; are ye
not carnal? 3:5 who then is paul and who is apollo but minist
by whom ye believ even as the lord gave to everi man? 3:6 i have
plant apollo watered; but god gave the increas

3:7 so then neither is he that planteth ani thing neither he that
watereth; but god that giveth the increas

3:8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and everi man
shall receiv hi own reward accord to hi own labour

3:9 for we are labour togeth with god: ye are god husbandri ye
are god build

3:10 accord to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise
masterbuild i have laid the foundat and anoth buildeth
thereon but let everi man take heed how he buildeth thereupon

3:11 for other foundat can no man lay than that is laid which is
jesu christ

3:12 now if ani man build upon thi foundat gold silver preciou
stone wood hay stubble; 3:13 everi man work shall be made
manifest: for the day shall declar it becaus it shall be reveal
by fire; and the fire shall tri everi man work of what sort it is

3:14 if ani man work abid which he hath built thereupon he shall
receiv a reward

3:15 if ani man work shall be burn he shall suffer loss: but he
himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire

3:16 know ye not that ye are the templ of god and that the spirit of
god dwelleth in you? 3:17 if ani man defil the templ of god him
shall god destroy; for the templ of god is holi which templ ye are

3:18 let no man deceiv himself if ani man among you seemeth to be
wise in thi world let him becom a fool that he may be wise

3:19 for the wisdom of thi world is foolish with god for it is
written he taketh the wise in their own crafti

3:20 and again the lord knoweth the thought of the wise that they
are vain

3:21 therefor let no man glori in men for all thing are yours;
3:22 whether paul or apollo or cepha or the world or life or
death or thing present or thing to come; all are yours; 3:23 and
ye are christs; and christ is god

4:1 let a man so account of us as of the minist of christ and
steward of the mysteri of god

4:2 moreov it is requir in steward that a man be found faith

4:3 but with me it is a veri small thing that i should be judg of
you or of man judgment: yea i judg not mine own self

4:4 for i know noth by myself; yet am i not herebi justified: but
he that judgeth me is the lord

4:5 therefor judg noth befor the time until the lord come who
both will bring to light the hidden thing of dark and will make
manifest the counsel of the hearts: and then shall everi man have
prais of god

4:6 and these thing brethren i have in a figur transfer to
myself and to apollo for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to
think of men abov that which is written that no one of you be puf
up for one against anoth

4:7 for who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receiv it whi dost
thou glori as if thou hadst not receiv it? 4:8 now ye are full
now ye are rich ye have reign as king without us: and i would to
god ye did reign that we also might reign with you

4:9 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostl last as it
were appoint to death: for we are made a spectacl unto the world
and to angel and to men

4:10 we are fool for christ sake but ye are wise in christ; we are
weak but ye are strong; ye are honour but we are despis

4:11 even unto thi present hour we both hunger and thirst and are
nake and are buffet and have no certain dwellingplace; 4:12 and
labour work with our own hands: be revil we bless; be
persecut we suffer it: 4:13 be defam we intreat: we are made
as the filth of the world and are the offscour of all thing unto
thi day

4:14 i write not these thing to shame you but as my belov son i
warn you

4:15 for though ye have ten thousand instruct in christ yet have
ye not mani fathers: for in christ jesu i have begotten you through
the gospel

4:16 wherefor i beseech you be ye follow of me

4:17 for thi caus have i sent unto you timotheu who is my belov
son and faith in the lord who shall bring you into remembr of
my way which be in christ as i teach everi where in everi church

4:18 now some are puf up as though i would not come to you

4:19 but i will come to you shortli if the lord will and will know
not the speech of them which are puf up but the power

4:20 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power

4:21 what will ye? shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and
in the spirit of meekness? 5:1 it is report commonli that there is
fornic among you and such fornic as is not so much as name
among the gentil that one should have hi father wife

5:2 and ye are puf up and have not rather mourn that he that
hath done thi deed might be taken away from among you

5:3 for i verili as absent in bodi but present in spirit have
judg alreadi as though i were present concern him that hath so
done thi deed 5:4 in the name of our lord jesu christ when ye are
gather togeth and my spirit with the power of our lord jesu
christ 5:5 to deliv such an one unto satan for the destruct of
the flesh that the spirit may be save in the day of the lord jesu

5:6 your glori is not good know ye not that a littl leaven
leaveneth the whole lump? 5:7 purg out therefor the old leaven
that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleaven for even christ our
passov is sacrif for us: 5:8 therefor let us keep the feast
not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malic and wickedness;
but with the unleaven bread of sincer and truth

5:9 i wrote unto you in an epistl not to compani with fornicators:
5:10 yet not altogeth with the fornic of thi world or with
the covet or extortion or with idolaters; for then must ye
need go out of the world

5:11 but now i have written unto you not to keep compani if ani man
that is call a brother be a fornic or covet or an idolat
or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner; with such an one no not
to eat

5:12 for what have i to do to judg them also that are without? do not
ye judg them that are within? 5:13 but them that are without god
judgeth therefor put away from among yourselv that wick person

6:1 dare ani of you have a matter against anoth go to law befor
the unjust and not befor the saints? 6:2 do ye not know that the
saint shall judg the world? and if the world shall be judg by you
are ye unworthi to judg the smallest matters? 6:3 know ye not that
we shall judg angels? how much more thing that pertain to thi life?
6:4 if then ye have judgment of thing pertain to thi life set
them to judg who are least esteem in the church

6:5 i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man
among you? no not one that shall be abl to judg between hi
brethren? 6:6 but brother goeth to law with brother and that befor
the unbeliev

6:7 now therefor there is utterli a fault among you becaus ye go to
law one with anoth whi do ye not rather take wrong? whi do ye not
rather suffer yourselv to be defrauded? 6:8 nay ye do wrong and
defraud and that your brethren

6:9 know ye not that the unright shall not inherit the kingdom of
god? be not deceived: neither fornic nor idolat nor
adulter nor effemin nor abus of themselv with mankind
6:10 nor thiev nor covet nor drunkard nor revil nor
extortion shall inherit the kingdom of god

6:11 and such were some of you: but ye are wash but ye are
sanctifi but ye are justifi in the name of the lord jesu and by
the spirit of our god

6:12 all thing are law unto me but all thing are not expedient:
all thing are law for me but i will not be brought under the
power of ani

6:13 meat for the belli and the belli for meats: but god shall
destroy both it and them now the bodi is not for fornic but for
the lord; and the lord for the bodi

6:14 and god hath both rais up the lord and will also rais up us
by hi own power

6:15 know ye not that your bodi are the member of christ? shall i
then take the member of christ and make them the member of an
harlot? god forbid

6:16 what? know ye not that he which is join to an harlot is one
body? for two saith he shall be one flesh

6:17 but he that is join unto the lord is one spirit

6:18 flee fornic everi sin that a man doeth is without the body;
but he that committeth fornic sinneth against hi own bodi

6:19 what? know ye not that your bodi is the templ of the holi ghost
which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own? 6:20
for ye are bought with a price: therefor glorifi god in your bodi
and in your spirit which are god

7:1 now concern the thing whereof ye wrote unto me: it is good for
a man not to touch a woman

7:2 nevertheless to avoid fornic let everi man have hi own
wife and let everi woman have her own husband

7:3 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewis
also the wife unto the husband

7:4 the wife hath not power of her own bodi but the husband: and
likewis also the husband hath not power of hi own bodi but the
wife

7:5 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a
time that ye may give yourselv to fast and prayer; and come
togeth again that satan tempt you not for your incontin

7:6 but i speak thi by permiss and not of command

7:7 for i would that all men were even as i myself but everi man hath
hi proper gift of god one after thi manner and anoth after that

7:8 i say therefor to the unmarri and widow it is good for them
if they abid even as i

7:9 but if they cannot contain let them marry: for it is better to
marri than to burn

7:10 and unto the marri i command yet not i but the lord let not
the wife depart from her husband: 7:11 but and if she depart let her
remain unmarri or be reconcil to her husband: and let not the
husband put away hi wife

7:12 but to the rest speak i not the lord: if ani brother hath a wife
that believeth not and she be pleas to dwell with him let him not
put her away

7:13 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he
be pleas to dwell with her let her not leav him

7:14 for the unbeliev husband is sanctifi by the wife and the
unbeliev wife is sanctifi by the husband: els were your children
unclean; but now are they holi

7:15 but if the unbeliev depart let him depart a brother or a
sister is not under bondag in such cases: but god hath call us to
peac

7:16 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thi
husband? or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thi
wife? 7:17 but as god hath distribut to everi man as the lord hath
call everi one so let him walk and so ordain i in all church

7:18 is ani man call be circumcised? let him not becom
uncircumcis is ani call in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcis

7:19 circumcis is noth and uncircumcis is noth but the
keep of the command of god

7:20 let everi man abid in the same call wherein he wa call

7:21 art thou call be a servant? care not for it: but if thou
mayest be made free use it rather

7:22 for he that is call in the lord be a servant is the lord
freeman: likewis also he that is call be free is christ
servant

7:23 ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servant of men

7:24 brethren let everi man wherein he is call therein abid with
god

7:25 now concern virgin i have no command of the lord: yet i
give my judgment as one that hath obtain merci of the lord to be
faith

7:26 i suppos therefor that thi is good for the present distress i
say that it is good for a man so to be

7:27 art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loos art thou
loos from a wife? seek not a wife

7:28 but and if thou marri thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
marri she hath not sin nevertheless such shall have troubl in
the flesh: but i spare you

7:29 but thi i say brethren the time is short: it remaineth that
both they that have wive be as though they had none; 7:30 and they
that weep as though they wept not; and they that rejoic as though
they rejoic not; and they that buy as though they possess not;
7:31 and they that use thi world as not abus it: for the fashion
of thi world passeth away

7:32 but i would have you without care he that is unmarri
careth for the thing that belong to the lord how he may pleas the
lord: 7:33 but he that is marri careth for the thing that are of
the world how he may pleas hi wife

7:34 there is differ also between a wife and a virgin the
unmarri woman careth for the thing of the lord that she may be
holi both in bodi and in spirit: but she that is marri careth for
the thing of the world how she may pleas her husband

7:35 and thi i speak for your own profit; not that i may cast a snare
upon you but for that which is come and that ye may attend upon
the lord without distract

7:36 but if ani man think that he behaveth himself uncom toward hi
virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so requir let
him do what he will he sinneth not: let them marri

7:37 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in hi heart have no
necess but hath power over hi own will and hath so decre in
hi heart that he will keep hi virgin doeth well

7:38 so then he that giveth her in marriag doeth well; but he that
giveth her not in marriag doeth better

7:39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be dead she is at liberti to be marri to whom she
will; onli in the lord

7:40 but she is happier if she so abid after my judgment: and i
think also that i have the spirit of god

8:1 now as touch thing offer unto idol we know that we all
have knowledg knowledg puffeth up but chariti edifieth

8:2 and if ani man think that he knoweth ani thing he knoweth noth
yet as he ought to know

8:3 but if ani man love god the same is known of him

8:4 as concern therefor the eat of those thing that are
offer in sacrific unto idol we know that an idol is noth in
the world and that there is none other god but one

8:5 for though there be that are call god whether in heaven or in
earth (a there be god mani and lord many) 8:6 but to us there is
but one god the father of whom are all thing and we in him; and
one lord jesu christ by whom are all thing and we by him

8:7 howbeit there is not in everi man that knowledge: for some with
conscienc of the idol unto thi hour eat it as a thing offer unto
an idol; and their conscienc be weak is defil

8:8 but meat commendeth us not to god: for neither if we eat are we
the better; neither if we eat not are we the wors

8:9 but take heed lest by ani mean thi liberti of your becom a
stumblingblock to them that are weak

8:10 for if ani man see thee which hast knowledg sit at meat in the
idol templ shall not the conscienc of him which is weak be
embolden to eat those thing which are offer to idols; 8:11 and
through thi knowledg shall the weak brother perish for whom christ
died? 8:12 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their
weak conscienc ye sin against christ

8:13 wherefor if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh
while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend

9:1 am i not an apostle? am i not free? have i not seen jesu christ
our lord? are not ye my work in the lord? 9:2 if i be not an apostl
unto other yet doubtless i am to you: for the seal of mine
apostleship are ye in the lord

9:3 mine answer to them that do examin me is thi 9:4 have we not
power to eat and to drink? 9:5 have we not power to lead about a
sister a wife as well as other apostl and as the brethren of the
lord and cephas? 9:6 or i onli and barnaba have not we power to
forbear working? 9:7 who goeth a warfar ani time at hi own charges?
who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 9:8 say i
these thing as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 9:9 for it
is written in the law of mose thou shalt not muzzl the mouth of the
ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen? 9:10 or
saith he it altogeth for our sakes? for our sake no doubt thi is
written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that
thresheth in hope should be partak of hi hope

9:11 if we have sown unto you spiritu thing is it a great thing if
we shall reap your carnal things? 9:12 if other be partak of thi
power over you are not we rather? nevertheless we have not use thi
power; but suffer all thing lest we should hinder the gospel of
christ

9:13 do ye not know that they which minist about holi thing live of
the thing of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are
partak with the altar? 9:14 even so hath the lord ordain that
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel

9:15 but i have use none of these things: neither have i written
these thing that it should be so done unto me: for it were better
for me to die than that ani man should make my glori void

9:16 for though i preach the gospel i have noth to glori of: for
necess is laid upon me; yea woe is unto me if i preach not the
gospel! 9:17 for if i do thi thing willingli i have a reward: but
if against my will a dispens of the gospel is commit unto me

9:18 what is my reward then? verili that when i preach the gospel i
may make the gospel of christ without charg that i abus not my
power in the gospel

9:19 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant
unto all that i might gain the more

9:20 and unto the jew i becam as a jew that i might gain the jews;
to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain
them that are under the law; 9:21 to them that are without law as
without law (be not without law to god but under the law to
christ) that i might gain them that are without law

9:22 to the weak becam i as weak that i might gain the weak: i am
made all thing to all men that i might by all mean save some

9:23 and thi i do for the gospel sake that i might be partak
thereof with you

9:24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one
receiveth the prize? so run that ye may obtain

9:25 and everi man that striveth for the masteri is temper in all
thing now they do it to obtain a corrupt crown; but we an
incorrupt

9:26 i therefor so run not as uncertainly; so fight i not as one
that beateth the air: 9:27 but i keep under my bodi and bring it into
subjection: lest that by ani mean when i have preach to other i
myself should be a castaway

10:1 moreov brethren i would not that ye should be ignor how
that all our father were under the cloud and all pass through the
sea; 10:2 and were all baptiz unto mose in the cloud and in the
sea; 10:3 and did all eat the same spiritu meat; 10:4 and did all
drink the same spiritu drink: for they drank of that spiritu rock
that follow them: and that rock wa christ

10:5 but with mani of them god wa not well pleased: for they were
overthrown in the wilder

10:6 now these thing were our exampl to the intent we should not
lust after evil thing as they also lust

10:7 neither be ye idolat as were some of them; as it is written
the peopl sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play

10:8 neither let us commit fornic as some of them commit and
fell in one day three and twenti thousand

10:9 neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempt and
were destroy of serpent

10:10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmur and were
destroy of the destroy

10:11 now all these thing happen unto them for ensamples: and they
are written for our admonit upon whom the end of the world are
come

10:12 wherefor let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
fall

10:13 there hath no temptat taken you but such as is common to man:
but god is faith who will not suffer you to be tempt abov that
ye are able; but will with the temptat also make a way to escap
that ye may be abl to bear it

10:14 wherefor my dearli belov flee from idolatri

10:15 i speak as to wise men; judg ye what i say

10:16 the cup of bless which we bless is it not the communion of
the blood of christ? the bread which we break is it not the communion
of the bodi of christ? 10:17 for we be mani are one bread and one
body: for we are all partak of that one bread

10:18 behold israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
sacrific partak of the altar? 10:19 what say i then? that the
idol is ani thing or that which is offer in sacrific to idol is
ani thing? 10:20 but i say that the thing which the gentil
sacrific they sacrific to devil and not to god: and i would not
that ye should have fellowship with devil

10:21 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils: ye
cannot be partak of the lord tabl and of the tabl of devil

10:22 do we provok the lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
10:23 all thing are law for me but all thing are not expedient:
all thing are law for me but all thing edifi not

10:24 let no man seek hi own but everi man anoth wealth

10:25 whatsoev is sold in the shambl that eat ask no question
for conscienc sake: 10:26 for the earth is the lord and the
ful thereof

10:27 if ani of them that believ not bid you to a feast and ye be
dispos to go; whatsoev is set befor you eat ask no question
for conscienc sake

10:28 but if ani man say unto you thi is offer in sacrific unto
idol eat not for hi sake that shew it and for conscienc sake:
for the earth is the lord and the ful thereof: 10:29
conscienc i say not thine own but of the other: for whi is my
liberti judg of anoth man conscience? 10:30 for if i by grace
be a partak whi am i evil spoken of for that for which i give
thanks? 10:31 whether therefor ye eat or drink or whatsoev ye
do do all to the glori of god

10:32 give none offenc neither to the jew nor to the gentil nor
to the church of god: 10:33 even as i pleas all men in all thing
not seek mine own profit but the profit of mani that they may be
save

11:1 be ye follow of me even as i also am of christ

11:2 now i prais you brethren that ye rememb me in all thing
and keep the ordin as i deliv them to you

11:3 but i would have you know that the head of everi man is christ;
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of christ is god

11:4 everi man pray or prophesi have hi head cover
dishonoureth hi head

11:5 but everi woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
uncov dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she
were shaven

11:6 for if the woman be not cover let her also be shorn: but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be cover

11:7 for a man inde ought not to cover hi head forasmuch as he is
the imag and glori of god: but the woman is the glori of the man

11:8 for the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man

11:9 neither wa the man creat for the woman; but the woman for the
man

11:10 for thi caus ought the woman to have power on her head becaus
of the angel

11:11 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the
woman without the man in the lord

11:12 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the
woman; but all thing of god

11:13 judg in yourselves: is it come that a woman pray unto god
uncovered? 11:14 doth not even natur itself teach you that if a
man have long hair it is a shame unto him? 11:15 but if a woman have
long hair it is a glori to her: for her hair is given her for a
cover

11:16 but if ani man seem to be contenti we have no such custom
neither the church of god

11:17 now in thi that i declar unto you i prais you not that ye
come togeth not for the better but for the wors

11:18 for first of all when ye come togeth in the church i hear
that there be divis among you; and i partli believ it

11:19 for there must be also heresi among you that they which are
approv may be made manifest among you

11:20 when ye come togeth therefor into one place thi is not to
eat the lord supper

11:21 for in eat everi one taketh befor other hi own supper: and
one is hungri and anoth is drunken

11:22 what? have ye not hous to eat and to drink in? or despis ye
the church of god and shame them that have not? what shall i say to
you? shall i prais you in this? i prais you not

11:23 for i have receiv of the lord that which also i deliv unto
you that the lord jesu the same night in which he wa betray took
bread: 11:24 and when he had given thank he brake it and said
take eat: thi is my bodi which is broken for you: thi do in
remembr of me

11:25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup
say thi cup is the new testament in my blood: thi do ye as oft
as ye drink it in remembr of me

11:26 for as often as ye eat thi bread and drink thi cup ye do
shew the lord death till he come

11:27 wherefor whosoev shall eat thi bread and drink thi cup of
the lord unworthili shall be guilti of the bodi and blood of the
lord

11:28 but let a man examin himself and so let him eat of that bread
and drink of that cup

11:29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthili eateth and drinketh
damnat to himself not discern the lord bodi

11:30 for thi caus mani are weak and sickli among you and mani
sleep

11:31 for if we would judg ourselv we should not be judg

11:32 but when we are judg we are chasten of the lord that we
should not be condemn with the world

11:33 wherefor my brethren when ye come togeth to eat tarri one
for anoth

11:34 and if ani man hunger let him eat at home; that ye come not
togeth unto condemn and the rest will i set in order when i
come

12:1 now concern spiritu gift brethren i would not have you
ignor

12:2 ye know that ye were gentil carri away unto these dumb
idol even as ye were led

12:3 wherefor i give you to understand that no man speak by the
spirit of god calleth jesu accursed: and that no man can say that
jesu is the lord but by the holi ghost

12:4 now there are divers of gift but the same spirit

12:5 and there are differ of administr but the same lord

12:6 and there are divers of oper but it is the same god
which worketh all in all

12:7 but the manifest of the spirit is given to everi man to
profit withal

12:8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom; to anoth
the word of knowledg by the same spirit; 12:9 to anoth faith by the
same spirit; to anoth the gift of heal by the same spirit; 12:10
to anoth the work of miracles; to anoth prophecy; to anoth
discern of spirits; to anoth diver kind of tongues; to anoth
the interpret of tongues: 12:11 but all these worketh that one
and the selfsam spirit divid to everi man sever as he will

12:12 for as the bodi is one and hath mani member and all the
member of that one bodi be mani are one body: so also is christ

12:13 for by one spirit are we all baptiz into one bodi whether we
be jew or gentil whether we be bond or free; and have been all
made to drink into one spirit

12:14 for the bodi is not one member but mani

12:15 if the foot shall say becaus i am not the hand i am not of
the body; is it therefor not of the body? 12:16 and if the ear shall
say becaus i am not the eye i am not of the body; is it therefor
not of the body? 12:17 if the whole bodi were an eye where were the
hearing? if the whole were hear where were the smelling? 12:18
but now hath god set the member everi one of them in the bodi as it
hath pleas him

12:19 and if they were all one member where were the body? 12:20 but
now are they mani member yet but one bodi

12:21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee:
nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you

12:22 nay much more those member of the bodi which seem to be more
feebl are necessary: 12:23 and those member of the bodi which we
think to be less honour upon these we bestow more abund
honour; and our uncom part have more abund comeli

12:24 for our come part have no need: but god hath temper the
bodi togeth have given more abund honour to that part which
lack

12:25 that there should be no schism in the body; but that the member
should have the same care one for anoth

12:26 and whether one member suffer all the member suffer with it;
or one member be honour all the member rejoic with it

12:27 now ye are the bodi of christ and member in particular

12:28 and god hath set some in the church first apostl secondarili
prophet thirdli teacher after that miracl then gift of
heal help govern divers of tongu

12:29 are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
worker of miracles? 12:30 have all the gift of healing? do all
speak with tongues? do all interpret? 12:31 but covet earnestli the
best gifts: and yet shew i unto you a more excel way

13:1 though i speak with the tongu of men and of angel and have
not chariti i am becom as sound brass or a tinkl cymbal

13:2 and though i have the gift of propheci and understand all
mysteri and all knowledge; and though i have all faith so that i
could remov mountain and have not chariti i am noth

13:3 and though i bestow all my good to feed the poor and though i
give my bodi to be burn and have not chariti it profiteth me
noth

13:4 chariti suffereth long and is kind; chariti envieth not; chariti
vaunteth not itself is not puf up 13:5 doth not behav itself
unseemli seeketh not her own is not easili provok thinketh no
evil; 13:6 rejoiceth not in iniqu but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7
beareth all thing believeth all thing hopeth all thing endureth
all thing

13:8 chariti never faileth: but whether there be propheci they
shall fail; whether there be tongu they shall cease; whether there
be knowledg it shall vanish away

13:9 for we know in part and we prophesi in part

13:10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in
part shall be done away

13:11 when i wa a child i spake as a child i understood as a child
i thought as a child: but when i becam a man i put away childish
thing

13:12 for now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face:
now i know in part; but then shall i know even as also i am known

13:13 and now abideth faith hope chariti these three; but the
greatest of these is chariti

14:1 follow after chariti and desir spiritu gift but rather that
ye may prophesi

14:2 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongu speaketh not unto men
but unto god: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he
speaketh mysteri

14:3 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edif and
exhort and comfort

14:4 he that speaketh in an unknown tongu edifieth himself; but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church

14:5 i would that ye all spake with tongu but rather that ye
prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
with tongu except he interpret that the church may receiv
edifi

14:6 now brethren if i come unto you speak with tongu what
shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revel
or by knowledg or by prophesi or by doctrine? 14:7 and even
thing without life give sound whether pipe or harp except they
give a distinct in the sound how shall it be known what is pipe
or harped? 14:8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall
prepar himself to the battle? 14:9 so likewis ye except ye utter
by the tongu word easi to be understood how shall it be known what
is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air

14:10 there are it may be so mani kind of voic in the world and
none of them is without signif

14:11 therefor if i know not the mean of the voic i shall be
unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me

14:12 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealou of spiritu gift seek
that ye may excel to the edifi of the church

14:13 wherefor let him that speaketh in an unknown tongu pray that
he may interpret

14:14 for if i pray in an unknown tongu my spirit prayeth but my
understand is unfruit

14:15 what is it then? i will pray with the spirit and i will pray
with the understand also: i will sing with the spirit and i will
sing with the understand also

14:16 els when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearn say amen at thi give of thank
see he understandeth not what thou sayest? 14:17 for thou verili
givest thank well but the other is not edifi

14:18 i thank my god i speak with tongu more than ye all: 14:19 yet
in the church i had rather speak five word with my understand
that by my voic i might teach other also than ten thousand word in
an unknown tongu

14:20 brethren be not children in understanding: howbeit in malic be
ye children but in understand be men

14:21 in the law it is written with men of other tongu and other
lip will i speak unto thi people; and yet for all that will they not
hear me saith the lord

14:22 wherefor tongu are for a sign not to them that believ but
to them that believ not: but prophesi serveth not for them that
believ not but for them which believ

14:23 if therefor the whole church be come togeth into one place
and all speak with tongu and there come in those that are
unlearn or unbeliev will they not say that ye are mad? 14:24
but if all prophesi and there come in one that believeth not or one
unlearn he is convinc of all he is judg of all: 14:25 and thu
are the secret of hi heart made manifest; and so fall down on hi
face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth

14:26 how is it then brethren? when ye come togeth everi one of
you hath a psalm hath a doctrin hath a tongu hath a revel
hath an interpret let all thing be done unto edifi

14:27 if ani man speak in an unknown tongu let it be by two or at
the most by three and that by course; and let one interpret

14:28 but if there be no interpret let him keep silenc in the
church; and let him speak to himself and to god

14:29 let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judg

14:30 if ani thing be reveal to anoth that sitteth by let the
first hold hi peac

14:31 for ye may all prophesi one by one that all may learn and all
may be comfort

14:32 and the spirit of the prophet are subject to the prophet

14:33 for god is not the author of confus but of peac as in all
church of the saint

14:34 let your women keep silenc in the churches: for it is not
permit unto them to speak; but they are command to be under
obedi as also saith the law

14:35 and if they will learn ani thing let them ask their husband at
home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church

14:36 what? came the word of god out from you? or came it unto you
only? 14:37 if ani man think himself to be a prophet or spiritu
let him acknowledg that the thing that i write unto you are the
command of the lord

14:38 but if ani man be ignor let him be ignor

14:39 wherefor brethren covet to prophesi and forbid not to speak
with tongu

14:40 let all thing be done decent and in order

15:1 moreov brethren i declar unto you the gospel which i
preach unto you which also ye have receiv and wherein ye stand;
15:2 by which also ye are save if ye keep in memori what i preach
unto you unless ye have believ in vain

15:3 for i deliv unto you first of all that which i also receiv
how that christ die for our sin accord to the scriptures; 15:4
and that he wa buri and that he rose again the third day accord
to the scriptures: 15:5 and that he wa seen of cepha then of the
twelve: 15:6 after that he wa seen of abov five hundr brethren at
once; of whom the greater part remain unto thi present but some are
fallen asleep

15:7 after that he wa seen of james; then of all the apostl

15:8 and last of all he wa seen of me also as of one born out of due
time

15:9 for i am the least of the apostl that am not meet to be call
an apostl becaus i persecut the church of god

15:10 but by the grace of god i am what i am: and hi grace which wa
bestow upon me wa not in vain; but i labour more abundantli than
they all: yet not i but the grace of god which wa with me

15:11 therefor whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye
believ

15:12 now if christ be preach that he rose from the dead how say
some among you that there is no resurrect of the dead? 15:13 but
if there be no resurrect of the dead then is christ not risen:
15:14 and if christ be not risen then is our preach vain and your
faith is also vain

15:15 yea and we are found fals wit of god; becaus we have
testifi of god that he rais up christ: whom he rais not up if
so be that the dead rise not

15:16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised: 15:17 and
if christ be not rais your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sin

15:18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perish

15:19 if in thi life onli we have hope in christ we are of all men
most miser

15:20 but now is christ risen from the dead and becom the
firstfruit of them that slept

15:21 for sinc by man came death by man came also the resurrect
of the dead

15:22 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made
aliv

15:23 but everi man in hi own order: christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are christ at hi come

15:24 then cometh the end when he shall have deliv up the kingdom
to god even the father; when he shall have put down all rule and all
author and power

15:25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemi under hi feet

15:26 the last enemi that shall be destroy is death

15:27 for he hath put all thing under hi feet but when he saith all
thing are put under him it is manifest that he is except which
did put all thing under him

15:28 and when all thing shall be subdu unto him then shall the
son also himself be subject unto him that put all thing under him
that god may be all in all

15:29 els what shall they do which are baptiz for the dead if the
dead rise not at all? whi are they then baptiz for the dead? 15:30
and whi stand we in jeopardi everi hour? 15:31 i protest by your
rejoic which i have in christ jesu our lord i die daili

15:32 if after the manner of men i have fought with beast at ephesu
what advantageth it me if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink;
for to morrow we die

15:33 be not deceived: evil commun corrupt good manner

15:34 awak to righteous and sin not; for some have not the
knowledg of god: i speak thi to your shame

15:35 but some man will say how are the dead rais up? and with what
bodi do they come? 15:36 thou fool that which thou sowest is not
quicken except it die: 15:37 and that which thou sowest thou
sowest not that bodi that shall be but bare grain it may chanc of
wheat or of some other grain: 15:38 but god giveth it a bodi as it
hath pleas him and to everi seed hi own bodi

15:39 all flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh
of men anoth flesh of beast anoth of fish and anoth of
bird

15:40 there are also celesti bodi and bodi terrestrial: but the
glori of the celesti is one and the glori of the terrestri is
anoth

15:41 there is one glori of the sun and anoth glori of the moon
and anoth glori of the stars: for one star differeth from anoth
star in glori

15:42 so also is the resurrect of the dead it is sown in
corruption; it is rais in incorruption: 15:43 it is sown in
dishonour; it is rais in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is rais
in power: 15:44 it is sown a natur body; it is rais a spiritu
bodi there is a natur bodi and there is a spiritu bodi

15:45 and so it is written the first man adam wa made a live soul;
the last adam wa made a quicken spirit

15:46 howbeit that wa not first which is spiritu but that which is
natural; and afterward that which is spiritu

15:47 the first man is of the earth earthy; the second man is the
lord from heaven

15:48 as is the earthi such are they also that are earthy: and as is
the heavenli such are they also that are heavenli

15:49 and as we have born the imag of the earthi we shall also bear
the imag of the heavenli

15:50 now thi i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of god; neither doth corrupt inherit incorrupt

15:51 behold i shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep but we
shall all be chang 15:52 in a moment in the twinkl of an eye
at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be
rais incorrupt and we shall be chang

15:53 for thi corrupt must put on incorrupt and thi mortal
must put on immort

15:54 so when thi corrupt shall have put on incorrupt and
thi mortal shall have put on immort then shall be brought to
pass the say that is written death is swallow up in victori

15:55 o death where is thi sting? o grave where is thi victory?
15:56 the sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law

15:57 but thank be to god which giveth us the victori through our
lord jesu christ

15:58 therefor my belov brethren be ye stedfast unmov
alway abound in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the lord

16:1 now concern the collect for the saint as i have given
order to the church of galatia even so do ye

16:2 upon the first day of the week let everi one of you lay by him in
store as god hath prosper him that there be no gather when i
come

16:3 and when i come whomsoev ye shall approv by your letter
them will i send to bring your liber unto jerusalem

16:4 and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me

16:5 now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia:
for i do pass through macedonia

16:6 and it may be that i will abid yea and winter with you that
ye may bring me on my journey whithersoev i go

16:7 for i will not see you now by the way; but i trust to tarri a
while with you if the lord permit

16:8 but i will tarri at ephesu until pentecost

16:9 for a great door and effectu is open unto me and there are
mani adversari

16:10 now if timotheu come see that he may be with you without fear:
for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do

16:11 let no man therefor despis him: but conduct him forth in
peac that he may come unto me: for i look for him with the brethren

16:12 as touch our brother apollo i greatli desir him to come
unto you with the brethren: but hi will wa not at all to come at
thi time; but he will come when he shall have conveni time

16:13 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong

16:14 let all your thing be done with chariti

16:15 i beseech you brethren (ye know the hous of stephana that
it is the firstfruit of achaia and that they have addict
themselv to the ministri of the saints) 16:16 that ye submit
yourselv unto such and to everi one that helpeth with us and
laboureth

16:17 i am glad of the come of stephana and fortunatu and
achaicus: for that which wa lack on your part they have suppli

16:18 for they have refresh my spirit and yours: therefor
acknowledg ye them that are such

16:19 the church of asia salut you aquila and priscilla salut you
much in the lord with the church that is in their hous

16:20 all the brethren greet you greet ye one anoth with
an holi kiss

16:21 the salut of me paul with mine own hand

16:22 if ani man love not the lord jesu christ let him be
anathema maranatha

16:23 the grace of our lord jesu christ be with you

16:24 my love be with you all in christ jesu amen



the second epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian


1:1 paul an apostl of jesu christ by the will of god and timothi
our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the
saint which are in all achaia: 1:2 grace be to you and peac from god
our father and from the lord jesu christ

1:3 bless be god even the father of our lord jesu christ the
father of merci and the god of all comfort; 1:4 who comforteth us
in all our tribul that we may be abl to comfort them which are
in ani troubl by the comfort wherewith we ourselv are comfort of
god

1:5 for as the suffer of christ abound in us so our consol
also aboundeth by christ

1:6 and whether we be afflict it is for your consol and
salvat which is effectu in the endur of the same suffer
which we also suffer: or whether we be comfort it is for your
consol and salvat

1:7 and our hope of you is stedfast know that as ye are partak
of the suffer so shall ye be also of the consol

1:8 for we would not brethren have you ignor of our troubl which
came to us in asia that we were press out of measur abov
strength insomuch that we despair even of life: 1:9 but we had the
sentenc of death in ourselv that we should not trust in ourselv
but in god which raiseth the dead: 1:10 who deliv us from so great
a death and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliv
us; 1:11 ye also help togeth by prayer for us that for the gift
bestow upon us by the mean of mani person thank may be given by
mani on our behalf

1:12 for our rejoic is thi the testimoni of our conscienc that
in simplic and godli sincer not with fleshli wisdom but by the
grace of god we have had our convers in the world and more
abundantli to you-ward

1:13 for we write none other thing unto you than what ye read or
acknowledge; and i trust ye shall acknowledg even to the end; 1:14 as
also ye have acknowledg us in part that we are your rejoic even
as ye also are our in the day of the lord jesu

1:15 and in thi confid i wa mind to come unto you befor that
ye might have a second benefit; 1:16 and to pass by you into
macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to
be brought on my way toward judaea

1:17 when i therefor wa thu mind did i use lightness? or the
thing that i purpos do i purpos accord to the flesh that with
me there should be yea yea and nay nay? 1:18 but as god is true our
word toward you wa not yea and nay

1:19 for the son of god jesu christ who wa preach among you by
us even by me and silvanu and timotheu wa not yea and nay but in
him wa yea

1:20 for all the promis of god in him are yea and in him amen unto
the glori of god by us

1:21 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anoint
us is god; 1:22 who hath also seal us and given the earnest of the
spirit in our heart

1:23 moreov i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you
i came not as yet unto corinth

1:24 not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helper of
your joy: for by faith ye stand

2:1 but i determin thi with myself that i would not come again to
you in heavi

2:2 for if i make you sorri who is he then that maketh me glad but
the same which is made sorri by me? 2:3 and i wrote thi same unto
you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought
to rejoice; have confid in you all that my joy is the joy of
you all

2:4 for out of much afflict and anguish of heart i wrote unto you
with mani tears; not that ye should be griev but that ye might know
the love which i have more abundantli unto you

2:5 but if ani have caus grief he hath not griev me but in part:
that i may not overcharg you all

2:6 suffici to such a man is thi punish which wa inflict
of mani

2:7 so that contrariwis ye ought rather to forgiv him and comfort
him lest perhap such a one should be swallow up with overmuch
sorrow

2:8 wherefor i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
him

2:9 for to thi end also did i write that i might know the proof of
you whether ye be obedi in all thing

2:10 to whom ye forgiv ani thing i forgiv also: for if i forgav
ani thing to whom i forgav it for your sake forgav i it in the
person of christ; 2:11 lest satan should get an advantag of us: for
we are not ignor of hi devic

2:12 furthermor when i came to troa to preach christ gospel and
a door wa open unto me of the lord 2:13 i had no rest in my
spirit becaus i found not titu my brother: but take my leav of
them i went from thenc into macedonia

2:14 now thank be unto god which alway causeth us to triumph in
christ and maketh manifest the savour of hi knowledg by us in everi
place

2:15 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are
save and in them that perish: 2:16 to the one we are the savour of
death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life and
who is suffici for these things? 2:17 for we are not as mani
which corrupt the word of god: but as of sincer but as of god in
the sight of god speak we in christ

3:1 do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we as some
other epistl of commend to you or letter of commend
from you? 3:2 ye are our epistl written in our heart known and
read of all men: 3:3 forasmuch as ye are manifestli declar to be the
epistl of christ minist by us written not with ink but with the
spirit of the live god; not in tabl of stone but in fleshi tabl
of the heart

3:4 and such trust have we through christ to god-ward: 3:5 not that we
are suffici of ourselv to think ani thing as of ourselves; but
our suffici is of god; 3:6 who also hath made us abl minist of
the new testament; not of the letter but of the spirit: for the
letter killeth but the spirit giveth life

3:7 but if the ministr of death written and engraven in stone
wa gloriou so that the children of israel could not stedfastli
behold the face of mose for the glori of hi countenance; which glori
wa to be done away: 3:8 how shall not the ministr of the spirit
be rather glorious? 3:9 for if the ministr of condemn be
glori much more doth the ministr of righteous exceed in
glori

3:10 for even that which wa made gloriou had no glori in thi
respect by reason of the glori that excelleth

3:11 for if that which is done away wa gloriou much more that which
remaineth is gloriou

3:12 see then that we have such hope we use great plain of
speech: 3:13 and not as mose which put a vail over hi face that
the children of israel could not stedfastli look to the end of that
which is abolished: 3:14 but their mind were blinded: for until thi
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the read of the old
testament; which vail is done away in christ

3:15 but even unto thi day when mose is read the vail is upon
their heart

3:16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be
taken away

3:17 now the lord is that spirit: and where the spirit of the lord is
there is liberti

3:18 but we all with open face behold as in a glass the glori of
the lord are chang into the same imag from glori to glori even as
by the spirit of the lord

4:1 therefor see we have thi ministri as we have receiv merci
we faint not; 4:2 but have renounc the hidden thing of dishonesti
not walk in crafti nor handl the word of god deceitfully;
but by manifest of the truth commend ourselv to everi man
conscienc in the sight of god

4:3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 in
whom the god of thi world hath blind the mind of them which
believ not lest the light of the gloriou gospel of christ who is
the imag of god should shine unto them

4:5 for we preach not ourselv but christ jesu the lord; and
ourselv your servant for jesu sake

4:6 for god who command the light to shine out of dark hath
shine in our heart to give the light of the knowledg of the glori
of god in the face of jesu christ

4:7 but we have thi treasur in earthen vessel that the excel
of the power may be of god and not of us

4:8 we are troubl on everi side yet not distressed; we are
perplex but not in despair; 4:9 persecut but not forsaken; cast
down but not destroyed; 4:10 alway bear about in the bodi the
die of the lord jesu that the life also of jesu might be made
manifest in our bodi

4:11 for we which live are alway deliv unto death for jesu sake
that the life also of jesu might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh

4:12 so then death worketh in us but life in you

4:13 we have the same spirit of faith accord as it is written i
believ and therefor have i spoken; we also believ and therefor
speak; 4:14 know that he which rais up the lord jesu shall rais
up us also by jesu and shall present us with you

4:15 for all thing are for your sake that the abund grace might
through the thanksgiv of mani redound to the glori of god

4:16 for which caus we faint not; but though our outward man perish
yet the inward man is renew day by day

4:17 for our light afflict which is but for a moment worketh for
us a far more exceed and etern weight of glory; 4:18 while we
look not at the thing which are seen but at the thing which are not
seen: for the thing which are seen are temporal; but the thing which
are not seen are etern

5:1 for we know that if our earthli hous of thi tabernacl were
dissolv we have a build of god an hous not made with hand
etern in the heaven

5:2 for in thi we groan earnestli desir to be cloth upon with
our hous which is from heaven: 5:3 if so be that be cloth we
shall not be found nake

5:4 for we that are in thi tabernacl do groan be burdened: not
for that we would be uncloth but cloth upon that mortal might
be swallow up of life

5:5 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsam thing is god who
also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit

5:6 therefor we are alway confid know that whilst we are at
home in the bodi we are absent from the lord: 5:7 (for we walk by
faith not by sight:) 5:8 we are confid i say and will rather
to be absent from the bodi and to be present with the lord

5:9 wherefor we labour that whether present or absent we may be
accept of him

5:10 for we must all appear befor the judgment seat of christ; that
everi one may receiv the thing done in hi bodi accord to that
he hath done whether it be good or bad

5:11 know therefor the terror of the lord we persuad men; but we
are made manifest unto god; and i trust also are made manifest in your
conscienc

5:12 for we commend not ourselv again unto you but give you
occas to glori on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer
them which glori in appear and not in heart

5:13 for whether we be besid ourselv it is to god: or whether we
be sober it is for your caus

5:14 for the love of christ constraineth us; becaus we thu judg
that if one die for all then were all dead: 5:15 and that he die
for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselv but unto him which die for them and rose again

5:16 wherefor henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea though
we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
no more

5:17 therefor if ani man be in christ he is a new creature: old
thing are pass away; behold all thing are becom new

5:18 and all thing are of god who hath reconcil us to himself by
jesu christ and hath given to us the ministri of reconciliation;
5:19 to wit that god wa in christ reconcil the world unto
himself not imput their trespass unto them; and hath commit
unto us the word of reconcili

5:20 now then we are ambassador for christ as though god did beseech
you by us: we pray you in christ stead be ye reconcil to god

5:21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteous of god in him

6:1 we then as worker togeth with him beseech you also that ye
receiv not the grace of god in vain

6:2 (for he saith i have heard thee in a time accept and in the
day of salvat have i succour thee: behold now is the accept
time; behold now is the day of salvation) 6:3 give no offenc in
ani thing that the ministri be not blamed: 6:4 but in all thing
approv ourselv as the minist of god in much patienc in
afflict in necess in distress 6:5 in stripe in
imprison in tumult in labour in watch in fastings; 6:6
by pure by knowledg by longsuff by kind by the holi
ghost by love unfeign 6:7 by the word of truth by the power of
god by the armour of righteous on the right hand and on the left
6:8 by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report: as
deceiv and yet true; 6:9 as unknown and yet well known; as die
and behold we live; as chasten and not killed; 6:10 as sorrow
yet alway rejoicing; as poor yet make mani rich; as have noth
and yet possess all thing

6:11 o ye corinthian our mouth is open unto you our heart is
enlarg

6:12 ye are not straiten in us but ye are straiten in your own
bowel

6:13 now for a recomp in the same (i speak as unto my children)
be ye also enlarg

6:14 be ye not unequ yoke togeth with unbelievers: for what
fellowship hath righteous with unrighteousness? and what communion
hath light with darkness? 6:15 and what concord hath christ with
belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 6:16 and
what agreement hath the templ of god with idols? for ye are the
templ of the live god; as god hath said i will dwell in them and
walk in them; and i will be their god and they shall be my peopl

6:17 wherefor come out from among them and be ye separ saith the
lord and touch not the unclean thing; and i will receiv you

6:18 and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my son and
daughter saith the lord almighti

7:1 have therefor these promis dearli belov let us cleans
ourselv from all filthi of the flesh and spirit perfect
holi in the fear of god

7:2 receiv us; we have wrong no man we have corrupt no man we
have defraud no man

7:3 i speak not thi to condemn you: for i have said befor that ye
are in our heart to die and live with you

7:4 great is my bold of speech toward you great is my glori of
you: i am fill with comfort i am exceed joy in all our
tribul

7:5 for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but
we were troubl on everi side; without were fight within were
fear

7:6 nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down
comfort us by the come of titus; 7:7 and not by hi come onli
but by the consol wherewith he wa comfort in you when he told
us your earnest desir your mourn your fervent mind toward me; so
that i rejoic the more

7:8 for though i made you sorri with a letter i do not repent though
i did repent: for i perceiv that the same epistl hath made you
sorri though it were but for a season

7:9 now i rejoic not that ye were made sorri but that ye sorrow
to repentance: for ye were made sorri after a godli manner that ye
might receiv damag by us in noth

7:10 for godli sorrow worketh repent to salvat not to be
repent of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death

7:11 for behold thi selfsam thing that ye sorrow after a godli
sort what care it wrought in you yea what clear of
yourselv yea what indign yea what fear yea what vehement
desir yea what zeal yea what revenge! in all thing ye have
approv yourselv to be clear in thi matter

7:12 wherefor though i wrote unto you i did it not for hi caus
that had done the wrong nor for hi caus that suffer wrong but
that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you

7:13 therefor we were comfort in your comfort: yea and exceedingli
the more joy we for the joy of titu becaus hi spirit wa
refresh by you all

7:14 for if i have boast ani thing to him of you i am not ashamed;
but as we spake all thing to you in truth even so our boast
which i made befor titu is found a truth

7:15 and hi inward affect is more abund toward you whilst he
remembereth the obedi of you all how with fear and trembl ye
receiv him

7:16 i rejoic therefor that i have confid in you in all thing

8:1 moreov brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestow
on the church of macedonia; 8:2 how that in a great trial of
afflict the abund of their joy and their deep poverti abound
unto the rich of their liber

8:3 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power
they were will of themselves; 8:4 pray us with much intreati
that we would receiv the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the
minist to the saint

8:5 and thi they did not as we hope but first gave their own
selv to the lord and unto us by the will of god

8:6 insomuch that we desir titu that as he had begun so he would
also finish in you the same grace also

8:7 therefor as ye abound in everi thing in faith and utter
and knowledg and in all dilig and in your love to us see that
ye abound in thi grace also

8:8 i speak not by command but by occas of the forward of
other and to prove the sincer of your love

8:9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesu christ that though he
wa rich yet for your sake he becam poor that ye through hi
poverti might be rich

8:10 and herein i give my advice: for thi is expedi for you who
have begun befor not onli to do but also to be forward a year ago

8:11 now therefor perform the do of it; that as there wa a
readi to will so there may be a perform also out of that
which ye have

8:12 for if there be first a will mind it is accept accord to
that a man hath and not accord to that he hath not

8:13 for i mean not that other men be eas and ye burdened: 8:14 but
by an equal that now at thi time your abund may be a suppli
for their want that their abund also may be a suppli for your
want: that there may be equality: 8:15 as it is written he that had
gather much had noth over; and he that had gather littl had no
lack

8:16 but thank be to god which put the same earnest care into the
heart of titu for you

8:17 for inde he accept the exhortation; but be more forward
of hi own accord he went unto you

8:18 and we have sent with him the brother whose prais is in the
gospel throughout all the churches; 8:19 and not that onli but who
wa also chosen of the church to travel with us with thi grace
which is administ by us to the glori of the same lord and
declar of your readi mind: 8:20 avoid thi that no man should
blame us in thi abund which is administ by us: 8:21 provid
for honest thing not onli in the sight of the lord but also in the
sight of men

8:22 and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentim
prove dilig in mani thing but now much more dilig upon the
great confid which i have in you

8:23 whether ani do enquir of titu he is my partner and
fellowhelp concern you: or our brethren be enquir of they are
the messeng of the church and the glori of christ

8:24 wherefor shew ye to them and befor the church the proof of
your love and of our boast on your behalf

9:1 for as touch the minist to the saint it is superflu
for me to write to you: 9:2 for i know the forward of your mind
for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia wa readi a
year ago; and your zeal hath provok veri mani

9:3 yet have i sent the brethren lest our boast of you should be
in vain in thi behalf; that as i said ye may be ready: 9:4 lest
hapli if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepar we
(that we say not ye) should be asham in thi same confid
boast

9:5 therefor i thought it necessari to exhort the brethren that they
would go befor unto you and make up beforehand your bounti whereof
ye had notic befor that the same might be readi as a matter of
bounti and not as of covet

9:6 but thi i say he which soweth sparingli shall reap also
sparingly; and he which soweth bounti shall reap also
bounti

9:7 everi man accord as he purposeth in hi heart so let him give;
not grudgingli or of necessity: for god loveth a cheer giver

9:8 and god is abl to make all grace abound toward you; that ye
alway have all suffici in all thing may abound to everi good
work: 9:9 (a it is written he hath dispers abroad; he hath given
to the poor: hi righteous remaineth for ever

9:10 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minist bread for
your food and multipli your seed sown and increas the fruit of
your righteousness;) 9:11 be enrich in everi thing to all
bounti which causeth through us thanksgiv to god

9:12 for the administr of thi servic not onli supplieth the
want of the saint but is abund also by mani thanksgiv unto
god; 9:13 while by the experi of thi ministr they glorifi
god for your profess subject unto the gospel of christ and for
your liber distribut unto them and unto all men; 9:14 and by
their prayer for you which long after you for the exceed grace of
god in you

9:15 thank be unto god for hi unspeak gift

10:1 now i paul myself beseech you by the meek and gentl of
christ who in presenc am base among you but be absent am bold
toward you: 10:2 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am
present with that confid wherewith i think to be bold against
some which think of us as if we walk accord to the flesh

10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh:
10:4 (for the weapon of our warfar are not carnal but mighti
through god to the pull down of strong holds;) 10:5 cast down
imagin and everi high thing that exalteth itself against the
knowledg of god and bring into captiv everi thought to the
obedi of christ; 10:6 and have in a readi to reveng all
disobedi when your obedi is fulfil

10:7 do ye look on thing after the outward appearance? if ani man
trust to himself that he is christ let him of himself think thi
again that as he is christ even so are we christ

10:8 for though i should boast somewhat more of our author which
the lord hath given us for edif and not for your destruct
i should not be ashamed: 10:9 that i may not seem as if i would
terrifi you by letter

10:10 for hi letter say they are weighti and powerful; but hi
bodili presenc is weak and hi speech contempt

10:11 let such an one think thi that such as we are in word by
letter when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are
present

10:12 for we dare not make ourselv of the number or compar
ourselv with some that commend themselves: but they measur
themselv by themselv and compar themselv among themselv
are not wise

10:13 but we will not boast of thing without our measur but
accord to the measur of the rule which god hath distribut to us
a measur to reach even unto you

10:14 for we stretch not ourselv beyond our measur as though we
reach not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
preach the gospel of christ: 10:15 not boast of thing without
our measur that is of other men labours; but have hope when
your faith is increas that we shall be enlarg by you accord to
our rule abundantli 10:16 to preach the gospel in the region beyond
you and not to boast in anoth man line of thing made readi to
our hand

10:17 but he that glorieth let him glori in the lord

10:18 for not he that commendeth himself is approv but whom the
lord commendeth

11:1 would to god ye could bear with me a littl in my folly: and
inde bear with me

11:2 for i am jealou over you with godli jealousy: for i have
espous you to one husband that i may present you as a chast virgin
to christ

11:3 but i fear lest by ani mean as the serpent beguil eve
through hi subtilti so your mind should be corrupt from the
simplic that is in christ

11:4 for if he that cometh preacheth anoth jesu whom we have not
preach or if ye receiv anoth spirit which ye have not receiv
or anoth gospel which ye have not accept ye might well bear with
him

11:5 for i suppos i wa not a whit behind the veri chiefest apostl

11:6 but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge; but we have
been throughli made manifest among you in all thing

11:7 have i commit an offenc in abas myself that ye might be
exalt becaus i have preach to you the gospel of god freely?
11:8 i rob other church take wage of them to do you servic

11:9 and when i wa present with you and want i wa chargeabl to
no man: for that which wa lack to me the brethren which came from
macedonia supplied: and in all thing i have kept myself from be
burdensom unto you and so will i keep myself

11:10 as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of thi
boast in the region of achaia

11:11 wherefore? becaus i love you not? god knoweth

11:12 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occas from
them which desir occasion; that wherein they glori they may be found
even as we

11:13 for such are fals apostl deceit worker transform
themselv into the apostl of christ

11:14 and no marvel; for satan himself is transform into an angel of
light

11:15 therefor it is no great thing if hi minist also be
transform as the minist of righteousness; whose end shall be
accord to their work

11:16 i say again let no man think me a fool; if otherwis yet as a
fool receiv me that i may boast myself a littl

11:17 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it
were foolishli in thi confid of boast

11:18 see that mani glori after the flesh i will glori also

11:19 for ye suffer fool gladli see ye yourselv are wise

11:20 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondag if a man devour
you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you
on the face

11:21 i speak as concern reproach as though we had been weak
howbeit whereinsoev ani is bold (i speak foolishly) i am bold
also

11:22 are they hebrews? so am i are they israelites? so am i are
they the seed of abraham? so am i

11:23 are they minist of christ? (i speak as a fool) i am more; in
labour more abund in stripe abov measur in prison more
frequent in death oft

11:24 of the jew five time receiv i forti stripe save one

11:25 thrice wa i beaten with rod onc wa i stone thrice i
suffer shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep; 11:26
in journey often in peril of water in peril of robber in
peril by mine own countrymen in peril by the heathen in peril in
the citi in peril in the wilder in peril in the sea in peril
among fals brethren; 11:27 in weari and pain in watch
often in hunger and thirst in fast often in cold and naked

11:28 besid those thing that are without that which cometh upon me
daili the care of all the church

11:29 who is weak and i am not weak? who is offend and i burn not?
11:30 if i must need glori i will glori of the thing which concern
mine infirm

11:31 the god and father of our lord jesu christ which is bless
for evermor knoweth that i lie not

11:32 in damascu the governor under areta the king kept the citi of
the damascen with a garrison desir to apprehend me: 11:33 and
through a window in a basket wa i let down by the wall and escap
hi hand

12:1 it is not expedi for me doubtless to glori i will come to
vision and revel of the lord

12:2 i knew a man in christ abov fourteen year ago (whether in the
bodi i cannot tell; or whether out of the bodi i cannot tell: god
knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven

12:3 and i knew such a man (whether in the bodi or out of the bodi
i cannot tell: god knoweth;) 12:4 how that he wa caught up into
paradis and heard unspeak word which it is not law for a
man to utter

12:5 of such an one will i glory: yet of myself i will not glori but
in mine infirm

12:6 for though i would desir to glori i shall not be a fool; for i
will say the truth: but now i forbear lest ani man should think of me
abov that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me

12:7 and lest i should be exalt abov measur through the abund
of the revel there wa given to me a thorn in the flesh the
messeng of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalt abov
measur

12:8 for thi thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart
from me

12:9 and he said unto me my grace is suffici for thee: for my
strength is made perfect in weak most gladli therefor will i
rather glori in my infirm that the power of christ may rest upon
me

12:10 therefor i take pleasur in infirm in reproach in
necess in persecut in distress for christ sake: for
when i am weak then am i strong

12:11 i am becom a fool in glorying; ye have compel me: for i
ought to have been commend of you: for in noth am i behind the
veri chiefest apostl though i be noth

12:12 truli the sign of an apostl were wrought among you in all
patienc in sign and wonder and mighti deed

12:13 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other church
except it be that i myself wa not burdensom to you? forgiv me thi
wrong

12:14 behold the third time i am readi to come to you; and i will not
be burdensom to you: for i seek not your but you: for the children
ought not to lay up for the parent but the parent for the children

12:15 and i will veri gladli spend and be spent for you; though the
more abundantli i love you the less i be love

12:16 but be it so i did not burden you: nevertheless be crafti
i caught you with guil

12:17 did i make a gain of you by ani of them whom i sent unto you?
12:18 i desir titu and with him i sent a brother did titu make a
gain of you? walk we not in the same spirit? walk we not in the
same steps? 12:19 again think ye that we excus ourselv unto you?
we speak befor god in christ: but we do all thing dearli belov
for your edifi

12:20 for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i
would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest
there be debat envi wrath strife backbit whisper
swell tumults: 12:21 and lest when i come again my god will
humbl me among you and that i shall bewail mani which have sin
alreadi and have not repent of the unclean and fornic and
lascivi which they have commit

13:1 thi is the third time i am come to you in the mouth of two or
three wit shall everi word be establish

13:2 i told you befor and foretel you as if i were present the
second time; and be absent now i write to them which heretofor
have sin and to all other that if i come again i will not
spare: 13:3 sinc ye seek a proof of christ speak in me which to
you-ward is not weak but is mighti in you

13:4 for though he wa crucifi through weak yet he liveth by
the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with
him by the power of god toward you

13:5 examin yourselv whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
selv know ye not your own selv how that jesu christ is in you
except ye be reprobates? 13:6 but i trust that ye shall know that we
are not reprob

13:7 now i pray to god that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
approv but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as
reprob

13:8 for we can do noth against the truth but for the truth

13:9 for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong: and thi
also we wish even your perfect

13:10 therefor i write these thing be absent lest be present
i should use sharp accord to the power which the lord hath
given me to edif and not to destruct

13:11 final brethren farewel be perfect be of good comfort be
of one mind live in peace; and the god of love and peac shall be
with you

13:12 greet one anoth with an holi kiss

13:13 all the saint salut you

13:14 the grace of the lord jesu christ and the love of god and the
communion of the holi ghost be with you all amen

1:1 paul an apostl (not of men neither by man but by jesu
christ and god the father who rais him from the dead;) 1:2 and all
the brethren which are with me unto the church of galatia: 1:3
grace be to you and peac from god the father and from our lord jesu
christ 1:4 who gave himself for our sin that he might deliv us
from thi present evil world accord to the will of god and our
father: 1:5 to whom be glori for ever and ever amen

1:6 i marvel that ye are so soon remov from him that call you into
the grace of christ unto anoth gospel: 1:7 which is not another; but
there be some that troubl you and would pervert the gospel of
christ

1:8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach ani other gospel
unto you than that which we have preach unto you let him be
accurs

1:9 as we said befor so say i now again if ani man preach ani other
gospel unto you than that ye have receiv let him be accurs

1:10 for do i now persuad men or god? or do i seek to pleas men?
for if i yet pleas men i should not be the servant of christ

1:11 but i certifi you brethren that the gospel which wa preach
of me is not after man

1:12 for i neither receiv it of man neither wa i taught it but by
the revel of jesu christ

1:13 for ye have heard of my convers in time past in the jew
religion how that beyond measur i persecut the church of god and
wast it: 1:14 and profit in the jew religion abov mani my
equal in mine own nation be more exceedingli zealou of the
tradit of my father

1:15 but when it pleas god who separ me from my mother womb
and call me by hi grace 1:16 to reveal hi son in me that i might
preach him among the heathen; immedi i confer not with flesh
and blood: 1:17 neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were
apostl befor me; but i went into arabia and return again unto
damascu

1:18 then after three year i went up to jerusalem to see peter and
abod with him fifteen day

1:19 but other of the apostl saw i none save jame the lord
brother

1:20 now the thing which i write unto you behold befor god i lie
not

1:21 afterward i came into the region of syria and cilicia; 1:22 and
wa unknown by face unto the church of judaea which were in christ:
1:23 but they had heard onli that he which persecut us in time
past now preacheth the faith which onc he destroy

1:24 and they glorifi god in me

2:1 then fourteen year after i went up again to jerusalem with
barnaba and took titu with me also

2:2 and i went up by revel and commun unto them that
gospel which i preach among the gentil but privat to them which
were of reput lest by ani mean i should run or had run in
vain

2:3 but neither titu who wa with me be a greek wa compel
to be circumcised: 2:4 and that becaus of fals brethren unawar
brought in who came in privili to spi out our liberti which we have
in christ jesu that they might bring us into bondage: 2:5 to whom we
gave place by subject no not for an hour; that the truth of the
gospel might continu with you

2:6 but of these who seem to be somewhat (whatsoev they were it
maketh no matter to me: god accepteth no man person:) for they who
seem to be somewhat in confer ad noth to me: 2:7 but
contrariwis when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcis wa
commit unto me as the gospel of the circumcis wa unto peter;
2:8 (for he that wrought effectu in peter to the apostleship of
the circumcis the same wa mighti in me toward the gentiles:) 2:9
and when jame cepha and john who seem to be pillar perceiv
the grace that wa given unto me they gave to me and barnaba the
right hand of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen and
they unto the circumcis

2:10 onli they would that we should rememb the poor; the same which
i also wa forward to do

2:11 but when peter wa come to antioch i withstood him to the face
becaus he wa to be blame

2:12 for befor that certain came from jame he did eat with the
gentiles: but when they were come he withdrew and separ himself
fear them which were of the circumcis

2:13 and the other jew dissembl likewis with him; insomuch that
barnaba also wa carri away with their dissimul

2:14 but when i saw that they walk not uprightli accord to the
truth of the gospel i said unto peter befor them all if thou be
a jew livest after the manner of gentil and not as do the jew
whi compellest thou the gentil to live as do the jews? 2:15 we who
are jew by natur and not sinner of the gentil 2:16 know that
a man is not justifi by the work of the law but by the faith of
jesu christ even we have believ in jesu christ that we might be
justifi by the faith of christ and not by the work of the law: for
by the work of the law shall no flesh be justifi

2:17 but if while we seek to be justifi by christ we ourselv
also are found sinner is therefor christ the minist of sin? god
forbid

2:18 for if i build again the thing which i destroy i make myself
a transgressor

2:19 for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto
god

2:20 i am crucifi with christ: neverthless i live; yet not i but
christ liveth in me: and the life which i now live in the flesh i live
by the faith of the son of god who love me and gave himself for me

2:21 i do not frustrat the grace of god: for if righteous come by
the law then christ is dead in vain

3:1 o foolish galatian who hath bewitch you that ye should not
obey the truth befor whose eye jesu christ hath been evid set
forth crucifi among you? 3:2 thi onli would i learn of you
receiv ye the spirit by the work of the law or by the hear of
faith? 3:3 are ye so foolish? have begun in the spirit are ye now
made perfect by the flesh? 3:4 have ye suffer so mani thing in
vain? if it be yet in vain

3:5 he therefor that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh
miracl among you doeth he it by the work of the law or by the
hear of faith? 3:6 even as abraham believ god and it wa
account to him for righteous

3:7 know ye therefor that they which are of faith the same are the
children of abraham

3:8 and the scriptur forese that god would justifi the heathen
through faith preach befor the gospel unto abraham say in
thee shall all nation be bless

3:9 so then they which be of faith are bless with faith abraham

3:10 for as mani as are of the work of the law are under the curse:
for it is written curs is everi one that continueth not in all
thing which are written in the book of the law to do them

3:11 but that no man is justifi by the law in the sight of god it
is evident: for the just shall live by faith

3:12 and the law is not of faith: but the man that doeth them shall
live in them

3:13 christ hath redeem us from the curs of the law be made a
curs for us: for it is written curs is everi one that hangeth on a
tree: 3:14 that the bless of abraham might come on the gentil
through jesu christ; that we might receiv the promis of the spirit
through faith

3:15 brethren i speak after the manner of men; though it be but a
man coven yet if it be confirm no man disannulleth or addeth
thereto

3:16 now to abraham and hi seed were the promis made he saith not
and to seed as of many; but as of one and to thi seed which is
christ

3:17 and thi i say that the coven that wa confirm befor of
god in christ the law which wa four hundr and thirti year after
cannot disannul that it should make the promis of none effect

3:18 for if the inherit be of the law it is no more of promise:
but god gave it to abraham by promis

3:19 wherefor then serveth the law? it wa ad becaus of
transgress till the seed should come to whom the promis wa
made; and it wa ordain by angel in the hand of a mediat

3:20 now a mediat is not a mediat of one but god is one

3:21 is the law then against the promis of god? god forbid: for if
there had been a law given which could have given life verili
righteous should have been by the law

3:22 but the scriptur hath conclud all under sin that the promis
by faith of jesu christ might be given to them that believ

3:23 but befor faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto
the faith which should afterward be reveal

3:24 wherefor the law wa our schoolmast to bring us unto christ
that we might be justifi by faith

3:25 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a
schoolmast

3:26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesu

3:27 for as mani of you as have been baptiz into christ have put on
christ

3:28 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free
there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in christ jesu

3:29 and if ye be christ then are ye abraham seed and heir
accord to the promis

4:1 now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth
noth from a servant though he be lord of all; 4:2 but is under
tutor and governor until the time appoint of the father

4:3 even so we when we were children were in bondag under the
element of the world: 4:4 but when the ful of the time wa come
god sent forth hi son made of a woman made under the law 4:5 to
redeem them that were under the law that we might receiv the
adopt of son

4:6 and becaus ye are son god hath sent forth the spirit of hi son
into your heart cri abba father

4:7 wherefor thou art no more a servant but a son; and if a son
then an heir of god through christ

4:8 howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did servic unto them which
by natur are no god

4:9 but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarli element whereunto ye
desir again to be in bondage? 4:10 ye observ day and month and
time and year

4:11 i am afraid of you lest i have bestow upon you labour in vain

4:12 brethren i beseech you be as i am; for i am as ye are: ye have
not injur me at all

4:13 ye know how through infirm of the flesh i preach the gospel
unto you at the first

4:14 and my temptat which wa in my flesh ye despis not nor
rejected; but receiv me as an angel of god even as christ jesu

4:15 where is then the blessed ye spake of? for i bear you record
that if it had been possibl ye would have pluck out your own
eye and have given them to me

4:16 am i therefor becom your enemi becaus i tell you the truth?
4:17 they zealous affect you but not well; yea they would exclud
you that ye might affect them

4:18 but it is good to be zealous affect alway in a good thing
and not onli when i am present with you

4:19 my littl children of whom i travail in birth again until christ
be form in you 4:20 i desir to be present with you now and to
chang my voice; for i stand in doubt of you

4:21 tell me ye that desir to be under the law do ye not hear the
law? 4:22 for it is written that abraham had two son the one by a
bondmaid the other by a freewoman

4:23 but he who wa of the bondwoman wa born after the flesh; but he
of the freewoman wa by promis

4:24 which thing are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondag which is
agar

4:25 for thi agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to
jerusalem which now is and is in bondag with her children

4:26 but jerusalem which is abov is free which is the mother of us
all

4:27 for it is written rejoic thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cri thou that travailest not: for the desol hath mani
more children than she which hath an husband

4:28 now we brethren as isaac wa are the children of promis

4:29 but as then he that wa born after the flesh persecut him that
wa born after the spirit even so it is now

4:30 nevertheless what saith the scripture? cast out the bondwoman and
her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman

4:31 so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of
the free

5:1 stand fast therefor in the liberti wherewith christ hath made us
free and be not entangl again with the yoke of bondag

5:2 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcis christ
shall profit you noth

5:3 for i testifi again to everi man that is circumcis that he is a
debtor to do the whole law

5:4 christ is becom of no effect unto you whosoev of you are
justifi by the law; ye are fallen from grace

5:5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteous by
faith

5:6 for in jesu christ neither circumcis availeth ani thing nor
uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love

5:7 ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
truth? 5:8 thi persuas cometh not of him that calleth you

5:9 a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump

5:10 i have confid in you through the lord that ye will be none
otherwis minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear hi judgment
whosoev he be

5:11 and i brethren if i yet preach circumcis whi do i yet
suffer persecution? then is the offenc of the cross ceas

5:12 i would they were even cut off which troubl you

5:13 for brethren ye have been call unto liberty; onli use not
liberti for an occas to the flesh but by love serv one anoth

5:14 for all the law is fulfil in one word even in this; thou
shalt love thi neighbour as thyself

5:15 but if ye bite and devour one anoth take heed that ye be not
consum one of anoth

5:16 thi i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh

5:17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against
the flesh: and these are contrari the one to the other: so that ye
cannot do the thing that ye would

5:18 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law

5:19 now the work of the flesh are manifest which are these;
adulteri fornic unclean lascivi 5:20 idolatri
witchcraft hatr varianc emul wrath strife sedit
heresi 5:21 envi murder drunken revel and such
like: of the which i tell you befor as i have also told you in time
past that they which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of
god

5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peac longsuff
gentl good faith 5:23 meek temperance: against such
there is no law

5:24 and they that are christ have crucifi the flesh with the
affect and lust

5:25 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit

5:26 let us not be desir of vain glori provok one anoth
envi one anoth

6:1 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are
spiritu restor such an one in the spirit of meekness; consid
thyself lest thou also be tempt

6:2 bear ye one anoth burden and so fulfil the law of christ

6:3 for if a man think himself to be someth when he is noth he
deceiveth himself

6:4 but let everi man prove hi own work and then shall he have
rejoic in himself alon and not in anoth

6:5 for everi man shall bear hi own burden

6:6 let him that is taught in the word commun unto him that
teacheth in all good thing

6:7 be not deceived; god is not mocked: for whatsoev a man soweth
that shall he also reap

6:8 for he that soweth to hi flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
life everlast

6:9 and let us not be weari in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap if we faint not

6:10 as we have therefor opportun let us do good unto all men
especi unto them who are of the household of faith

6:11 ye see how larg a letter i have written unto you with mine own
hand

6:12 as mani as desir to make a fair shew in the flesh they
constrain you to be circumcised; onli lest they should suffer
persecut for the cross of christ

6:13 for neither they themselv who are circumcis keep the law; but
desir to have you circumcis that they may glori in your flesh

6:14 but god forbid that i should glori save in the cross of our lord
jesu christ by whom the world is crucifi unto me and i unto the
world

6:15 for in christ jesu neither circumcis availeth ani thing nor
uncircumcis but a new creatur

6:16 and as mani as walk accord to thi rule peac be on them and
merci and upon the israel of god

6:17 from henceforth let no man troubl me: for i bear in my bodi the
mark of the lord jesu

6:18 brethren the grace of our lord jesu christ be with your spirit

amen

into the lower part of the earth? 4:10 he that descend is the same
also that ascend up far abov all heaven that he might fill all
things) 4:11 and he gave some apostles; and some prophets; and
some evangelists; and some pastor and teachers; 4:12 for the
perfect of the saint for the work of the ministri for the
edifi of the bodi of christ: 4:13 till we all come in the uniti of

henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carri about
with everi wind of doctrin by the sleight of men and cun
crafti wherebi they lie in wait to deceive; 4:15 but speak the
truth in love may grow up into him in all thing which is the head
even christ: 4:16 from whom the whole bodi fitli join togeth and
compact by that which everi joint supplieth accord to the
effectu work in the measur of everi part maketh increas of the
bodi unto the edifi of itself in love

4:17 thi i say therefor and testifi in the lord that ye henceforth
walk not as other gentil walk in the vaniti of their mind 4:18
have the understand darken be alien from the life of
god through the ignor that is in them becaus of the blind of
their heart: 4:19 who be past feel have given themselv over
unto lascivi to work all unclean with greedi

4:20 but ye have not so learn christ; 4:21 if so be that ye have
heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus: 4:22
that ye put off concern the former convers the old man which
is corrupt accord to the deceit lusts; 4:23 and be renew in
the spirit of your mind; 4:24 and that ye put on the new man which
after god is creat in righteous and true holi

4:25 wherefor put away lie speak everi man truth with hi
neighbour: for we are member one of anoth

4:26 be ye angri and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
wrath: 4:27 neither give place to the devil

4:28 let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour
work with hi hand the thing which is good that he may have to
give to him that needeth

4:29 let no corrupt commun proceed out of your mouth but that
which is good to the use of edifi that it may minist grace unto
the hearer

4:30 and griev not the holi spirit of god wherebi ye are seal unto
the day of redempt

4:31 let all bitter and wrath and anger and clamour and evil
speak be put away from you with all malice: 4:32 and be ye kind
one to anoth tenderheart forgiv one anoth even as god for
christ sake hath forgiven you

5:1 be ye therefor follow of god as dear children; 5:2 and walk
in love as christ also hath love us and hath given himself for us
an offer and a sacrific to god for a sweetsmel savour

5:3 but fornic and all unclean or covet let it not
be onc name among you as becometh saints; 5:4 neither filthi
nor foolish talk nor jest which are not convenient: but rather
give of thank

5:5 for thi ye know that no whoremong nor unclean person nor
covet man who is an idolat hath ani inherit in the kingdom
of christ and of god

5:6 let no man deceiv you with vain words: for becaus of these
thing cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedi

5:7 be not ye therefor partak with them

5:8 for ye were sometim dark but now are ye light in the lord:
walk as children of light: 5:9 (for the fruit of the spirit is in all
good and righteous and truth;) 5:10 prove what is accept
unto the lord

5:11 and have no fellowship with the unfruit work of dark but
rather reprov them

5:12 for it is a shame even to speak of those thing which are done of
them in secret

5:13 but all thing that are reprov are made manifest by the light:
for whatsoev doth make manifest is light

5:14 wherefor he saith awak thou that sleepest and aris from the
dead and christ shall give thee light

5:15 see then that ye walk circumspectli not as fool but as wise
5:16 redeem the time becaus the day are evil

5:17 wherefor be ye not unwis but understand what the will of
the lord is

5:18 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess; but be fill with
the spirit; 5:19 speak to yourselv in psalm and hymn and
spiritu song sing and make melodi in your heart to the lord;
5:20 give thank alway for all thing unto god and the father in
the name of our lord jesu christ; 5:21 submit yourselv one to
anoth in the fear of god

5:22 wive submit yourselv unto your own husband as unto the
lord

5:23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the
head of the church: and he is the saviour of the bodi

5:24 therefor as the church is subject unto christ so let the wive
be to their own husband in everi thing

5:25 husband love your wive even as christ also love the church
and gave himself for it; 5:26 that he might sanctifi and cleans it
with the wash of water by the word 5:27 that he might present it
to himself a gloriou church not have spot or wrinkl or ani such
thing; but that it should be holi and without blemish

5:28 so ought men to love their wive as their own bodi he that
loveth hi wife loveth himself

5:29 for no man ever yet hate hi own flesh; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it even as the lord the church: 5:30 for we are member of
hi bodi of hi flesh and of hi bone

5:31 for thi caus shall a man leav hi father and mother and shall
be join unto hi wife and they two shall be one flesh

5:32 thi is a great mystery: but i speak concern christ and the
church

5:33 nevertheless let everi one of you in particular so love hi wife
even as himself; and the wife see that she rever her husband

6:1 children obey your parent in the lord: for thi is right

6:2 honour thi father and mother; which is the first command with
promise; 6:3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long
on the earth

6:4 and ye father provok not your children to wrath: but bring
them up in the nurtur and admonit of the lord

6:5 servant be obedi to them that are your master accord to
the flesh with fear and trembl in singl of your heart as
unto christ; 6:6 not with eyeservic as menpleasers; but as the
servant of christ do the will of god from the heart; 6:7 with
good will do servic as to the lord and not to men: 6:8 know
that whatsoev good thing ani man doeth the same shall he receiv of
the lord whether he be bond or free

6:9 and ye master do the same thing unto them forbear
threatening: know that your master also is in heaven; neither is
there respect of person with him

6:10 final my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of
hi might

6:11 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be abl to stand
against the wile of the devil

6:12 for we wrestl not against flesh and blood but against
princip against power against the ruler of the dark of
thi world against spiritu wicked in high place

6:13 wherefor take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be
abl to withstand in the evil day and have done all to stand

6:14 stand therefor have your loin girt about with truth and
have on the breastplat of righteousness; 6:15 and your feet shod
with the prepar of the gospel of peace; 6:16 abov all take
the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be abl to quench all the
fieri dart of the wick

6:17 and take the helmet of salvat and the sword of the spirit

the epistl of paul the apostl to the philippian


1:1 paul and timotheu the servant of jesu christ to all the
saint in christ jesu which are at philippi with the bishop and
deacons: 1:2 grace be unto you and peac from god our father and
from the lord jesu christ

1:3 i thank my god upon everi remembr of you 1:4 alway in everi
prayer of mine for you all make request with joy 1:5 for your
fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 1:6 be
confid of thi veri thing that he which hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of jesu christ: 1:7 even as it is
meet for me to think thi of you all becaus i have you in my heart;
inasmuch as both in my bond and in the defenc and confirm of
the gospel ye all are partak of my grace

1:8 for god is my record how greatli i long after you all in the
bowel of jesu christ

1:9 and thi i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledg and in all judgment; 1:10 that ye may approv thing that
are excellent; that ye may be sincer and without offenc till the day
of christ

1:11 be fill with the fruit of righteous which are by jesu
christ unto the glori and prais of god

1:12 but i would ye should understand brethren that the thing which
happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the further of the
gospel; 1:13 so that my bond in christ are manifest in all the
palac and in all other places; 1:14 and mani of the brethren in the
lord wax confid by my bond are much more bold to speak the
word without fear

1:15 some inde preach christ even of envi and strife; and some also
of good will: 1:16 the one preach christ of content not sincer
suppos to add afflict to my bonds: 1:17 but the other of love
know that i am set for the defenc of the gospel

1:18 what then? notwithstand everi way whether in pretenc or in
truth christ is preached; and i therein do rejoic yea and will
rejoic

1:19 for i know that thi shall turn to my salvat through your
prayer and the suppli of the spirit of jesu christ 1:20 accord
to my earnest expect and my hope that in noth i shall be
asham but that with all bold as alway so now also christ
shall be magnifi in my bodi whether it be by life or by death

1:21 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain

1:22 but if i live in the flesh thi is the fruit of my labour: yet
what i shall choos i wot not

1:23 for i am in a strait betwixt two have a desir to depart and
to be with christ; which is far better: 1:24 nevertheless to abid in
the flesh is more need for you

1:25 and have thi confid i know that i shall abid and
continu with you all for your further and joy of faith; 1:26 that
your rejoic may be more abund in jesu christ for me by my
come to you again

1:27 onli let your convers be as it becometh the gospel of
christ: that whether i come and see you or els be absent i may hear
of your affair that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind
strive togeth for the faith of the gospel; 1:28 and in noth
terrifi by your adversaries: which is to them an evid token of
perdit but to you of salvat and that of god

1:29 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not onli to
believ on him but also to suffer for hi sake; 1:30 have the same
conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me

2:1 if there be therefor ani consol in christ if ani comfort of
love if ani fellowship of the spirit if ani bowel and merci 2:2
fulfil ye my joy that ye be likemind have the same love be
of one accord of one mind

2:3 let noth be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowli
of mind let each esteem other better than themselv

2:4 look not everi man on hi own thing but everi man also on the
thing of other

2:5 let thi mind be in you which wa also in christ jesus: 2:6 who
be in the form of god thought it not robberi to be equal with god:
2:7 but made himself of no reput and took upon him the form of a
servant and wa made in the like of men: 2:8 and be found in
fashion as a man he humbl himself and becam obedi unto death
even the death of the cross

2:9 wherefor god also hath highli exalt him and given him a name
which is abov everi name: 2:10 that at the name of jesu everi knee
should bow of thing in heaven and thing in earth and thing under
the earth; 2:11 and that everi tongu should confess that jesu christ
is lord to the glori of god the father

2:12 wherefor my belov as ye have alway obey not as in my
presenc onli but now much more in my absenc work out your own
salvat with fear and trembl

2:13 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of hi
good pleasur

2:14 do all thing without murmur and disputings: 2:15 that ye may
be blameless and harmless the son of god without rebuk in the
midst of a crook and pervers nation among whom ye shine as light
in the world; 2:16 hold forth the word of life; that i may rejoic
in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labour in
vain

2:17 yea and if i be offer upon the sacrific and servic of your
faith i joy and rejoic with you all

2:18 for the same caus also do ye joy and rejoic with me

2:19 but i trust in the lord jesu to send timotheu shortli unto you
that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state

2:20 for i have no man likemind who will natur care for your
state

2:21 for all seek their own not the thing which are jesu christ

2:22 but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he
hath serv with me in the gospel

2:23 him therefor i hope to send present so soon as i shall see
how it will go with me

2:24 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortli

2:25 yet i suppos it necessari to send to you epaphroditu my
brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldi but your
messeng and he that minist to my want

2:26 for he long after you all and wa full of heavi becaus
that ye had heard that he had been sick

2:27 for inde he wa sick nigh unto death: but god had merci on him;
and not on him onli but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon
sorrow

2:28 i sent him therefor the more care that when ye see him
again ye may rejoic and that i may be the less sorrow

2:29 receiv him therefor in the lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation: 2:30 becaus for the work of christ he wa nigh
unto death not regard hi life to suppli your lack of servic
toward me

3:1 final my brethren rejoic in the lord to write the same
thing to you to me inde is not grievou but for you it is safe

3:2 bewar of dog bewar of evil worker bewar of the concis

3:3 for we are the circumcis which worship god in the spirit and
rejoic in christ jesu and have no confid in the flesh

3:4 though i might also have confid in the flesh if ani other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more: 3:5
circumcis the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of
benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews; as touch the law a pharisee;
3:6 concern zeal persecut the church; touch the
righteous which is in the law blameless

3:7 but what thing were gain to me those i count loss for christ

3:8 yea doubtless and i count all thing but loss for the excel
of the knowledg of christ jesu my lord: for whom i have suffer the
loss of all thing and do count them but dung that i may win christ
3:9 and be found in him not have mine own righteous which is
of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the
righteous which is of god by faith: 3:10 that i may know him and
the power of hi resurrect and the fellowship of hi suffer
be made conform unto hi death; 3:11 if by ani mean i might
attain unto the resurrect of the dead

3:12 not as though i had alreadi attain either were alreadi
perfect: but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which
also i am apprehend of christ jesu

3:13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended: but thi one
thing i do forget those thing which are behind and reach
forth unto those thing which are befor 3:14 i press toward the mark
for the prize of the high call of god in christ jesu

3:15 let us therefor as mani as be perfect be thu minded: and if
in ani thing ye be otherwis mind god shall reveal even thi unto
you

3:16 nevertheless whereto we have alreadi attain let us walk by
the same rule let us mind the same thing

3:17 brethren be follow togeth of me and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an ensampl

3:18 (for mani walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you
even weep that they are the enemi of the cross of christ: 3:19
whose end is destruct whose god is their belli and whose glori is
in their shame who mind earthli things) 3:20 for our convers
is in heaven; from whenc also we look for the saviour the lord jesu
christ: 3:21 who shall chang our vile bodi that it may be fashion
like unto hi gloriou bodi accord to the work wherebi he is
abl even to subdu all thing unto himself

4:1 therefor my brethren dearli belov and long for my joy and
crown so stand fast in the lord my dearli belov

mind in the lord

wa not in vain: 2:2 but even after that we had suffer befor and
were shame entreat as ye know at philippi we were bold in
our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much content

2:3 for our exhort wa not of deceit nor of unclean nor in
guile: 2:4 but as we were allow of god to be put in trust with the
gospel even so we speak; not as pleas men but god which trieth
our heart

2:5 for neither at ani time use we flatter word as ye know nor
a cloke of covetousness; god is witness: 2:6 nor of men sought we
glori neither of you nor yet of other when we might have been
burdensom as the apostl of christ

2:7 but we were gentl among you even as a nurs cherisheth her
children: 2:8 so be affection desir of you we were will
to have impart unto you not the gospel of god onli but also our
own soul becaus ye were dear unto us

2:9 for ye rememb brethren our labour and travail: for labour
night and day becaus we would not be chargeabl unto ani of you we
preach unto you the gospel of god

2:10 ye are wit and god also how holili and justli and
unblam we behav ourselv among you that believe: 2:11 as ye
know how we exhort and comfort and charg everi one of you as a
father doth hi children 2:12 that ye would walk worthi of god who
hath call you unto hi kingdom and glori

2:13 for thi caus also thank we god without ceas becaus when
ye receiv the word of god which ye heard of us ye receiv it not
as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which
effectu worketh also in you that believ

2:14 for ye brethren becam follow of the church of god which
in judaea are in christ jesus: for ye also have suffer like thing
of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews: 2:15 who both
kill the lord jesu and their own prophet and have persecut us;
and they pleas not god and are contrari to all men: 2:16 forbid
us to speak to the gentil that they might be save to fill up their
sin alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost

2:17 but we brethren be taken from you for a short time in
presenc not in heart endeavour the more abundantli to see your
face with great desir

2:18 wherefor we would have come unto you even i paul onc and
again; but satan hinder us

2:19 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing? are not even
ye in the presenc of our lord jesu christ at hi coming? 2:20 for
ye are our glori and joy

3:1 wherefor when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to
be left at athen alone; 3:2 and sent timotheu our brother and
minist of god and our fellowlabour in the gospel of christ to
establish you and to comfort you concern your faith: 3:3 that no
man should be move by these afflictions: for yourselv know that we
are appoint thereunto

3:4 for verili when we were with you we told you befor that we
should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass and ye know

3:5 for thi caus when i could no longer forbear i sent to know
your faith lest by some mean the tempter have tempt you and our
labour be in vain

3:6 but now when timotheu came from you unto us and brought us good
tide of your faith and chariti and that ye have good remembr
of us alway desir greatli to see us as we also to see you: 3:7
therefor brethren we were comfort over you in all our afflict
and distress by your faith: 3:8 for now we live if ye stand fast in
the lord

3:9 for what thank can we render to god again for you for all the
joy wherewith we joy for your sake befor our god; 3:10 night and day
pray exceedingli that we might see your face and might perfect
that which is lack in your faith? 3:11 now god himself and our
father and our lord jesu christ direct our way unto you

3:12 and the lord make you to increas and abound in love one toward
anoth and toward all men even as we do toward you: 3:13 to the end
he may stablish your heart unblam in holi befor god even
our father at the come of our lord jesu christ with all hi
saint

4:1 furthermor then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the
lord jesu that as ye have receiv of us how ye ought to walk and to
pleas god so ye would abound more and more

4:2 for ye know what command we gave you by the lord jesu

4:3 for thi is the will of god even your sanctif that ye
should abstain from fornication: 4:4 that everi one of you should know
how to possess hi vessel in sanctif and honour; 4:5 not in the
lust of concupisc even as the gentil which know not god: 4:6
that no man go beyond and defraud hi brother in ani matter: becaus
that the lord is the aveng of all such as we also have forewarn
you and testifi

4:7 for god hath not call us unto unclean but unto holi

4:8 he therefor that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath
also given unto us hi holi spirit

4:9 but as touch brotherli love ye need not that i write unto you:
for ye yourselv are taught of god to love one anoth

4:10 and inde ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
macedonia: but we beseech you brethren that ye increas more and
more; 4:11 and that ye studi to be quiet and to do your own busi
and to work with your own hand as we command you; 4:12 that ye may
walk honestli toward them that are without and that ye may have lack
of noth

4:13 but i would not have you to be ignor brethren concern
them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as other which have
no hope

4:14 for if we believ that jesu die and rose again even so them
also which sleep in jesu will god bring with him

4:15 for thi we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which
are aliv and remain unto the come of the lord shall not prevent
them which are asleep

4:16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with
the voic of the archangel and with the trump of god: and the dead in
christ shall rise first: 4:17 then we which are aliv and remain shall
be caught up togeth with them in the cloud to meet the lord in the
air: and so shall we ever be with the lord

4:18 wherefor comfort one anoth with these word

5:1 but of the time and the season brethren ye have no need that i
write unto you

5:2 for yourselv know perfectli that the day of the lord so cometh
as a thief in the night

5:3 for when they shall say peac and safety; then sudden destruct
cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
not escap

5:4 but ye brethren are not in dark that that day should
overtak you as a thief

5:5 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day: we
are not of the night nor of dark

5:6 therefor let us not sleep as do others; but let us watch and be
sober

5:7 for they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night

5:8 but let us who are of the day be sober put on the
breastplat of faith and love; and for an helmet the hope of
salvat

5:9 for god hath not appoint us to wrath but to obtain salvat by
our lord jesu christ 5:10 who die for us that whether we wake or
sleep we should live togeth with him

5:11 wherefor comfort yourselv togeth and edifi one anoth
even as also ye do

5:12 and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among
you and are over you in the lord and admonish you; 5:13 and to
esteem them veri highli in love for their work sake and be at peac
among yourselv

5:14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruli comfort
the feeblemind support the weak be patient toward all men

5:15 see that none render evil for evil unto ani man; but ever follow
that which is good both among yourselv and to all men

5:16 rejoic evermor

5:17 pray without ceas

5:18 in everi thing give thanks: for thi is the will of god in christ
jesu concern you

5:19 quench not the spirit

5:20 despis not prophesi

5:21 prove all things; hold fast that which is good

5:22 abstain from all appear of evil

5:23 and the veri god of peac sanctifi you wholly; and i pray god
your whole spirit and soul and bodi be preserv blameless unto the
come of our lord jesu christ

5:24 faith is he that calleth you who also will do it

5:25 brethren pray for us

5:26 greet all the brethren with an holi kiss

5:27 i charg you by the lord that thi epistl be read unto all the
holi brethren

5:28 the grace of our lord jesu christ be with you amen

the lord and from the glori of hi power; 1:10 when he shall come to
be glorifi in hi saint and to be admir in all them that believ
(becaus our testimoni among you wa believed) in that day

1:11 wherefor also we pray alway for you that our god would count

except there come a fall away first and that man of sin be
reveal the son of perdition; 2:4 who opposeth and exalteth himself
abov all that is call god or that is worshipped; so that he as god
sitteth in the templ of god shew himself that he is god

2:5 rememb ye not that when i wa yet with you i told you these
things? 2:6 and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
reveal in hi time

2:7 for the mysteri of iniqu doth alreadi work: onli he who now
letteth will let until he be taken out of the way

2:8 and then shall that wick be reveal whom the lord shall
consum with the spirit of hi mouth and shall destroy with the
bright of hi coming: 2:9 even him whose come is after the
work of satan with all power and sign and lie wonder 2:10 and
with all deceiv of unright in them that perish;
becaus they receiv not the love of the truth that they might be
save

2:11 and for thi caus god shall send them strong delus that they
should believ a lie: 2:12 that they all might be damn who believ
not the truth but had pleasur in unright

2:13 but we are bound to give thank alway to god for you brethren
belov of the lord becaus god hath from the begin chosen you to

the first epistl of paul the apostl to timothi


1:1 paul an apostl of jesu christ by the command of god our
saviour and lord jesu christ which is our hope; 1:2 unto timothi
my own son in the faith: grace merci and peac from god our father
and jesu christ our lord

1:3 as i besought thee to abid still at ephesu when i went into
macedonia that thou mightest charg some that they teach no other
doctrin 1:4 neither give heed to fabl and endless genealog
which minist question rather than godli edifi which is in
faith: so do

1:5 now the end of the command is chariti out of a pure heart and
of a good conscienc and of faith unfeigned: 1:6 from which some
have swerv have turn asid unto vain jangling; 1:7 desir to
be teacher of the law; understand neither what they say nor
whereof they affirm

1:8 but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully; 1:9
know thi that the law is not made for a righteou man but for
the lawless and disobedi for the ungodli and for sinner for
unholi and profan for murder of father and murder of mother
for manslay 1:10 for whoremong for them that defil themselv
with mankind for mensteal for liar for perjur person and if
there be ani other thing that is contrari to sound doctrine; 1:11
accord to the gloriou gospel of the bless god which wa
commit to my trust

1:12 and i thank christ jesu our lord who hath enabl me for that
he count me faith put me into the ministry; 1:13 who wa
befor a blasphem and a persecutor and injurious: but i obtain
merci becaus i did it ignorantli in unbelief

1:14 and the grace of our lord wa exceed abund with faith and
love which is in christ jesu

1:15 thi is a faith say and worthi of all accept that
christ jesu came into the world to save sinners; of whom i am chief

1:16 howbeit for thi caus i obtain merci that in me first jesu
christ might shew forth all longsuff for a pattern to them which
should hereaft believ on him to life everlast

1:17 now unto the king etern immort invis the onli wise
god be honour and glori for ever and ever amen

1:18 thi charg i commit unto thee son timothi accord to the
propheci which went befor on thee that thou by them mightest war a
good warfare; 1:19 hold faith and a good conscience; which some
have put away concern faith have made shipwreck: 1:20 of whom is
hymenaeu and alexander; whom i have deliv unto satan that they
may learn not to blasphem

2:1 i exhort therefor that first of all supplic prayer
intercess and give of thank be made for all men; 2:2 for
king and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and
peaceabl life in all godli and honesti

2:3 for thi is good and accept in the sight of god our saviour;
2:4 who will have all men to be save and to come unto the knowledg
of the truth

2:5 for there is one god and one mediat between god and men the
man christ jesus; 2:6 who gave himself a ransom for all to be
testifi in due time

2:7 whereunto i am ordain a preacher and an apostl (i speak the
truth in christ and lie not;) a teacher of the gentil in faith and
veriti

2:8 i will therefor that men pray everi where lift up holi hand
without wrath and doubt

2:9 in like manner also that women adorn themselv in modest
apparel with shamefaced and sobriety; not with broid hair or
gold or pearl or costli array; 2:10 but (which becometh women
profess godliness) with good work

2:11 let the woman learn in silenc with all subject

2:12 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp author over
the man but to be in silenc

2:13 for adam wa first form then eve

2:14 and adam wa not deceiv but the woman be deceiv wa in
the transgress

2:15 notwithstand she shall be save in childbear if they
continu in faith and chariti and holi with sobrieti

3:1 thi is a true say if a man desir the offic of a bishop he
desireth a good work

3:2 a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife
vigil sober of good behaviour given to hospit apt to
teach; 3:3 not given to wine no striker not greedi of filthi lucre;
but patient not a brawler not covetous; 3:4 one that ruleth well hi
own hous have hi children in subject with all gravity; 3:5
(for if a man know not how to rule hi own hous how shall he take
care of the church of god?) 3:6 not a novic lest be lift up
with pride he fall into the condemn of the devil

3:7 moreov he must have a good report of them which are without;
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil

3:8 likewis must the deacon be grave not doubletongu not given
to much wine not greedi of filthi lucre; 3:9 hold the mysteri of
the faith in a pure conscienc

3:10 and let these also first be proved; then let them use the offic
of a deacon be found blameless

3:11 even so must their wive be grave not slander sober
faith in all thing

3:12 let the deacon be the husband of one wife rule their
children and their own hous well

3:13 for they that have use the offic of a deacon well purchas to
themselv a good degre and great bold in the faith which is in
christ jesu

3:14 these thing write i unto thee hope to come unto thee shortly:
3:15 but if i tarri long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behav thyself in the hous of god which is the church of the live
god the pillar and ground of the truth

3:16 and without controversi great is the mysteri of godliness: god
wa manifest in the flesh justifi in the spirit seen of angel
preach unto the gentil believ on in the world receiv up into
glori

4:1 now the spirit speaketh expressli that in the latter time some
shall depart from the faith give heed to seduc spirit and
doctrin of devils; 4:2 speak lie in hypocrisy; have their
conscienc sear with a hot iron; 4:3 forbid to marri and
command to abstain from meat which god hath creat to be
receiv with thanksgiv of them which believ and know the truth

4:4 for everi creatur of god is good and noth to be refus if
it be receiv with thanksgiving: 4:5 for it is sanctifi by the word
of god and prayer

4:6 if thou put the brethren in remembr of these thing thou
shalt be a good minist of jesu christ nourish up in the word of
faith and of good doctrin whereunto thou hast attain

4:7 but refus profan and old wive fabl and exercis thyself
rather unto godli

4:8 for bodili exercis profiteth little: but godli is profit
unto all thing have promis of the life that now is and of that
which is to come

4:9 thi is a faith say and worthi of all accept

4:10 for therefor we both labour and suffer reproach becaus we
trust in the live god who is the saviour of all men special of
those that believ

4:11 these thing command and teach

4:12 let no man despis thi youth; but be thou an exampl of the
believ in word in convers in chariti in spirit in faith
in puriti

4:13 till i come give attend to read to exhort to
doctrin

4:14 neglect not the gift that is in thee which wa given thee by
propheci with the lay on of the hand of the presbyteri

4:15 medit upon these things; give thyself wholli to them; that thi
profit may appear to all

4:16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine; continu in them:
for in do thi thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear
thee

5:1 rebuk not an elder but intreat him as a father; and the younger
men as brethren; 5:2 the elder women as mothers; the younger as
sister with all puriti

5:3 honour widow that are widow inde

5:4 but if ani widow have children or nephew let them learn first to
shew pieti at home and to requit their parents: for that is good and
accept befor god

5:5 now she that is a widow inde and desol trusteth in god and
continueth in supplic and prayer night and day

5:6 but she that liveth in pleasur is dead while she liveth

5:7 and these thing give in charg that they may be blameless

5:8 but if ani provid not for hi own and special for those of hi
own hous he hath deni the faith and is wors than an infidel

5:9 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescor year
old have been the wife of one man

5:10 well report of for good works; if she have brought up children
if she have lodg stranger if she have wash the saint feet if
she have reliev the afflict if she have dilig follow everi
good work

5:11 but the younger widow refuse: for when they have begun to wax
wanton against christ they will marry; 5:12 have damnat becaus
they have cast off their first faith

5:13 and withal they learn to be idl wander about from hous to
house; and not onli idl but tattler also and busybodi speak
thing which they ought not

5:14 i will therefor that the younger women marri bear children
guid the hous give none occas to the adversari to speak
reproach

5:15 for some are alreadi turn asid after satan

5:16 if ani man or woman that believeth have widow let them reliev
them and let not the church be charged; that it may reliev them that
are widow inde

5:17 let the elder that rule well be count worthi of doubl honour
especi they who labour in the word and doctrin

5:18 for the scriptur saith thou shalt not muzzl the ox that
treadeth out the corn and the labour is worthi of hi reward

5:19 against an elder receiv not an accus but befor two or
three wit

5:20 them that sin rebuk befor all that other also may fear

5:21 i charg thee befor god and the lord jesu christ and the
elect angel that thou observ these thing without prefer one
befor anoth do noth by partial

5:22 lay hand suddenli on no man neither be partak of other men
sins: keep thyself pure

5:23 drink no longer water but use a littl wine for thi stomach
sake and thine often infirm

5:24 some men sin are open beforehand go befor to judgment;
and some men they follow after

5:25 likewis also the good work of some are manifest beforehand; and
they that are otherwis cannot be hid

6:1 let as mani servant as are under the yoke count their own master
worthi of all honour that the name of god and hi doctrin be not
blasphem

6:2 and they that have believ master let them not despis them
becaus they are brethren; but rather do them servic becaus they
are faith and belov partak of the benefit these thing teach
and exhort

6:3 if ani man teach otherwis and consent not to wholesom word
even the word of our lord jesu christ and to the doctrin which is
accord to godliness; 6:4 he is proud know noth but dote
about question and strife of word whereof cometh envi strife
rail evil surmis 6:5 pervers disput of men of corrupt
mind and destitut of the truth suppos that gain is godliness:
from such withdraw thyself

6:6 but godli with content is great gain

6:7 for we brought noth into thi world and it is certain we can
carri noth out

6:8 and have food and raiment let us be therewith content

6:9 but they that will be rich fall into temptat and a snare and
into mani foolish and hurt lust which drown men in destruct
and perdit

6:10 for the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
covet after they have er from the faith and pierc themselv
through with mani sorrow

6:11 but thou o man of god flee these things; and follow after
righteous godli faith love patienc meek

6:12 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on etern life
whereunto thou art also call and hast profess a good profess
befor mani wit

6:13 i give thee charg in the sight of god who quickeneth all
thing and befor christ jesu who befor pontiu pilat wit a
good confession; 6:14 that thou keep thi command without spot
unrebuk until the appear of our lord jesu christ: 6:15 which
in hi time he shall shew who is the bless and onli potent the
king of king and lord of lords; 6:16 who onli hath immort
dwell in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath
seen nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlast amen

6:17 charg them that are rich in thi world that they be not
highmind nor trust in uncertain rich but in the live god who
giveth us richli all thing to enjoy; 6:18 that they do good that
they be rich in good work readi to distribut will to
communicate; 6:19 lay up in store for themselv a good foundat
against the time to come that they may lay hold on etern life

6:20 o timothi keep that which is commit to thi trust avoid
profan and vain babbl and opposit of scienc fals so

1:16 the lord give merci unto the hous of onesiphorus; for he oft
refresh me and wa not asham of my chain: 1:17 but when he wa
in rome he sought me out veri dilig and found me

1:18 the lord grant unto him that he may find merci of the lord in
that day: and in how mani thing he minist unto me at ephesu
thou knowest veri well

2:1 thou therefor my son be strong in the grace that is in christ
jesu

2:2 and the thing that thou hast heard of me among mani wit
the same commit thou to faith men who shall be abl to teach
other also

2:3 thou therefor endur hard as a good soldier of jesu christ

2:4 no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affair of thi
life; that he may pleas him who hath chosen him to be a soldier

2:5 and if a man also strive for masteri yet is he not crown
except he strive law

2:6 the husbandman that laboureth must be first partak of the
fruit

2:7 consid what i say; and the lord give thee understand in all
thing

2:8 rememb that jesu christ of the seed of david wa rais from
the dead accord to my gospel: 2:9 wherein i suffer troubl as an
evil doer even unto bonds; but the word of god is not bound

2:10 therefor i endur all thing for the elect sake that they
may also obtain the salvat which is in christ jesu with etern
glori

2:11 it is a faith saying: for if we be dead with him we shall
also live with him: 2:12 if we suffer we shall also reign with him:
if we deni him he also will deni us: 2:13 if we believ not yet he
abideth faithful: he cannot deni himself

2:14 of these thing put them in remembr charg them befor the
lord that they strive not about word to no profit but to the
subvert of the hearer

2:15 studi to shew thyself approv unto god a workman that needeth
not to be asham rightli divid the word of truth

2:16 but shun profan and vain babblings: for they will increas unto
more ungodli

2:17 and their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is hymenaeu
and philetus; 2:18 who concern the truth have er say that
the resurrect is past already; and overthrow the faith of some

2:19 nevertheless the foundat of god standeth sure have thi
seal the lord knoweth them that are hi and let everi one that
nameth the name of christ depart from iniqu

2:20 but in a great hous there are not onli vessel of gold and of
silver but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour and some to
dishonour

2:21 if a man therefor purg himself from these he shall be a vessel
unto honour sanctifi and meet for the master use and prepar
unto everi good work

2:22 flee also youth lusts: but follow righteous faith
chariti peac with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart

2:23 but foolish and unlearn question avoid know that they do
gender strife

2:24 and the servant of the lord must not strive; but be gentl unto
all men apt to teach patient 2:25 in meek instruct those
that oppos themselves; if god peradventur will give them repent
to the acknowledg of the truth; 2:26 and that they may recov
themselv out of the snare of the devil who are taken captiv by him
at hi will

3:1 thi know also that in the last day peril time shall come

3:2 for men shall be lover of their own selv covet boaster
proud blasphem disobedi to parent unthank unholi 3:3
without natur affect trucebreak fals accus incontin
fierc despis of those that are good 3:4 traitor headi
highmind lover of pleasur more than lover of god; 3:5 have a

3:6 for of thi sort are they which creep into hous and lead
captiv silli women laden with sin led away with diver lust 3:7
ever learn and never abl to come to the knowledg of the truth

3:8 now as jann and jambr withstood mose so do these also resist
the truth: men of corrupt mind reprob concern the faith

3:9 but they shall proceed no further: for their folli shall be
manifest unto all men as their also wa

3:10 but thou hast fulli known my doctrin manner of life purpos
faith longsuff chariti patienc 3:11 persecut
afflict which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra;
what persecut i endured: but out of them all the lord deliv
me

3:12 yea and all that will live godli in christ jesu shall suffer
persecut

3:13 but evil men and seduc shall wax wors and wors deceiv
and be deceiv

3:14 but continu thou in the thing which thou hast learn and hast
been assur of know of whom thou hast learn them; 3:15 and that
from a child thou hast known the holi scriptur which are abl to
make thee wise unto salvat through faith which is in christ jesu

3:16 all scriptur is given by inspir of god and is profit
for doctrin for reproof for correct for instruct in
righteousness: 3:17 that the man of god may be perfect throughli
furnish unto all good work

4:1 i charg thee therefor befor god and the lord jesu christ who
shall judg the quick and the dead at hi appear and hi kingdom;
4:2 preach the word; be instant in season out of season; reprov
rebuk exhort with all longsuff and doctrin

4:3 for the time will come when they will not endur sound doctrine;
but after their own lust shall they heap to themselv teacher
have itch ears; 4:4 and they shall turn away their ear from the
truth and shall be turn unto fabl

4:5 but watch thou in all thing endur afflict do the work of

1:1 paul a prison of jesu christ and timothi our brother unto

belov apphia and archippu our fellowsoldi and to the church in

that which is conveni 1:9 yet for love sake i rather beseech

jesu christ

1:10 i beseech thee for my son onesimu whom i have begotten in my

the epistl of paul the apostl to the hebrew


1:1 god who at sundri time and in diver manner spake in time past
unto the father by the prophet 1:2 hath in these last day spoken
unto us by hi son whom he hath appoint heir of all thing by whom
also he made the worlds; 1:3 who be the bright of hi glori
and the express imag of hi person and uphold all thing by the
word of hi power when he had by himself purg our sin sat down on
the right hand of the majesti on high: 1:4 be made so much better
than the angel as he hath by inherit obtain a more excel
name than they

1:5 for unto which of the angel said he at ani time thou art my son
thi day have i begotten thee? and again i will be to him a father
and he shall be to me a son? 1:6 and again when he bringeth in the
firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angel of god
worship him

1:7 and of the angel he saith who maketh hi angel spirit and hi
minist a flame of fire

1:8 but unto the son he saith thi throne o god is for ever and
ever: a sceptr of righteous is the sceptr of thi kingdom

1:9 thou hast love righteous and hate iniquity; therefor god
even thi god hath anoint thee with the oil of glad abov thi
fellow

1:10 and thou lord in the begin hast laid the foundat of the
earth; and the heaven are the work of thine hands: 1:11 they shall
perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment; 1:12 and as a vestur shalt thou fold them up and they shall
be changed: but thou art the same and thi year shall not fail

1:13 but to which of the angel said he at ani time sit on my right
hand until i make thine enemi thi footstool? 1:14 are they not all
minist spirit sent forth to minist for them who shall be
heir of salvation? 2:1 therefor we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the thing which we have heard lest at ani time we should let
them slip

2:2 for if the word spoken by angel wa stedfast and everi
transgress and disobedi receiv a just recomp of reward;
2:3 how shall we escap if we neglect so great salvation; which at
the first began to be spoken by the lord and wa confirm unto us by
them that heard him; 2:4 god also bear them wit both with
sign and wonder and with diver miracl and gift of the holi
ghost accord to hi own will? 2:5 for unto the angel hath he not
put in subject the world to come whereof we speak

2:6 but one in a certain place testifi say what is man that
thou art mind of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
2:7 thou madest him a littl lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
with glori and honour and didst set him over the work of thi hands:
2:8 thou hast put all thing in subject under hi feet for in that
he put all in subject under him he left noth that is not put
under him

but now we see not yet all thing put under him

2:9 but we see jesu who wa made a littl lower than the angel for
the suffer of death crown with glori and honour; that he by the
grace of god should tast death for everi man

2:10 for it becam him for whom are all thing and by whom are all
thing in bring mani son unto glori to make the captain of their
salvat perfect through suffer

2:11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctifi are all
of one: for which caus he is not asham to call them brethren 2:12
say i will declar thi name unto my brethren in the midst of the
church will i sing prais unto thee

2:13 and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and
the children which god hath given me

2:14 forasmuch then as the children are partak of flesh and blood
he also himself likewis took part of the same; that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil;
2:15 and deliv them who through fear of death were all their
lifetim subject to bondag

2:16 for verili he took not on him the natur of angels; but he took
on him the seed of abraham

2:17 wherefor in all thing it behov him to be made like unto hi
brethren that he might be a merci and faith high priest in
thing pertain to god to make reconcili for the sin of the
peopl

2:18 for in that he himself hath suffer be tempt he is abl to
succour them that are tempt

3:1 wherefor holi brethren partak of the heavenli call
consid the apostl and high priest of our profess christ jesus;
3:2 who wa faith to him that appoint him as also mose wa
faith in all hi hous

3:3 for thi man wa count worthi of more glori than mose inasmuch
as he who hath build the hous hath more honour than the hous

3:4 for everi hous is build by some man; but he that built all
thing is god

3:5 and mose verili wa faith in all hi hous as a servant for
a testimoni of those thing which were to be spoken after; 3:6 but
christ as a son over hi own house; whose hous are we if we hold
fast the confid and the rejoic of the hope firm unto the end

3:7 wherefor (a the holi ghost saith to day if ye will hear hi
voic 3:8 harden not your heart as in the provoc in the day
of temptat in the wilderness: 3:9 when your father tempt me
prove me and saw my work forti year

3:10 wherefor i wa griev with that gener and said they do
alway err in their heart; and they have not known my way

3:11 so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest) 3:12
take heed brethren lest there be in ani of you an evil heart of
unbelief in depart from the live god

3:13 but exhort one anoth daili while it is call to day; lest ani
of you be harden through the deceit of sin

3:14 for we are made partak of christ if we hold the begin of
our confid stedfast unto the end; 3:15 while it is said to day if
ye will hear hi voic harden not your heart as in the provoc

3:16 for some when they had heard did provoke: howbeit not all that
came out of egypt by mose

3:17 but with whom wa he griev forti years? wa it not with them
that had sin whose carcas fell in the wilderness? 3:18 and to
whom sware he that they should not enter into hi rest but to them
that believ not? 3:19 so we see that they could not enter in
becaus of unbelief

4:1 let us therefor fear lest a promis be left us of enter
into hi rest ani of you should seem to come short of it

4:2 for unto us wa the gospel preach as well as unto them: but the
word preach did not profit them not be mix with faith in them
that heard it

4:3 for we which have believ do enter into rest as he said as i
have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest: although the
work were finish from the foundat of the world

4:4 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on thi wise
and god did rest the seventh day from all hi work

4:5 and in thi place again if they shall enter into my rest

4:6 see therefor it remaineth that some must enter therein and
they to whom it wa first preach enter not in becaus of unbelief:
4:7 again he limiteth a certain day say in david to day after
so long a time; as it is said to day if ye will hear hi voic
harden not your heart

4:8 for if jesu had given them rest then would he not afterward have
spoken of anoth day

4:9 there remaineth therefor a rest to the peopl of god

4:10 for he that is enter into hi rest he also hath ceas from
hi own work as god did from hi

4:11 let us labour therefor to enter into that rest lest ani man
fall after the same exampl of unbelief

4:12 for the word of god is quick and power and sharper than ani
twoedg sword pierc even to the divid asund of soul and
spirit and of the joint and marrow and is a discern of the
thought and intent of the heart

4:13 neither is there ani creatur that is not manifest in hi sight:
but all thing are nake and open unto the eye of him with whom we
have to do

4:14 see then that we have a great high priest that is pass into
the heaven jesu the son of god let us hold fast our profess

4:15 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touch with the
feel of our infirmities; but wa in all point tempt like as we
are yet without sin

4:16 let us therefor come boldli unto the throne of grace that we
may obtain merci and find grace to help in time of need

5:1 for everi high priest taken from among men is ordain for men in
thing pertain to god that he may offer both gift and sacrific
for sins: 5:2 who can have compass on the ignor and on them
that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compass with
infirm

5:3 and by reason hereof he ought as for the peopl so also for
himself to offer for sin

5:4 and no man taketh thi honour unto himself but he that is call
of god as wa aaron

5:5 so also christ glorifi not himself to be made an high priest;
but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten
thee

5:6 as he saith also in anoth place thou art a priest for ever
after the order of melchisedec

5:7 who in the day of hi flesh when he had offer up prayer and
supplic with strong cri and tear unto him that wa abl to
save him from death and wa heard in that he feared; 5:8 though he
were a son yet learn he obedi by the thing which he suffered;
5:9 and be made perfect he becam the author of etern salvat
unto all them that obey him; 5:10 call of god an high priest after
the order of melchisedec

5:11 of whom we have mani thing to say and hard to be utter
see ye are dull of hear

5:12 for when for the time ye ought to be teacher ye have need that
one teach you again which be the first principl of the oracl of
god; and are becom such as have need of milk and not of strong meat

5:13 for everi one that useth milk is unskil in the word of
righteousness: for he is a babe

5:14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even
those who by reason of use have their sens exercis to discern both
good and evil

6:1 therefor leav the principl of the doctrin of christ let us
go on unto perfection; not lay again the foundat of repent
from dead work and of faith toward god 6:2 of the doctrin of
baptism and of lay on of hand and of resurrect of the dead
and of etern judgment

6:3 and thi will we do if god permit

6:4 for it is imposs for those who were onc enlighten and have
tast of the heavenli gift and were made partak of the holi
ghost 6:5 and have tast the good word of god and the power of the
world to come 6:6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto
repentance; see they crucifi to themselv the son of god afresh
and put him to an open shame

6:7 for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it
and bringeth forth herb meet for them by whom it is dress
receiveth bless from god: 6:8 but that which beareth thorn and
brier is reject and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be
burn

6:9 but belov we are persuad better thing of you and thing
that accompani salvat though we thu speak

6:10 for god is not unright to forget your work and labour of
love which ye have shew toward hi name in that ye have minist
to the saint and do minist

6:11 and we desir that everi one of you do shew the same dilig to
the full assur of hope unto the end: 6:12 that ye be not sloth
but follow of them who through faith and patienc inherit the
promis

6:13 for when god made promis to abraham becaus he could swear by
no greater he sware by himself 6:14 say sure bless i will
bless thee and multipli i will multipli thee

6:15 and so after he had patient endur he obtain the promis

6:16 for men verili swear by the greater: and an oath for confirm
is to them an end of all strife

6:17 wherein god will more abundantli to shew unto the heir of
promis the immut of hi counsel confirm it by an oath: 6:18
that by two immut thing in which it wa imposs for god to
lie we might have a strong consol who have fled for refug to
lay hold upon the hope set befor us: 6:19 which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into
that within the veil; 6:20 whither the forerunn is for us enter
even jesu made an high priest for ever after the order of
melchisedec

7:1 for thi melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god
who met abraham return from the slaughter of the king and bless
him; 7:2 to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all; first be by
interpret king of righteous and after that also king of
salem which is king of peace; 7:3 without father without mother
without descent have neither begin of day nor end of life;
but made like unto the son of god; abideth a priest continu

7:4 now consid how great thi man wa unto whom even the patriarch
abraham gave the tenth of the spoil

7:5 and verili they that are of the son of levi who receiv the
offic of the priesthood have a command to take tith of the
peopl accord to the law that is of their brethren though they
come out of the loin of abraham: 7:6 but he whose descent is not
count from them receiv tith of abraham and bless him that had
the promis

7:7 and without all contradict the less is bless of the better

7:8 and here men that die receiv tithes; but there he receiveth them
of whom it is wit that he liveth

7:9 and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tith pay tith
in abraham

7:10 for he wa yet in the loin of hi father when melchisedec met
him

7:11 if therefor perfect were by the levit priesthood (for
under it the peopl receiv the law) what further need wa there
that anoth priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and
not be call after the order of aaron? 7:12 for the priesthood be
chang there is made of necess a chang also of the law

7:13 for he of whom these thing are spoken pertaineth to anoth
tribe of which no man gave attend at the altar

7:14 for it is evid that our lord sprang out of juda; of which
tribe mose spake noth concern priesthood

7:15 and it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitud of
melchisedec there ariseth anoth priest 7:16 who is made not after
the law of a carnal command but after the power of an endless
life

7:17 for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of
melchisedec

7:18 for there is verili a disannul of the command go
befor for the weak and unprofit thereof

7:19 for the law made noth perfect but the bring in of a better
hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto god

7:20 and inasmuch as not without an oath he wa made priest: 7:21 (for
those priest were made without an oath; but thi with an oath by him
that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a
priest for ever after the order of melchisedec:) 7:22 by so much wa
jesu made a sureti of a better testament

7:23 and they truli were mani priest becaus they were not suffer
to continu by reason of death: 7:24 but thi man becaus he
continueth ever hath an unchang priesthood

7:25 wherefor he is abl also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto god by him see he ever liveth to make intercess for them

7:26 for such an high priest becam us who is holi harmless
undefil separ from sinner and made higher than the heavens;
7:27 who needeth not daili as those high priest to offer up
sacrific first for hi own sin and then for the peoples: for thi
he did onc when he offer up himself

7:28 for the law maketh men high priest which have infirmity; but the
word of the oath which wa sinc the law maketh the son who is
consecr for evermor

8:1 now of the thing which we have spoken thi is the sum: we have
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
majesti in the heavens; 8:2 a minist of the sanctuari and of the
true tabernacl which the lord pitch and not man

8:3 for everi high priest is ordain to offer gift and sacrifices:
wherefor it is of necess that thi man have somewhat also to
offer

8:4 for if he were on earth he should not be a priest see that
there are priest that offer gift accord to the law: 8:5 who serv
unto the exampl and shadow of heavenli thing as mose wa
admonish of god when he wa about to make the tabernacle: for see
saith he that thou make all thing accord to the pattern shew to
thee in the mount

8:6 but now hath he obtain a more excel ministri by how much
also he is the mediat of a better coven which wa establish
upon better promis

8:7 for if that first coven had been faultless then should no
place have been sought for the second

8:8 for find fault with them he saith behold the day come
saith the lord when i will make a new coven with the hous of
israel and with the hous of judah: 8:9 not accord to the coven
that i made with their father in the day when i took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of egypt; becaus they continu not in
my coven and i regard them not saith the lord

8:10 for thi is the coven that i will make with the hous of
israel after those day saith the lord; i will put my law into their
mind and write them in their hearts: and i will be to them a god and
they shall be to me a people: 8:11 and they shall not teach everi man
hi neighbour and everi man hi brother say know the lord: for
all shall know me from the least to the greatest

8:12 for i will be merci to their unright and their sin
and their iniqu will i rememb no more

8:13 in that he saith a new coven he hath made the first old now
that which decayeth and waxeth old is readi to vanish away

9:1 then verili the first coven had also ordin of divin
servic and a worldli sanctuari

9:2 for there wa a tabernacl made; the first wherein wa the
candlestick and the tabl and the shewbread; which is call the
sanctuari

9:3 and after the second veil the tabernacl which is call the
holiest of all; 9:4 which had the golden censer and the ark of the
coven overlaid round about with gold wherein wa the golden pot
that had manna and aaron rod that bud and the tabl of the
covenant; 9:5 and over it the cherubim of glori shadow the
mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularli

9:6 now when these thing were thu ordain the priest went alway
into the first tabernacl accomplish the servic of god

9:7 but into the second went the high priest alon onc everi year
not without blood which he offer for himself and for the error of
the people: 9:8 the holi ghost thi signifi that the way into the
holiest of all wa not yet made manifest while as the first
tabernacl wa yet standing: 9:9 which wa a figur for the time then
present in which were offer both gift and sacrific that could
not make him that did the servic perfect as pertain to the
conscience; 9:10 which stood onli in meat and drink and diver
wash and carnal ordin impos on them until the time of
reform

9:11 but christ be come an high priest of good thing to come by a
greater and more perfect tabernacl not made with hand that is to
say not of thi building; 9:12 neither by the blood of goat and
calv but by hi own blood he enter in onc into the holi place
have obtain etern redempt for us

9:13 for if the blood of bull and of goat and the ash of an
heifer sprinkl the unclean sanctifieth to the purifi of the
flesh: 9:14 how much more shall the blood of christ who through the
etern spirit offer himself without spot to god purg your
conscienc from dead work to serv the live god? 9:15 and for thi
caus he is the mediat of the new testament that by mean of death
for the redempt of the transgress that were under the first
testament they which are call might receiv the promis of etern
inherit

9:16 for where a testament is there must also of necess be the
death of the testat

9:17 for a testament is of forc after men are dead: otherwis it is
of no strength at all while the testat liveth

9:18 whereupon neither the first testament wa dedic without
blood

9:19 for when mose had spoken everi precept to all the peopl
accord to the law he took the blood of calv and of goat with
water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkl both the book and
all the peopl 9:20 say thi is the blood of the testament which
god hath enjoin unto you

9:21 moreov he sprinkl with blood both the tabernacl and all the
vessel of the ministri

9:22 and almost all thing are by the law purg with blood; and
without shed of blood is no remiss

9:23 it wa therefor necessari that the pattern of thing in the
heaven should be purifi with these; but the heavenli thing
themselv with better sacrific than these

9:24 for christ is not enter into the holi place made with hand
which are the figur of the true; but into heaven itself now to
appear in the presenc of god for us: 9:25 nor yet that he should
offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holi place
everi year with blood of others; 9:26 for then must he often have
suffer sinc the foundat of the world: but now onc in the end of
the world hath he appear to put away sin by the sacrific of
himself

9:27 and as it is appoint unto men onc to die but after thi the
judgment: 9:28 so christ wa onc offer to bear the sin of many;
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time
without sin unto salvat

10:1 for the law have a shadow of good thing to come and not the
veri imag of the thing can never with those sacrific which they
offer year by year continu make the comer thereunto perfect

10:2 for then would they not have ceas to be offered? becaus that
the worshipp onc purg should have had no more conscienc of
sin

10:3 but in those sacrific there is a remembr again made of sin
everi year

10:4 for it is not possibl that the blood of bull and of goat
should take away sin

10:5 wherefor when he cometh into the world he saith sacrific and
offer thou wouldest not but a bodi hast thou prepar me: 10:6 in
burnt offer and sacrific for sin thou hast had no pleasur

10:7 then said i lo i come (in the volum of the book it is written
of me) to do thi will o god

10:8 abov when he said sacrific and offer and burnt offer
and offer for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasur
therein; which are offer by the law; 10:9 then said he lo i come
to do thi will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish
the second

10:10 by the which will we are sanctifi through the offer of the
bodi of jesu christ onc for all

10:11 and everi priest standeth daili minist and offer
oftentim the same sacrific which can never take away sins: 10:12
but thi man after he had offer one sacrific for sin for ever
sat down on the right hand of god; 10:13 from henceforth expect
till hi enemi be made hi footstool

10:14 for by one offer he hath perfect for ever them that are
sanctifi

10:15 whereof the holi ghost also is a wit to us: for after that
he had said befor 10:16 thi is the coven that i will make with
them after those day saith the lord i will put my law into their
heart and in their mind will i write them; 10:17 and their sin and
iniqu will i rememb no more

10:18 now where remiss of these is there is no more offer for
sin

10:19 have therefor brethren bold to enter into the holiest
by the blood of jesu 10:20 by a new and live way which he hath
consecr for us through the veil that is to say hi flesh; 10:21
and have an high priest over the hous of god; 10:22 let us draw
near with a true heart in full assur of faith have our heart
sprinkl from an evil conscienc and our bodi wash with pure
water

10:23 let us hold fast the profess of our faith without wavering;
(for he is faith that promised;) 10:24 and let us consid one
anoth to provok unto love and to good works: 10:25 not forsak
the assembl of ourselv togeth as the manner of some is; but
exhort one another: and so much the more as ye see the day
approach

10:26 for if we sin wil after that we have receiv the knowledg
of the truth there remaineth no more sacrific for sin 10:27 but a
certain fear look for of judgment and fieri indign which
shall devour the adversari

10:28 he that despis mose law die without merci under two or
three witnesses: 10:29 of how much sorer punish suppos ye shall
he be thought worthi who hath trodden under foot the son of god and
hath count the blood of the coven wherewith he wa sanctifi
an unholi thing and hath done despit unto the spirit of grace?
10:30 for we know him that hath said vengeanc belongeth unto me i
will recompens saith the lord and again the lord shall judg hi
peopl

10:31 it is a fear thing to fall into the hand of the live god

10:32 but call to remembr the former day in which after ye were
illumin ye endur a great fight of afflictions; 10:33 partli
whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproach and afflictions;
and partli whilst ye becam companion of them that were so use

10:34 for ye had compass of me in my bond and took joy the
spoil of your good know in yourselv that ye have in heaven a
better and an endur substanc

10:35 cast not away therefor your confid which hath great
recomp of reward

10:36 for ye have need of patienc that after ye have done the will
of god ye might receiv the promis

10:37 for yet a littl while and he that shall come will come and
will not tarri

10:38 now the just shall live by faith: but if ani man draw back my
soul shall have no pleasur in him

10:39 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
that believ to the save of the soul

11:1 now faith is the substanc of thing hope for the evid of
thing not seen

11:2 for by it the elder obtain a good report

11:3 through faith we understand that the world were frame by the
word of god so that thing which are seen were not made of thing
which do appear

11:4 by faith abel offer unto god a more excel sacrific than
cain by which he obtain wit that he wa righteou god
testifi of hi gifts: and by it he be dead yet speaketh

11:5 by faith enoch wa translat that he should not see death; and
wa not found becaus god had translat him: for befor hi
translat he had thi testimoni that he pleas god

11:6 but without faith it is imposs to pleas him: for he that
cometh to god must believ that he is and that he is a reward of
them that dilig seek him

11:7 by faith noah be warn of god of thing not seen as yet
move with fear prepar an ark to the save of hi house; by the
which he condemn the world and becam heir of the righteous
which is by faith

11:8 by faith abraham when he wa call to go out into a place which
he should after receiv for an inherit obeyed; and he went out
not know whither he went

11:9 by faith he sojourn in the land of promis as in a strang
countri dwell in tabernacl with isaac and jacob the heir with
him of the same promise: 11:10 for he look for a citi which hath
foundat whose builder and maker is god

11:11 through faith also sara herself receiv strength to conceiv
seed and wa deliv of a child when she wa past age becaus she
judg him faith who had promis

11:12 therefor sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so
mani as the star of the sky in multitud and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumer

11:13 these all die in faith not have receiv the promis but
have seen them afar off and were persuad of them and embrac
them and confess that they were stranger and pilgrim on the
earth

11:14 for they that say such thing declar plainli that they seek a
countri

11:15 and truli if they had been mind of that countri from whenc
they came out they might have had opportun to have return

11:16 but now they desir a better countri that is an heavenly:
wherefor god is not asham to be call their god: for he hath
prepar for them a citi

11:17 by faith abraham when he wa tri offer up isaac: and he
that had receiv the promis offer up hi onli begotten son 11:18
of whom it wa said that in isaac shall thi seed be called: 11:19
account that god wa abl to rais him up even from the dead; from
whenc also he receiv him in a figur

11:20 by faith isaac bless jacob and esau concern thing to come

11:21 by faith jacob when he wa a die bless both the son of
joseph; and worship lean upon the top of hi staff

11:22 by faith joseph when he die made mention of the depart of
the children of israel; and gave command concern hi bone

11:23 by faith mose when he wa born wa hid three month of hi
parent becaus they saw he wa a proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king command

11:24 by faith mose when he wa come to year refus to be call
the son of pharaoh daughter; 11:25 choos rather to suffer
afflict with the peopl of god than to enjoy the pleasur of sin
for a season; 11:26 esteem the reproach of christ greater rich
than the treasur in egypt: for he had respect unto the recomp of
the reward

11:27 by faith he forsook egypt not fear the wrath of the king:
for he endur as see him who is invis

11:28 through faith he kept the passov and the sprinkl of blood
lest he that destroy the firstborn should touch them

11:29 by faith they pass through the red sea as by dri land: which
the egyptian assay to do were drown

11:30 by faith the wall of jericho fell down after they were
compass about seven day

11:31 by faith the harlot rahab perish not with them that believ
not when she had receiv the spi with peac

11:32 and what shall i more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae; of david also
and samuel and of the prophets: 11:33 who through faith subdu
kingdom wrought righteous obtain promis stop the mouth
of lion

11:34 quench the violenc of fire escap the edg of the sword
out of weak were made strong wax valiant in fight turn to
flight the armi of the alien

11:35 women receiv their dead rais to life again: and other were
tortur not accept deliverance; that they might obtain a better
resurrection: 11:36 and other had trial of cruel mock and
scourg yea moreov of bond and imprisonment: 11:37 they were
stone they were sawn asund were tempt were slain with the
sword: they wander about in sheepskin and goatskins; be
destitut afflict tormented; 11:38 (of whom the world wa not
worthy:) they wander in desert and in mountain and in den and
cave of the earth

11:39 and these all have obtain a good report through faith
receiv not the promise: 11:40 god have provid some better thing
for us that they without us should not be made perfect

12:1 wherefor see we also are compass about with so great a
cloud of wit let us lay asid everi weight and the sin which
doth so easili beset us and let us run with patienc the race that is
set befor us 12:2 look unto jesu the author and finish of our
faith; who for the joy that wa set befor him endur the cross
despis the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of god

12:3 for consid him that endur such contradict of sinner
against himself lest ye be weari and faint in your mind

12:4 ye have not yet resist unto blood strive against sin

12:5 and ye have forgotten the exhort which speaketh unto you as
unto children my son despis not thou the chasten of the lord
nor faint when thou art rebuk of him: 12:6 for whom the lord loveth
he chasteneth and scourgeth everi son whom he receiveth

12:7 if ye endur chasten god dealeth with you as with sons; for
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 12:8 but if ye be
without chastis whereof all are partak then are ye bastard
and not son

12:9 furthermor we have had father of our flesh which correct us
and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subject
unto the father of spirit and live? 12:10 for they verili for a few
day chasten us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit
that we might be partak of hi holi

12:11 now no chasten for the present seemeth to be joyou but
grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceabl fruit of
righteous unto them which are exercis therebi

12:12 wherefor lift up the hand which hang down and the feebl
knees; 12:13 and make straight path for your feet lest that which is
lame be turn out of the way; but let it rather be heal

12:14 follow peac with all men and holi without which no man
shall see the lord: 12:15 look dilig lest ani man fail of the
grace of god; lest ani root of bitter spring up troubl you
and therebi mani be defiled; 12:16 lest there be ani fornic or
profan person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold hi
birthright

12:17 for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherit the
bless he wa rejected: for he found no place of repent though
he sought it care with tear

12:18 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touch and
that burn with fire nor unto black and dark and tempest
12:19 and the sound of a trumpet and the voic of words; which voic
they that heard intreat that the word should not be spoken to them
ani more: 12:20 (for they could not endur that which wa command
and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stone or
thrust through with a dart: 12:21 and so terribl wa the sight that
mose said i exceedingli fear and quake:) 12:22 but ye are come unto
mount sion and unto the citi of the live god the heavenli
jerusalem and to an innumer compani of angel 12:23 to the
gener assembl and church of the firstborn which are written in
heaven and to god the judg of all and to the spirit of just men
made perfect 12:24 and to jesu the mediat of the new coven and
to the blood of sprinkl that speaketh better thing than that of
abel

12:25 see that ye refus not him that speaketh for if they escap
not who refus him that spake on earth much more shall not we
escap if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 12:26
whose voic then shook the earth: but now he hath promis say
yet onc more i shake not the earth onli but also heaven

12:27 and thi word yet onc more signifieth the remov of those
thing that are shaken as of thing that are made that those thing
which cannot be shaken may remain

12:28 wherefor we receiv a kingdom which cannot be move let us
have grace wherebi we may serv god accept with rever and
godli fear: 12:29 for our god is a consum fire

13:1 let brotherli love continu

13:2 be not forget to entertain strangers: for therebi some have
entertain angel unawar

13:3 rememb them that are in bond as bound with them; and them
which suffer advers as be yourselv also in the bodi

13:4 marriag is honour in all and the bed undefiled: but
whoremong and adulter god will judg

13:5 let your convers be without covetousness; and be content
with such thing as ye have: for he hath said i will never leav
thee nor forsak thee

13:6 so that we may boldli say the lord is my helper and i will not
fear what man shall do unto me

13:7 rememb them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto
you the word of god: whose faith follow consid the end of their
convers

13:8 jesu christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever

13:9 be not carri about with diver and strang doctrin for it is
a good thing that the heart be establish with grace; not with meat
which have not profit them that have been occupi therein

13:10 we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serv
the tabernacl

13:11 for the bodi of those beast whose blood is brought into the
sanctuari by the high priest for sin are burn without the camp

13:12 wherefor jesu also that he might sanctifi the peopl with hi
own blood suffer without the gate

13:13 let us go forth therefor unto him without the camp bear hi
reproach

13:14 for here have we no continu citi but we seek one to come

13:15 by him therefor let us offer the sacrific of prais to god
continu that is the fruit of our lip give thank to hi name

13:16 but to do good and to commun forget not: for with such
sacrific god is well pleas

13:17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves:
for they watch for your soul as they that must give account that
they may do it with joy and not with grief: for that is unprofit
for you

13:18 pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscienc in all
thing will to live honestli

13:19 but i beseech you the rather to do thi that i may be restor
to you the sooner

13:20 now the god of peac that brought again from the dead our lord
jesu that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the
everlast coven 13:21 make you perfect in everi good work to do
hi will work in you that which is wellpleas in hi sight
through jesu christ; to whom be glori for ever and ever amen

13:22 and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation: for
i have written a letter unto you in few word

13:23 know ye that our brother timothi is set at liberty; with whom
if he come shortli i will see you

13:24 salut all them that have the rule over you and all the saint

they of itali salut you

13:25 grace be with you all amen




the gener epistl of jame


1:1 jame a servant of god and of the lord jesu christ
to the twelv tribe which are scatter abroad greet

1:2 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diver
temptations; 1:3 know thi that the tri of your faith worketh
patienc

1:4 but let patienc have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and
entir want noth

1:5 if ani of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all
men liber and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him

1:6 but let him ask in faith noth waver for he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss

1:7 for let not that man think that he shall receiv ani thing of the
lord

1:8 a doubl mind man is unstabl in all hi way

1:9 let the brother of low degre rejoic in that he is exalted: 1:10
but the rich in that he is made low: becaus as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away

1:11 for the sun is no sooner risen with a burn heat but it
withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of
the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in
hi way

1:12 bless is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
tri he shall receiv the crown of life which the lord hath
promis to them that love him

1:13 let no man say when he is tempt i am tempt of god: for god
cannot be tempt with evil neither tempteth he ani man: 1:14 but
everi man is tempt when he is drawn away of hi own lust and
entic

1:15 then when lust hath conceiv it bringeth forth sin: and sin
when it is finish bringeth forth death

1:16 do not err my belov brethren

1:17 everi good gift and everi perfect gift is from abov and cometh
down from the father of light with whom is no variabl neither
shadow of turn

1:18 of hi own will begat he us with the word of truth that we
should be a kind of firstfruit of hi creatur

1:19 wherefor my belov brethren let everi man be swift to hear
slow to speak slow to wrath: 1:20 for the wrath of man worketh not
the righteous of god

1:21 wherefor lay apart all filthi and superflu of
naughti and receiv with meek the engraft word which is
abl to save your soul

1:22 but be ye doer of the word and not hearer onli deceiv your
own selv

1:23 for if ani be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like
unto a man behold hi natur face in a glass: 1:24 for he
beholdeth himself and goeth hi way and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he wa

1:25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberti and continueth
therein he be not a forget hearer but a doer of the work thi
man shall be bless in hi deed

1:26 if ani man among you seem to be religi and bridleth not hi
tongu but deceiveth hi own heart thi man religion is vain

1:27 pure religion and undefil befor god and the father is thi to
visit the fatherless and widow in their afflict and to keep
himself unspot from the world

2:1 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesu christ the lord
of glori with respect of person

2:2 for if there come unto your assembl a man with a gold ring in
goodli apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 2:3
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay cloth and say unto
him sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor stand thou
there or sit here under my footstool: 2:4 are ye not then partial in
yourselv and are becom judg of evil thoughts? 2:5 hearken my
belov brethren hath not god chosen the poor of thi world rich in
faith and heir of the kingdom which he hath promis to them that
love him? 2:6 but ye have despis the poor do not rich men oppress
you and draw you befor the judgment seats? 2:7 do not they
blasphem that worthi name by the which ye are called? 2:8 if ye
fulfil the royal law accord to the scriptur thou shalt love thi
neighbour as thyself ye do well: 2:9 but if ye have respect to
person ye commit sin and are convinc of the law as transgressor

2:10 for whosoev shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
point he is guilti of all

2:11 for he that said do not commit adulteri said also do not kill
now if thou commit no adulteri yet if thou kill thou art becom a
transgressor of the law

2:12 so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judg by the law
of liberti

2:13 for he shall have judgment without merci that hath shew no
mercy; and merci rejoiceth against judgment

2:14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith
and have not works? can faith save him? 2:15 if a brother or sister
be nake and destitut of daili food 2:16 and one of you say unto
them depart in peac be ye warm and filled; notwithstand ye
give them not those thing which are need to the body; what doth it
profit? 2:17 even so faith if it hath not work is dead be
alon

2:18 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works: shew me
thi faith without thi work and i will shew thee my faith by my
work

2:19 thou believest that there is one god; thou doest well: the devil
also believ and trembl

2:20 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without work is dead?
2:21 wa not abraham our father justifi by work when he had
offer isaac hi son upon the altar? 2:22 seest thou how faith
wrought with hi work and by work wa faith made perfect? 2:23 and
the scriptur wa fulfil which saith abraham believ god and it
wa imput unto him for righteousness: and he wa call the friend
of god

2:24 ye see then how that by work a man is justifi and not by
faith onli

2:25 likewis also wa not rahab the harlot justifi by work when
she had receiv the messeng and had sent them out anoth way?
2:26 for as the bodi without the spirit is dead so faith without
work is dead also

3:1 my brethren be not mani master know that we shall receiv
the greater condemn

3:2 for in mani thing we offend all if ani man offend not in word
the same is a perfect man and abl also to bridl the whole bodi

3:3 behold we put bit in the hors mouth that they may obey us;
and we turn about their whole bodi

3:4 behold also the ship which though they be so great and are
driven of fierc wind yet are they turn about with a veri small
helm whithersoev the governor listeth

3:5 even so the tongu is a littl member and boasteth great thing

behold how great a matter a littl fire kindleth! 3:6 and the tongu
is a fire a world of iniquity: so is the tongu among our member
that it defileth the whole bodi and setteth on fire the cours of
nature; and it is set on fire of hell

3:7 for everi kind of beast and of bird and of serpent and of
thing in the sea is tame and hath been tame of mankind: 3:8 but
the tongu can no man tame; it is an unruli evil full of deadli
poison

3:9 therewith bless we god even the father; and therewith curs we
men which are made after the similitud of god

3:10 out of the same mouth proceedeth bless and curs my
brethren these thing ought not so to be

3:11 doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
bitter? 3:12 can the fig tree my brethren bear oliv berries?
either a vine figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
fresh

3:13 who is a wise man and endu with knowledg among you? let him
shew out of a good convers hi work with meek of wisdom

3:14 but if ye have bitter envi and strife in your heart glori
not and lie not against the truth

3:15 thi wisdom descendeth not from abov but is earthli sensual
devilish

3:16 for where envi and strife is there is confus and everi
evil work

3:17 but the wisdom that is from abov is first pure then peaceabl
gentl and easi to be intreat full of merci and good fruit
without partial and without hypocrisi

3:18 and the fruit of righteous is sown in peac of them that make
peac

4:1 from whenc come war and fight among you? come they not
henc even of your lust that war in your members? 4:2 ye lust and
have not: ye kill and desir to have and cannot obtain: ye fight and
war yet ye have not becaus ye ask not

4:3 ye ask and receiv not becaus ye ask amiss that ye may consum
it upon your lust

4:4 ye adulter and adulteress know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmiti with god? whosoev therefor will be a friend of
the world is the enemi of god

4:5 do ye think that the scriptur saith in vain the spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? 4:6 but he giveth more grace
wherefor he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the
humbl

4:7 submit yourselv therefor to god resist the devil and he will
flee from you

4:8 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleans your
hand ye sinners; and purifi your heart ye doubl mind

4:9 be afflict and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turn to
mourn and your joy to heavi

4:10 humbl yourselv in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you
up

4:11 speak not evil one of anoth brethren he that speaketh evil of
hi brother and judgeth hi brother speaketh evil of the law and
judgeth the law: but if thou judg the law thou art not a doer of the
law but a judg

4:12 there is one lawgiv who is abl to save and to destroy: who
art thou that judgest another? 4:13 go to now ye that say to day or
to morrow we will go into such a citi and continu there a year and
buy and sell and get gain: 4:14 wherea ye know not what shall be on
the morrow for what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth
for a littl time and then vanisheth away

4:15 for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do
thi or that

4:16 but now ye rejoic in your boastings: all such rejoic is evil

4:17 therefor to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
him it is sin

5:1 go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseri that shall
come upon you

5:2 your rich are corrupt and your garment are motheaten

5:3 your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
wit against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have
heap treasur togeth for the last day

5:4 behold the hire of the labour who have reap down your
field which is of you kept back by fraud crieth: and the cri of
them which have reap are enter into the ear of the lord of
sabaoth

5:5 ye have live in pleasur on the earth and been wanton; ye have
nourish your heart as in a day of slaughter

5:6 ye have condemn and kill the just; and he doth not resist you

5:7 be patient therefor brethren unto the come of the lord

behold the husbandman waiteth for the preciou fruit of the earth
and hath long patienc for it until he receiv the earli and latter
rain

5:8 be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the come of the
lord draweth nigh

5:9 grudg not one against anoth brethren lest ye be condemned:
behold the judg standeth befor the door

5:10 take my brethren the prophet who have spoken in the name of
the lord for an exampl of suffer afflict and of patienc

5:11 behold we count them happi which endur ye have heard of the
patienc of job and have seen the end of the lord; that the lord is
veri piti and of tender merci

5:12 but abov all thing my brethren swear not neither by heaven
neither by the earth neither by ani other oath: but let your yea be
yea; and your nay nay; lest ye fall into condemn

5:13 is ani among you afflicted? let him pray is ani merry? let him
sing psalm

5:14 is ani sick among you? let him call for the elder of the church;
and let them pray over him anoint him with oil in the name of the
lord: 5:15 and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord
shall rais him up; and if he have commit sin they shall be
forgiven him

5:16 confess your fault one to anoth and pray one for anoth
that ye may be heal the effectu fervent prayer of a righteou man
availeth much

5:17 elia wa a man subject to like passion as we are and he pray
earnestli that it might not rain: and it rain not on the earth by
the space of three year and six month

5:18 and he pray again and the heaven gave rain and the earth
brought forth her fruit

5:19 brethren if ani of you do err from the truth and one convert
him; 5:20 let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of hi way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a
multitud of sin

dilig who prophesi of the grace that should come unto you:
1:11 search what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which
wa in them did signifi when it testifi beforehand the suffer

1:12 unto whom it wa reveal that not unto themselv but unto us
they did minist the thing which are now report unto you by them
that have preach the gospel unto you with the holi ghost sent down

1:16 becaus it is written be ye holy; for i am holi

1:17 and if ye call on the father who without respect of person

1:22 see ye have purifi your soul in obey the truth through
the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren see that ye love one
anoth with a pure heart fervently: 1:23 be born again not of
corrupt seed but of incorrupt by the word of god which
liveth and abideth for ever

1:24 for all flesh is as grass and all the glori of man as the flower
of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away:
1:25 but the word of the lord endureth for ever and thi is the word
which by the gospel is preach unto you

2:1 wherefor lay asid all malic and all guil and hypocrisi
and envi all evil speak 2:2 as newborn babe desir the
sincer milk of the word that ye may grow thereby: 2:3 if so be ye
have tast that the lord is graciou

2:4 to whom come as unto a live stone disallow inde of men
but chosen of god and preciou 2:5 ye also as live stone are
built up a spiritu hous an holi priesthood to offer up spiritu
sacrific accept to god by jesu christ

2:6 wherefor also it is contain in the scriptur behold i lay in
sion a chief corner stone elect precious: and he that believeth on
him shall not be confound

2:7 unto you therefor which believ he is precious: but unto them
which be disobedi the stone which the builder disallow the
same is made the head of the corner 2:8 and a stone of stumbl and
a rock of offenc even to them which stumbl at the word be
disobedient: whereunto also they were appoint

2:9 but ye are a chosen gener a royal priesthood an holi
nation a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the prais of
him who hath call you out of dark into hi marvel light;
2:10 which in time past were not a peopl but are now the peopl of
god: which had not obtain merci but now have obtain merci

2:11 dearli belov i beseech you as stranger and pilgrim abstain
from fleshli lust which war against the soul; 2:12 have your
convers honest among the gentiles: that wherea they speak
against you as evildo they may by your good work which they
shall behold glorifi god in the day of visit

2:13 submit yourselv to everi ordin of man for the lord sake:
whether it be to the king as supreme; 2:14 or unto governor as unto
them that are sent by him for the punish of evildo and for the
prais of them that do well

2:15 for so is the will of god that with well do ye may put to
silenc the ignor of foolish men: 2:16 as free and not use your
liberti for a cloke of malici but as the servant of god

2:17 honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king

2:18 servant be subject to your master with all fear; not onli to
the good and gentl but also to the froward

2:19 for thi is thankworthi if a man for conscienc toward god
endur grief suffer wrong

2:20 for what glori is it if when ye be buffet for your fault ye
shall take it patiently? but if when ye do well and suffer for it
ye take it patient thi is accept with god

2:21 for even hereunto were ye called: becaus christ also suffer
for us leav us an exampl that ye should follow hi steps: 2:22
who did no sin neither wa guil found in hi mouth: 2:23 who when
he wa revil revil not again; when he suffer he threaten
not; but commit himself to him that judgeth righteously: 2:24 who
hi own self bare our sin in hi own bodi on the tree that we be
dead to sin should live unto righteousness: by whose stripe ye were
heal

2:25 for ye were as sheep go astray; but are now return unto the
shepherd and bishop of your soul

3:1 likewis ye wive be in subject to your own husbands; that
if ani obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the
convers of the wives; 3:2 while they behold your chast
convers coupl with fear

3:3 whose adorn let it not be that outward adorn of plait the
hair and of wear of gold or of put on of apparel; 3:4 but let
it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corrupt
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of
god of great price

3:5 for after thi manner in the old time the holi women also who
trust in god adorn themselv be in subject unto their own
husbands: 3:6 even as sara obey abraham call him lord: whose
daughter ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with ani
amaz

3:7 likewis ye husband dwell with them accord to knowledg
give honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as be
heir togeth of the grace of life; that your prayer be not
hinder

3:8 final be ye all of one mind have compass one of anoth
love as brethren be piti be courteous: 3:9 not render evil for
evil or rail for railing: but contrariwis blessing; know that
ye are thereunto call that ye should inherit a bless

3:10 for he that will love life and see good day let him refrain
hi tongu from evil and hi lip that they speak no guile: 3:11 let
him eschew evil and do good; let him seek peac and ensu it

3:12 for the eye of the lord are over the righteou and hi ear are
open unto their prayers: but the face of the lord is against them that
do evil

3:13 and who is he that will harm you if ye be follow of that
which is good? 3:14 but and if ye suffer for righteous sake
happi are ye: and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled;
3:15 but sanctifi the lord god in your hearts: and be readi alway to
give an answer to everi man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meek and fear: 3:16 have a good conscience; that
wherea they speak evil of you as of evildo they may be asham
that fals accus your good convers in christ

3:17 for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for
well do than for evil do

3:18 for christ also hath onc suffer for sin the just for the
unjust that he might bring us to god be put to death in the
flesh but quicken by the spirit: 3:19 by which also he went and
preach unto the spirit in prison; 3:20 which sometim were
disobedi when onc the longsuff of god wait in the day of
noah while the ark wa a prepar wherein few that is eight soul
were save by water

3:21 the like figur whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
the put away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good
conscienc toward god) by the resurrect of jesu christ: 3:22 who
is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god; angel and
author and power be made subject unto him

4:1 forasmuch then as christ hath suffer for us in the flesh arm
yourselv likewis with the same mind: for he that hath suffer in
the flesh hath ceas from sin; 4:2 that he no longer should live the
rest of hi time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of
god

4:3 for the time past of our life may suffic us to have wrought the
will of the gentil when we walk in lascivi lust excess
of wine revel banquet and abomin idolatries: 4:4
wherein they think it strang that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot speak evil of you: 4:5 who shall give account to
him that is readi to judg the quick and the dead

4:6 for for thi caus wa the gospel preach also to them that are
dead that they might be judg accord to men in the flesh but
live accord to god in the spirit

4:7 but the end of all thing is at hand: be ye therefor sober and
watch unto prayer

4:8 and abov all thing have fervent chariti among yourselves: for
chariti shall cover the multitud of sin

4:9 use hospit one to anoth without grudg

4:10 as everi man hath receiv the gift even so minist the same
one to anoth as good steward of the manifold grace of god

4:11 if ani man speak let him speak as the oracl of god; if ani man
minist let him do it as of the abil which god giveth: that god
in all thing may be glorifi through jesu christ to whom be prais
and dominion for ever and ever amen

4:12 belov think it not strang concern the fieri trial which is
to tri you as though some strang thing happen unto you: 4:13 but
rejoic inasmuch as ye are partak of christ sufferings; that
when hi glori shall be reveal ye may be glad also with exceed
joy

4:14 if ye be reproach for the name of christ happi are ye; for the
spirit of glori and of god resteth upon you: on their part he is evil
spoken of but on your part he is glorifi

4:15 but let none of you suffer as a murder or as a thief or as an
evildo or as a busybodi in other men matter

4:16 yet if ani man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed; but
let him glorifi god on thi behalf

4:17 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the hous of
god: and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of god? 4:18 and if the righteou scarc be
save where shall the ungodli and the sinner appear? 4:19 wherefor
let them that suffer accord to the will of god commit the keep
of their soul to him in well do as unto a faith creator

5:1 the elder which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and
a wit of the suffer of christ and also a partak of the
glori that shall be revealed: 5:2 feed the flock of god which is among
you take the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly;
not for filthi lucr but of a readi mind; 5:3 neither as be lord
over god heritag but be ensampl to the flock

5:4 and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receiv a crown
of glori that fadeth not away

5:5 likewis ye younger submit yourselv unto the elder yea all
of you be subject one to anoth and be cloth with humility: for
god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humbl

5:6 humbl yourselv therefor under the mighti hand of god that he
may exalt you in due time: 5:7 cast all your care upon him; for he
careth for you

5:8 be sober be vigilant; becaus your adversari the devil as a
roar lion walketh about seek whom he may devour: 5:9 whom
resist stedfast in the faith know that the same afflict are
accomplish in your brethren that are in the world

5:10 but the god of all grace who hath call us unto hi etern
glori by christ jesu after that ye have suffer a while make you
perfect stablish strengthen settl you

5:11 to him be glori and dominion for ever and ever amen

5:12 by silvanu a faith brother unto you as i suppos i have

the second gener epistl of peter


1:1 simon peter a servant and an apostl of jesu christ to them
that have obtain like preciou faith with us through the
righteous of god and our saviour jesu christ: 1:2 grace and peac
be multipli unto you through the knowledg of god and of jesu our
lord 1:3 accord as hi divin power hath given unto us all thing
that pertain unto life and godli through the knowledg of him
that hath call us to glori and virtue: 1:4 wherebi are given unto us
exceed great and preciou promises: that by these ye might be
partak of the divin natur have escap the corrupt that is
in the world through lust

1:5 and besid thi give all dilig add to your faith virtue;
and to virtu knowledge; 1:6 and to knowledg temperance; and to
temper patience; and to patienc godliness; 1:7 and to godli
brotherli kindness; and to brotherli kind chariti

1:8 for if these thing be in you and abound they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruit in the knowledg of our lord
jesu christ

1:9 but he that lacketh these thing is blind and cannot see afar
off and hath forgotten that he wa purg from hi old sin

1:10 wherefor the rather brethren give dilig to make your
call and elect sure: for if ye do these thing ye shall never
fall: 1:11 for so an entranc shall be minist unto you abundantli
into the everlast kingdom of our lord and saviour jesu christ

1:12 wherefor i will not be neglig to put you alway in
remembr of these thing though ye know them and be establish
in the present truth

1:13 yea i think it meet as long as i am in thi tabernacl to stir
you up by put you in remembrance; 1:14 know that shortli i must
put off thi my tabernacl even as our lord jesu christ hath shew
me

1:15 moreov i will endeavour that ye may be abl after my deceas to
have these thing alway in remembr

1:16 for we have not follow cunningli devis fabl when we made
known unto you the power and come of our lord jesu christ but were
eyewit of hi majesti

1:17 for he receiv from god the father honour and glori when there
came such a voic to him from the excel glori thi is my belov
son in whom i am well pleas

1:18 and thi voic which came from heaven we heard when we were with
him in the holi mount

1:19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until
the day dawn and the day star aris in your hearts: 1:20 know thi
first that no propheci of the scriptur is of ani privat
interpret

1:21 for the propheci came not in old time by the will of man: but
holi men of god spake as they were move by the holi ghost

2:1 but there were fals prophet also among the peopl even as there
shall be fals teacher among you who privili shall bring in damnabl
heresi even deni the lord that bought them and bring upon
themselv swift destruct

2:2 and mani shall follow their pernici ways; by reason of whom the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of

2:3 and through covet shall they with feign word make
merchandis of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not
and their damnat slumbereth not

2:4 for if god spare not the angel that sin but cast them down
to hell and deliv them into chain of dark to be reserv
unto judgment; 2:5 and spare not the old world but save noah the
eighth person a preacher of righteous bring in the flood upon
the world of the ungodly; 2:6 and turn the citi of sodom and
gomorrha into ash condemn them with an overthrow make them an
ensampl unto those that after should live ungodly; 2:7 and deliv
just lot vex with the filthi convers of the wicked: 2:8 (for
that righteou man dwell among them in see and hear vex
hi righteou soul from day to day with their unlaw deeds;) 2:9 the
lord knoweth how to deliv the godli out of temptat and to
reserv the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 2:10 but
chiefli them that walk after the flesh in the lust of unclean and
despis govern presumptu are they selfwil they are not
afraid to speak evil of digniti

2:11 wherea angel which are greater in power and might bring not
rail accus against them befor the lord

2:12 but these as natur brute beast made to be taken and
destroy speak evil of the thing that they understand not; and
shall utterli perish in their own corruption; 2:13 and shall receiv
the reward of unright as they that count it pleasur to riot
in the day time spot they are and blemish sport themselv
with their own deceiv while they feast with you; 2:14 have eye
full of adulteri and that cannot ceas from sin; beguil unstabl
souls: an heart they have exercis with covet practices; curs
children: 2:15 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray
follow the way of balaam the son of bosor who love the wage of
unrighteousness; 2:16 but wa rebuk for hi iniquity: the dumb ass
speak with man voic forbad the mad of the prophet

2:17 these are well without water cloud that are carri with a
tempest; to whom the mist of dark is reserv for ever

2:18 for when they speak great swell word of vaniti they allur
through the lust of the flesh through much wanton those that
were clean escap from them who live in error

2:19 while they promis them liberti they themselv are the servant
of corruption: for of whom a man is overcom of the same is he
brought in bondag

2:20 for if after they have escap the pollut of the world
through the knowledg of the lord and saviour jesu christ they are
again entangl therein and overcom the latter end is wors with
them than the begin

2:21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteous than after they have known it to turn from the holi
command deliv unto them

2:22 but it is happen unto them accord to the true proverb the
dog is turn to hi own vomit again; and the sow that wa wash to
her wallow in the mire

3:1 thi second epistl belov i now write unto you; in both which
i stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance: 3:2 that ye may be
mind of the word which were spoken befor by the holi prophet
and of the command of us the apostl of the lord and saviour: 3:3
know thi first that there shall come in the last day scoffer
walk after their own lust 3:4 and say where is the promis of
hi coming? for sinc the father fell asleep all thing continu as
they were from the begin of the creation

3:5 for thi they willingli are ignor of that by the word of god
the heaven were of old and the earth stand out of the water and
in the water: 3:6 wherebi the world that then wa be overflow
with water perished: 3:7 but the heaven and the earth which are
now by the same word are kept in store reserv unto fire against
the day of judgment and perdit of ungodli men

3:8 but belov be not ignor of thi one thing that one day is
with the lord as a thousand year and a thousand year as one day

3:9 the lord is not slack concern hi promis as some men count
slackness; but is longsuff to us-ward not will that ani
should perish but that all should come to repent

3:10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
which the heaven shall pass away with a great nois and the element
shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the work that are
therein shall be burn up

3:11 see then that all these thing shall be dissolv what manner
of person ought ye to be in all holi convers and godli 3:12
look for and hast unto the come of the day of god wherein the
heaven be on fire shall be dissolv and the element shall melt
with fervent heat? 3:13 nevertheless we accord to hi promis
look for new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteous

3:14 wherefor belov see that ye look for such thing be
dilig that ye may be found of him in peac without spot and
blameless

3:15 and account that the longsuff of our lord is salvation; even
as our belov brother paul also accord to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you; 3:16 as also in all hi epistl speak

the first epistl gener of john


1:1 that which wa from the begin which we have heard which we
have seen with our eye which we have look upon and our hand have
handl of the word of life; 1:2 (for the life wa manifest and we
have seen it and bear wit and shew unto you that etern life
which wa with the father and wa manifest unto us;) 1:3 that which
we have seen and heard declar we unto you that ye also may have
fellowship with us: and truli our fellowship is with the father and
with hi son jesu christ

1:4 and these thing write we unto you that your joy may be full

1:5 thi then is the messag which we have heard of him and declar
unto you that god is light and in him is no dark at all

1:6 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in dark
we lie and do not the truth: 1:7 but if we walk in the light as he
is in the light we have fellowship one with anoth and the blood of
jesu christ hi son cleanseth us from all sin

1:8 if we say that we have no sin we deceiv ourselv and the truth
is not in us

1:9 if we confess our sin he is faith and just to forgiv us our
sin and to cleans us from all unright

1:10 if we say that we have not sin we make him a liar and hi
word is not in us

2:1 my littl children these thing write i unto you that ye sin
not

and if ani man sin we have an advoc with the father jesu christ
the righteous: 2:2 and he is the propiti for our sins: and not
for our onli but also for the sin of the whole world

2:3 and herebi we do know that we know him if we keep hi
command

2:4 he that saith i know him and keepeth not hi command is a
liar and the truth is not in him

2:5 but whoso keepeth hi word in him verili is the love of god
perfected: herebi know we that we are in him

2:6 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk
even as he walk

2:7 brethren i write no new command unto you but an old
command which ye had from the begin the old command is
the word which ye have heard from the begin

2:8 again a new command i write unto you which thing is true in
him and in you: becaus the dark is past and the true light now
shineth

2:9 he that saith he is in the light and hateth hi brother is in
dark even until now

2:10 he that loveth hi brother abideth in the light and there is
none occas of stumbl in him

2:11 but he that hateth hi brother is in dark and walketh in
dark and knoweth not whither he goeth becaus that dark hath
blind hi eye

2:12 i write unto you littl children becaus your sin are forgiven
you for hi name sake

2:13 i write unto you father becaus ye have known him that is from
the begin i write unto you young men becaus ye have overcom
the wick one i write unto you littl children becaus ye have
known the father

2:14 i have written unto you father becaus ye have known him that
is from the begin i have written unto you young men becaus ye
are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcom
the wick one

2:15 love not the world neither the thing that are in the world if
ani man love the world the love of the father is not in him

2:16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust
of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but is of
the world

2:17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof: but he that
doeth the will of god abideth for ever

2:18 littl children it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
antichrist shall come even now are there mani antichrists; wherebi we
know that it is the last time

2:19 they went out from us but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us they would no doubt have continu with us: but they went
out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us

2:20 but ye have an unction from the holi one and ye know all thing

2:21 i have not written unto you becaus ye know not the truth but
becaus ye know it and that no lie is of the truth

2:22 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesu is the christ? he is
antichrist that denieth the father and the son

2:23 whosoev denieth the son the same hath not the father: he that
acknowledgeth the son hath the father also

2:24 let that therefor abid in you which ye have heard from the
begin if that which ye have heard from the begin shall remain
in you ye also shall continu in the son and in the father

2:25 and thi is the promis that he hath promis us even etern
life

2:26 these thing have i written unto you concern them that seduc
you

2:27 but the anoint which ye have receiv of him abideth in you
and ye need not that ani man teach you: but as the same anoint
teacheth you of all thing and is truth and is no lie and even as
it hath taught you ye shall abid in him

2:28 and now littl children abid in him; that when he shall
appear we may have confid and not be asham befor him at hi
come

2:29 if ye know that he is righteou ye know that everi one that
doeth righteous is born of him

3:1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon us that
we should be call the son of god: therefor the world knoweth us
not becaus it knew him not

3:2 belov now are we the son of god and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear we shall be
like him; for we shall see him as he is

3:3 and everi man that hath thi hope in him purifieth himself even
as he is pure

3:4 whosoev committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
the transgress of the law

3:5 and ye know that he wa manifest to take away our sins; and in
him is no sin

3:6 whosoev abideth in him sinneth not: whosoev sinneth hath not
seen him neither known him

3:7 littl children let no man deceiv you: he that doeth
righteous is righteou even as he is righteou

3:8 he that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
the begin for thi purpos the son of god wa manifest that he
might destroy the work of the devil

3:9 whosoev is born of god doth not commit sin; for hi seed
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin becaus he is born of god

3:10 in thi the children of god are manifest and the children of the
devil: whosoev doeth not righteous is not of god neither he
that loveth not hi brother

3:11 for thi is the messag that ye heard from the begin that we
should love one anoth

3:12 not as cain who wa of that wick one and slew hi brother
and wherefor slew he him? becaus hi own work were evil and hi
brother righteou

3:13 marvel not my brethren if the world hate you

3:14 we know that we have pass from death unto life becaus we love
the brethren he that loveth not hi brother abideth in death

3:15 whosoev hateth hi brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
murder hath etern life abid in him

3:16 herebi perceiv we the love of god becaus he laid down hi life
for us: and we ought to lay down our live for the brethren

3:17 but whoso hath thi world good and seeth hi brother have
need and shutteth up hi bowel of compass from him how dwelleth
the love of god in him? 3:18 my littl children let us not love in
word neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth

3:19 and herebi we know that we are of the truth and shall assur our
heart befor him

3:20 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and
knoweth all thing

3:21 belov if our heart condemn us not then have we confid
toward god

3:22 and whatsoev we ask we receiv of him becaus we keep hi
command and do those thing that are pleas in hi sight

3:23 and thi is hi command that we should believ on the name
of hi son jesu christ and love one anoth as he gave us
command

3:24 and he that keepeth hi command dwelleth in him and he in
him

and herebi we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath
given us

4:1 belov believ not everi spirit but tri the spirit whether
they are of god: becaus mani fals prophet are gone out into the
world

4:2 herebi know ye the spirit of god: everi spirit that confesseth
that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god: 4:3 and everi spirit
that confesseth not that jesu christ is come in the flesh is not of
god: and thi is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that
it should come; and even now alreadi is it in the world

4:4 ye are of god littl children and have overcom them: becaus
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world

4:5 they are of the world: therefor speak they of the world and the
world heareth them

4:6 we are of god: he that knoweth god heareth us; he that is not of
god heareth not us herebi know we the spirit of truth and the spirit
of error

4:7 belov let us love one another: for love is of god; and everi
one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god

4:8 he that loveth not knoweth not god; for god is love

4:9 in thi wa manifest the love of god toward us becaus that god
sent hi onli begotten son into the world that we might live through
him

4:10 herein is love not that we love god but that he love us and
sent hi son to be the propiti for our sin

4:11 belov if god so love us we ought also to love one anoth

4:12 no man hath seen god at ani time if we love one anoth god
dwelleth in us and hi love is perfect in us

4:13 herebi know we that we dwell in him and he in us becaus he
hath given us of hi spirit

4:14 and we have seen and do testifi that the father sent the son to
be the saviour of the world

4:15 whosoev shall confess that jesu is the son of god god
dwelleth in him and he in god

4:16 and we have known and believ the love that god hath to us god
is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him

4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have bold in the
day of judgment: becaus as he is so are we in thi world

4:18 there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
becaus fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in
love

4:19 we love him becaus he first love us

4:20 if a man say i love god and hateth hi brother he is a liar:
for he that loveth not hi brother whom he hath seen how can he love
god whom he hath not seen? 4:21 and thi command have we from
him that he who loveth god love hi brother also

5:1 whosoev believeth that jesu is the christ is born of god: and
everi one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten
of him

5:2 by thi we know that we love the children of god when we love
god and keep hi command

5:3 for thi is the love of god that we keep hi commandments: and
hi command are not grievou

5:4 for whatsoev is born of god overcometh the world: and thi is
the victori that overcometh the world even our faith

5:5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that
jesu is the son of god? 5:6 thi is he that came by water and blood
even jesu christ; not by water onli but by water and blood and it
is the spirit that beareth wit becaus the spirit is truth

5:7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the
word and the holi ghost: and these three are one

5:8 and there are three that bear wit in earth the spirit and
the water and the blood: and these three agre in one

5:9 if we receiv the wit of men the wit of god is greater:
for thi is the wit of god which he hath testifi of hi son

5:10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the wit in himself:
he that believeth not god hath made him a liar; becaus he believeth
not the record that god gave of hi son

5:11 and thi is the record that god hath given to us etern life
and thi life is in hi son

5:12 he that hath the son hath life; and he that hath not the son of
god hath not life

5:13 these thing have i written unto you that believ on the name of
the son of god; that ye may know that ye have etern life and that
ye may believ on the name of the son of god

5:14 and thi is the confid that we have in him that if we ask
ani thing accord to hi will he heareth us: 5:15 and if we know
that he hear us whatsoev we ask we know that we have the petit
that we desir of him

5:16 if ani man see hi brother sin a sin which is not unto death he
shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
death there is a sin unto death: i do not say that he shall pray for
it

5:17 all unright is sin: and there is a sin not unto death

5:18 we know that whosoev is born of god sinneth not; but he that is
begotten of god keepeth himself and that wick one toucheth him not

5:19 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in
wicked

5:20 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an
understand that we may know him that is true and we are in him
that is true even in hi son jesu christ thi is the true god and
etern life

5:21 littl children keep yourselv from idol amen

1:3 belov when i gave all dilig to write unto you of the common

1:9 yet michael the archangel when contend with the devil he
disput about the bodi of mose durst not bring against him a
rail accus but said the lord rebuk thee

what they know natur as brute beast in those thing they
corrupt themselv

1:11 woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of cain and ran
greedili after the error of balaam for reward and perish in the
gainsay of core

1:12 these are spot in your feast of chariti when they feast with

carri about of winds; tree whose fruit withereth without fruit
twice dead pluck up by the roots; 1:13 rage wave of the sea

1:9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribul
and in the kingdom and patienc of jesu christ wa in the isl that
is call patmo for the word of god and for the testimoni of jesu
christ

1:10 i wa in the spirit on the lord day and heard behind me a
great voic as of a trumpet 1:11 say i am alpha and omega the
first and the last: and what thou seest write in a book and send it
unto the seven church which are in asia; unto ephesu and unto
smyrna and unto pergamo and unto thyatira and unto sardi and
unto philadelphia and unto laodicea

1:12 and i turn to see the voic that spake with me and be
turn i saw seven golden candlesticks; 1:13 and in the midst of the
seven candlestick one like unto the son of man cloth with a
garment down to the foot and girt about the pap with a golden
girdl

1:14 hi head and hi hair were white like wool as white as snow;
and hi eye were as a flame of fire; 1:15 and hi feet like unto fine
brass as if they burn in a furnace; and hi voic as the sound of
mani water

1:16 and he had in hi right hand seven stars: and out of hi mouth
went a sharp twoedg sword: and hi counten wa as the sun
shineth in hi strength

1:17 and when i saw him i fell at hi feet as dead and he laid hi
right hand upon me say unto me fear not; i am the first and the
last: 1:18 i am he that liveth and wa dead; and behold i am aliv
for evermor amen; and have the key of hell and of death

1:19 write the thing which thou hast seen and the thing which are
and the thing which shall be hereafter; 1:20 the mysteri of the seven
star which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden
candlestick the seven star are the angel of the seven churches:
and the seven candlestick which thou sawest are the seven church

2:1 unto the angel of the church of ephesu write; these thing saith
he that holdeth the seven star in hi right hand who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks; 2:2 i know thi work and thi
labour and thi patienc and how thou canst not bear them which are
evil: and thou hast tri them which say they are apostl and are
not and hast found them liars: 2:3 and hast born and hast patienc
and for my name sake hast labour and hast not faint

2:4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee becaus thou hast left
thi first love

2:5 rememb therefor from whenc thou art fallen and repent and do
the first works; or els i will come unto thee quickli and will
remov thi candlestick out of hi place except thou repent

2:6 but thi thou hast that thou hatest the deed of the
nicolaitan which i also hate

2:7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of
life which is in the midst of the paradis of god

2:8 and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write; these thing
saith the first and the last which wa dead and is alive; 2:9 i know
thi work and tribul and poverti (but thou art rich) and i
know the blasphemi of them which say they are jew and are not but
are the synagogu of satan

2:10 fear none of those thing which thou shalt suffer: behold the
devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried; and ye
shall have tribul ten days: be thou faith unto death and i
will give thee a crown of life

2:11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches; he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death

2:12 and to the angel of the church in pergamo write; these thing
saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; 2:13 i know thi
work and where thou dwellest even where satan seat is: and thou
holdest fast my name and hast not deni my faith even in those day
wherein antipa wa my faith martyr who wa slain among you where
satan dwelleth

2:14 but i have a few thing against thee becaus thou hast there
them that hold the doctrin of balaam who taught balac to cast a
stumblingblock befor the children of israel to eat thing sacrif
unto idol and to commit fornic

2:15 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrin of the
nicolaitan which thing i hate

2:16 repent; or els i will come unto thee quickli and will fight
against them with the sword of my mouth

2:17 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden
manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name
written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it

2:18 and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write; these thing
saith the son of god who hath hi eye like unto a flame of fire and
hi feet are like fine brass; 2:19 i know thi work and chariti and
servic and faith and thi patienc and thi works; and the last to
be more than the first

2:20 notwithstand i have a few thing against thee becaus thou
sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to
teach and to seduc my servant to commit fornic and to eat
thing sacrif unto idol

2:21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
repent not

2:22 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adulteri
with her into great tribul except they repent of their deed

2:23 and i will kill her children with death; and all the church
shall know that i am he which searcheth the rein and hearts: and i
will give unto everi one of you accord to your work

2:24 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as mani as
have not thi doctrin and which have not known the depth of satan
as they speak; i will put upon you none other burden

2:25 but that which ye have alreadi hold fast till i come

2:26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my work unto the end to him
will i give power over the nations: 2:27 and he shall rule them with a
rod of iron; as the vessel of a potter shall they be broken to
shivers: even as i receiv of my father

2:28 and i will give him the morn star

2:29 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
church

3:1 and unto the angel of the church in sardi write; these thing
saith he that hath the seven spirit of god and the seven stars; i
know thi work that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead

3:2 be watch and strengthen the thing which remain that are
readi to die: for i have not found thi work perfect befor god

3:3 rememb therefor how thou hast receiv and heard and hold
fast and repent if therefor thou shalt not watch i will come on
thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon
thee

3:4 thou hast a few name even in sardi which have not defil their
garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthi

3:5 he that overcometh the same shall be cloth in white raiment;
and i will not blot out hi name out of the book of life but i will
confess hi name befor my father and befor hi angel

3:6 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
church

3:7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write; these thing
