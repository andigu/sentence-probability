watch the first earli morn sunbeam creep through the green
forest to chase out the black shadow onc more he yawn and slowli
got to hi feet and shook himself then he walk over to a big
pine-tre stood up on hi hind leg reach as high up on the trunk of
the tree as he could and scratch the bark with hi great claw after
that he yawn until it seem as if hi jaw would crack and then sat
down to think what he want for breakfast

while he sat there tri to make up hi mind what would tast best he
wa listen to the sound that told of the wake of all the littl
peopl who live in the green forest he heard sammi jay way off in the
distanc scream thief! thief! and grin i wonder thought
buster if some one ha stolen sammi breakfast or if he ha stolen
the breakfast of some one els probabl he is the thief himself

he heard chatter the red squirrel scold as fast as he could make
hi tongu go and work himself into a terribl rage must be that
chatter got out of bed the wrong way thi morn thought he

he heard blacki the crow caw at the top of hi lung and he knew by
the sound that blacki wa get into mischief of some kind he heard
the sweet voic of happi littl singer and they were good to hear
but most of all he listen to a merri low silveri laugh that never
stop but went on and on until he just felt as if he must laugh too
it wa the voic of the laugh brook and as buster listen it
suddenli came to him just what he want for breakfast

im go fish said he in hi deep grumbly-rumbl voic to no one
in particular ye sir im go fish i want some fat trout for
my breakfast

he shuffl along over to the laugh brook and straight to a littl
pool of which he knew and as he drew near he took the greatest care not
to make the teeniest weeniest bit of nois now it just happen that
earli as he wa some one wa befor buster bear when he came in sight
of the littl pool who should he see but anoth fisherman there who
had alreadi caught a fine fat trout who wa it? whi littl joe otter
to be sure he wa just climb up the bank with the fat trout in hi
mouth buster bear own mouth water as he saw it littl joe sat down
on the bank and prepar to enjoy hi breakfast he hadnt seen buster
bear and he didnt know that he or ani one els wa anywher near

buster bear tipto up veri softli until he wa right behind littl joe
otter woof woof! said he in hi deepest most grumbly-rumbl voic
that a veri fine look trout i wouldnt mind if i had it myself

littl joe otter gave a frighten squeal and without even turn to
see who wa speak drop hi fish and dive headfirst into the
laugh brook buster bear sprang forward and with one of hi big paw
caught the fat trout just as it wa slip back into the water

[illustration: here your trout mr otter said he _page 5_]

but littl joe wouldnt the fact is he wa afraid to he snarl at
buster bear and call him a thief and everyth bad he could think of
buster didnt seem to mind he chuckl as if he thought it all a great
joke and repeat hi invit to littl joe to come and get hi fish
but littl joe just turn hi back and went off down the laugh brook
in a great rage

it too bad to wast such a fine fish said buster thought i
wonder what id better do with it and while he wa wonder he ate
it all up then he start down the laugh brook to tri to catch some
for himself




ii

littl joe otter get even with buster bear


littl joe otter wa in a terribl rage it wa a bad begin for a
beauti day and littl joe knew it but who wouldnt be in a rage if
hi breakfast wa taken from him just as he wa about to eat it? anyway
that is what littl joe told billi mink perhap he didnt tell it quit
exactli as it wa but you know he wa veri badli frighten at the
time

i wa sit on the bank of the laugh brook besid one of the
littl pool he told billi mink and wa just go to eat a fat
trout i had caught when who should come along but that great big
bulli buster bear he took that fat trout away from me and ate it just
as if it belong to him! i hate him! if i live long enough im go to
get even with him!

of cours that wasnt nice talk and anyth but a nice spirit but
littl joe otter temper is sometim pretti short especi when he
is hungri and thi time he had had no breakfast you know

buster bear hadnt actual taken the fish away from littl joe but
look at the matter as littl joe did it amount to the same thing
you see buster knew perfectli well when he invit littl joe to come
back and get it that littl joe wouldnt dare do anyth of the kind

where is he now? ask billi mink

he somewher up the laugh brook i wish hed fall in and get
drowned! snap littl joe

billi mink just had to laugh the idea of great big buster bear get
drown in the laugh brook wa too funni there wasnt water enough
in it anywher except down in the smile pool and that wa on the
green meadow where buster had never been known to go let go see
what he is do said billi mink

at first littl joe didnt want to but at last hi curios got the
better of hi fear and he agre so the two littl brown-coat scamp
turn down the laugh brook take the greatest care to keep out of
sight themselv they had gone onli a littl way when billi mink
whispered: sh-h! there he is

sure enough there wa buster bear sit close besid a littl pool
and look into it veri intent

what he doing? ask littl joe otter as buster bear sat for the
longest time without move

just then one of buster big paw went into the water as quick as a
flash and scoop out a trout that had ventur too near

he fishing! exclaim billi mink

and that is just what buster bear wa do and it wa veri plain to
see that he wa have great fun when he had eaten the trout he had
caught he move along to the next littl pool

they are _our_ fish! said littl joe fierc he ha no busi
catch _our_ fish!

i dont see how we are go to stop him said billi mink

i do! cri littl joe into whose head an idea had just pop im
go to drive all the fish out of the littl pool and muddi the water
all up then well see how mani fish he will get! just you watch me get
even with buster bear

littl joe slip swiftli into the water and swam straight to the
littl pool that buster bear would tri next he frighten the fish so
that they fled in everi direct then he stir up the mud until the
water wa so dirti that buster couldnt have seen a fish right under hi
nose he did the same thing in the next pool and the next buster bear
fish wa spoil for that day




iii

buster bear is greatli puzzl


buster bear hadnt enjoy himself so much sinc he came to the green
forest to live hi fun began when he surpris littl joe otter on the
bank of a littl pool in the laugh brook and littl joe wa so
frighten that he drop a fat trout he had just caught it had seem
like a great joke to buster bear and he had chuckl over it all the
time he wa eat the fat trout when he had finish it he start on
to do some fish himself

present he came to anoth littl pool he stole up to it veri veri
softli so as not to frighten the fish then he sat down close to the
edg of it and didnt move buster learn a long time ago that a
fisherman must be patient unless like littl joe otter he is just as
much at home in the water as the fish themselv and can swim fast
enough to catch them by chase them so he didnt move so much as an
eye lash he wa so still that he look almost like the stump of an old
tree perhap that is what the fish thought he wa for pretti soon two
or three swam right in close to where he wa sit now buster bear
may be big and clumsi look but there isnt anyth that can move
much quicker than one of those big paw of hi when he want it to one
of them move now and quicker than a wink had scoop one of those
foolish fish out on to the bank

buster littl eye twinkl and he smack hi lip as he move on
to the next littl pool for he knew that it wa of no use to stay
longer at the first one the fish were so frighten that they wouldnt
come back for a long long time at the next littl pool the same thing
happen by thi time buster bear wa in fine spirit it wa fun to
catch the fish and it wa still more fun to eat them what finer
breakfast could ani one have than fresh-caught trout? no wonder he felt
good! but it take more than three trout to fill buster bear stomach
so he kept on to the next littl pool

but thi littl pool instead of be beauti and clear so that
buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were ani
fish there wa so muddi that he couldnt see into it at all it look
as if some one had just stir up all the mud at the bottom

huh! said buster bear it of no use to tri to fish here i would
just wast my time ill tri the next pool

so he went on to the next littl pool he found thi just as muddi as
the other then he went on to anoth and thi wa no better buster
sat down and scratch hi head it wa puzzl ye sir it wa
puzzl he look thi way and he look that way suspici but
there wa no one to be seen everyth wa still save for the laughter
of the laugh brook somehow it seem to buster as if the brook were
laugh at him

it veri curiou mutter buster veri curiou inde it look as
if my fish is spoil for to-day i dont understand it at all it
lucki i caught what i did it look as if somebodi is tri to--ha! a
sudden thought had pop into hi head then he began to chuckl and
final to laugh i do believ that scamp joe otter is tri to get
even with me for eat that fat trout!

and then becaus buster bear alway enjoy a good joke even when it is
on himself he laugh until he had to hold hi side which is a whole
lot better than go off in a rage as littl joe otter had done
your pretti smart mr otter! your pretti smart but there are
other peopl who are smart too said buster bear and still chuckl
he went off to think up a plan to get the best of littl joe otter




iv

littl joe otter suppli buster bear with a breakfast


get even just for spite
doesnt alway pay
fact is it is veri apt
to work the other way

that is just how it came about that littl joe otter furnish buster
bear with the best breakfast he had had for a long time he didnt mean
to do it oh my no! the truth is he thought all the time that he wa
prevent buster bear from get a breakfast you see he wasnt well
enough acquaint with buster to know that buster is quit as smart as
he is and perhap a littl bit smarter spite and selfish were at
the bottom of it you see littl joe and billi mink had had all the
fish in the laugh brook to themselv so long that they thought no
one els had ani right to fish there to be sure bobbi coon caught a few
littl fish there but they didnt mind bobbi farmer brown boy fish
there too sometim and thi alway made littl joe and billi mink
veri angri but they were so afraid of him that they didnt dare do
anyth about it but when they discov that buster bear wa a
fisherman they made up their mind that someth had got to be done
at least littl joe did

hell tri it again to-morrow morn said littl joe ill keep
watch and as soon as i see him come ill drive out all the fish
just as i did to-day i guess thatll teach him to let our fish alon

so the next morn littl joe hid befor daylight close by the littl
pool where buster bear had given him such a fright sure enough just as
the jolli sunbeam began to creep through the green forest he saw
buster bear come straight over to the littl pool littl joe slip
into the water and chase all the fish out of the littl pool and
stir up the mud on the bottom so that the water wa so muddi that the
bottom couldnt be seen at all then he hurri down to the next littl
pool and did the same thing

now buster bear is veri smart you know he had guess the day befor
who had spoil hi fish so thi morn he onli went far enough to
make sure that if littl joe were watch for him as he wa sure he
would be he would see him come then instead of keep on to the
littl pool he hurri to a place way down the laugh brook where
the water wa veri shallow hardli over hi feet and there he sat
chuckl to himself thing happen just as he had expect the
frighten fish littl joe chase out of the littl pool up abov swam
down the laugh brook becaus you know littl joe wa behind them
and there wa nowher els for them to go when they came to the place
where buster wa wait all he had to do wa to scoop them out on to
the bank it wa great fun it didnt take buster long to catch all the
fish he could eat then he save a nice fat trout and wait

by and by along came littl joe otter chuckl to think how he had
spoil buster bear fish he wa so intent on look behind him to
see if buster wa come that he didnt see buster wait there until
he spoke

im much oblig for the fine breakfast you have given me said buster
in hi deepest most grumbly-rumbl voic ive save a fat trout for
you to make up for the one i ate yesterday i hope well go fish
togeth often

then he went off laugh fit to kill himself littl joe couldnt find
a word to say he wa so surpris and angri that he went off by himself
and sulk and billi mink who had been watch ate the fat trout




v

grandfath frog common-sens


there is noth quit like common sens to smooth out troubl peopl
who have plenti of just plain common sens are often thought to be veri
wise their neighbor look up to them and are forev run to them
for advic and they are veri much respect that is the way with
grandfath frog he is veri old and veri wise anyway that is what hi
neighbor think the truth is he simpli ha a lot of common sens
which after all is the veri best kind of wisdom

now when littl joe otter found that buster bear had been too smart for
him and that instead of spoil buster fish in the laugh brook
he had realli made it easier for buster to catch all the fish he want
littl joe went off down to the smile pool in a great rage

billi mink stop long enough to eat the fat fish buster had left on
the bank and then he too went down to the smile pool

when littl joe otter and billi mink reach the smile pool they
climb up on the big rock and there littl joe sulk and sulk
until final grandfath frog ask what the matter wa littl joe
wouldnt tell but billi mink told the whole stori when he told how
buster had been too smart for littl joe it tickl him so that billi
had to laugh in spite of himself so did grandfath frog so did jerri
muskrat who had been listen of cours thi made littl joe angrier
than ever he said a lot of unkind thing about buster bear and about
billi mink and grandfath frog and jerri muskrat becaus they had
laugh at the smart of buster

he noth but a great big bulli and thief! declar littl joe

chug-a-rum! he may be a bulli becaus great big peopl are veri apt to
be bulli and though i havent seen him i guess buster bear is big
enough from all i have heard but i dont see how he is a thief said
grandfath frog

didnt he catch my fish and eat them? snap littl joe doesnt
that make him a thief?

they were no more your fish than mine protest billi mink

well _our_ fish then! he stole _our_ fish if you like that ani
better that make him just as much a thief doesnt it? growl
littl joe

grandfath frog look up at jolli round bright mr sun and slowli
wink one of hi great goggli eye there come a foolish green fli
said he who doe he belong to?

nobody! snap littl joe what have foolish green fli got to do
with my--i mean _our_ fish?

noth noth at all repli grandfath frog mildli i wa just
hope that he would come near enough for me to snap him up; then he
would belong to me as long as he doesnt he doesnt belong to ani one
i suppos that if buster bear should happen along and catch him he
would be steal from me accord to littl joe

of cours not! what a silli idea! your get foolish in your old
age retort littl joe

can you tell me the differ between the fish that you havent caught
and the foolish green fli that i havent caught? ask grandfath
frog

littl joe couldnt find a word to say

you take my advic littl joe otter continu grandfath frog and
alway make friend with those who are bigger and stronger and smarter
than you are youll find it pay

[illustration: you take my advic littl joe otter continu
grandfath frog _page 26_]




vi

littl joe otter take grandfath frog advic


who make an enemi a friend
to fear and worri put an end

littl joe otter found that out when he took grandfath frog advic
he wouldnt have admit that he wa afraid of buster bear no one ever
like to admit be afraid least of all littl joe otter and realli
littl joe ha a great deal of courag veri few of the littl peopl of
the green forest or the green meadow would willingli quarrel with him
for littl joe is a great fighter when he ha to fight as for all those
who live in or along the laugh brook or in the smile pool they
let littl joe have hi own way in everyth

now have one own way too much is a bad thing it is apt to make one
selfish and thoughtless of other peopl and veri hard to get along with
littl joe otter had hi way too much grandfath frog knew it and
shook hi head veri soberli when littl joe had been disrespect to
him

too bad too bad! too bad! chug-a-rum! it is too bad that such a fine
young fellow as littl joe should spoil a good disposit by such
selfish heedless too bad said he

so though he didnt let on that it wa so grandfath frog realli wa
delight when he heard how buster bear had been too smart for littl
joe otter it tickl him so that he had hard work to keep a straight
face but he did and wa as grave and solemn as you pleas as he
advis littl joe alway to make friend with ani one who wa bigger
and stronger and smarter than he that wa good common sens advic but
littl joe just snif and went off declar that he would get even
with buster bear yet now littl joe is good-natur and full of fun as
a rule and after he had reach home and hi temper had cool off a
littl he began to see the joke on himself--how when he had work so
hard to frighten the fish in the littl pool of the laugh brook so
that buster bear should not catch ani he had all the time been drive
them right into buster paw by and by he grin it wa a littl
sheepish grin at first but at last it grew into a laugh

i believ said littl joe as he wipe tear of laughter from hi
eye that grandfath frog is right and that the best thing i can do
is to make friend with buster bear ill tri it to-morrow morn

so veri earli the next morn littl joe otter went to the best fish
pool he knew of in the laugh brook and there he caught the biggest
trout he could find it wa so big and fat that it made littl joe
mouth water for you know fat trout are hi favorit food but he didnt
take so much as one bite instead he care laid it on an old log
where buster bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that
way then he hid near by where he could watch buster wa late that
morn it seem to littl joe that he never would come onc he
nearli lost the fish he had turn hi head for just a minut and when
he look back again the trout wa nowher to be seen buster couldnt
have stolen up and taken it becaus such a big fellow couldnt possibl
have gotten out of sight again

littl joe dart over to the log and look on the other side there
wa the fat trout and there also wa littl joe smallest cousin
shadow the weasel who is a great thief and altogeth bad littl joe
sprang at him angrili but shadow wa too quick and dart away littl
joe put the fish back on the log and wait thi time he didnt take
hi eye off it at last when he wa almost readi to give up he saw
buster bear shuffl along toward the laugh brook suddenli buster
stop and snif one of the merri littl breez had carri the
scent of that fat trout over to him then he came straight over to where
the fish lay hi nose wrinkl and hi eye twinkl with pleasur

now i wonder who wa so thought as to leav thi fine breakfast
readi for me said he out loud

me said littl joe in a rather faint voic i caught it especi
for you

thank you repli buster and hi eye twinkl more than ever i
think we are go to be friend

i--i hope so repli littl joe

farmer brown boy ha no luck at all


farmer brown boy tramp through the green forest whistl merrili
he alway whistl when he feel light-heart and he alway feel
light-heart when he goe fish you see he is just as fond of
fish as is littl joe otter or billi mink or buster bear and now he
wa make hi way through the green forest to the laugh brook sure
that by the time he had follow it down to the smile pool he would
have a fine lot of trout to take home he knew everi pool in the
laugh brook where the trout love to hide did farmer brown boy
and it wa just the kind of a morn when the trout should be hungri
so he whistl as he tramp along and hi whistl wa good to hear

when he reach the first littl pool he bait hi hook veri care
and then take the greatest care to keep out of sight of ani trout
that might be in the littl pool he began to fish now farmer brown
boy learn a long time ago that to be a success fisherman one must
have a great deal of patienc so though he didnt get a bite right away
as he had expect to he wasnt the least bit discourag he kept veri
quiet and fish and fish patient wait for a foolish trout to
take hi hook but he didnt get so much as a nibbl either the trout
have lost their appetit or they have grown veri wise mutter farmer
brown boy as after a long time he move on to the next littl pool

there the same thing happen he wa veri patient veri veri patient
but hi patienc brought no reward not so much as the faintest kind of
a nibbl farmer brown boy trudg on to the next pool and there wa
a puzzl frown on hi freckl face such a thing never had happen
befor he didnt know what to make of it all the night befor he had
dream about the delici dinner of fri trout he would have the next
day and now--wel if he didnt catch some trout pretti soon that
splendid dinner would never be anyth but a dream

if i didnt know that nobodi els come fish here i should think
that somebodi had been here thi veri morn and caught all the fish or
els frighten them so that they are all in hide said he as he
trudg on to the next littl pool i never had such bad luck in all my
life befor hello! what this?

there on the bank besid the littl pool were the head of three
trout farmer brown boy scowl down at them more puzzl than ever
somebodi _has_ been fish here and they have had better luck than i
have thought he he look up the laugh brook and down the laugh
brook and thi way and that way but no one wa to be seen then he
pick up one of the littl head and look at it sharpli it wasnt
cut off with a knife; it wa bitten off! he exclaim i wonder now if
billi mink is the scamp who ha spoil my fun

thereaft he kept a sharp lookout for sign of billi mink but though
he found two or three more trout head he saw no other sign and he
caught no fish thi puzzl him more than ever it didnt seem possibl
that such a littl fellow as billi mink could have caught or frighten
all the fish or have eaten so mani besid he didnt rememb ever
have known billi to leav head around that way billi sometim
catch more fish than he can eat but then he usual hide them the
farther he went down the laugh brook the more puzzl farmer brown
boy grew it made him feel veri queer he would have felt still more
queer if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had been
befor him were watch him and chuckl to themselv they were
littl joe otter and buster bear

farmer brown boy feel hi hair rise


twa just a sudden odd surpris
made farmer brown boy hair to rise

that a funni thing for hair to do--ris up all of a sudden--isnt it?
but that is just what the hair on farmer brown boy head did the day
he went fish in the laugh brook and had no luck at all there are
just two thing that make hair rise--ang and fear anger sometim
make the hair on the back and neck of bowser the hound and of some
other littl peopl bristl and stand up and you know the hair on the
tail of black pussi stand on end until her tail look twice as big as
it realli is both anger and fear make it do that but there is onli one
thing that can make the hair on the head of farmer brown boy rise and
as it isnt anger of cours it must be fear

it never had happen befor you see there isnt much of anyth that
farmer brown boy is realli afraid of perhap he wouldnt have been
afraid thi time if it hadnt been for the surpris of what he found
you see when he had found the head of those trout on the bank he knew
right away that some one els had been fish and that wa whi he
couldnt catch any; but it didnt seem possibl that littl billi mink
could have eaten all those trout and farmer brown boy didnt onc
think of littl joe otter and so he wa veri veri much puzzl

he wa turn it all over in hi mind and studi what it could mean
when he came to a littl muddi place on the bank of the laugh brook
and there he saw someth that made hi eye look as if they would pop
right out of hi head and it wa right then that he felt hi hair rise
anyway that is what he said when he told about it afterward what wa
it he saw? what do you think? whi it wa a footprint in the soft mud
ye sir that what it wa and all it wa but it wa the biggest
footprint farmer brown boy ever had seen and it look as if it had
been made onli a few minut befor it wa the footprint of buster
bear

now farmer brown boy didnt know that buster bear had come down to the
green forest to live he never had heard of a bear be in the green
forest and so he wa so surpris that he had hard work to believ hi
own eye and he had a queer feel all over--a littl chilli feel
although it wa a warm day somehow he didnt feel like meet buster
bear if he had had hi terribl gun with him it might have been
differ but he didnt and so he suddenli made up hi mind that he
didnt want to fish ani more that day he had a funni feel too that
he wa be watch although he couldnt see ani one he _was_ be
watch littl joe otter and buster bear were watch him and take
the greatest care to keep out of hi sight

all the way home through the green forest farmer brown boy kept
look behind him and he didnt draw a long breath until he reach
the edg of the green forest he hadnt run but he had want to

huh! said buster bear to littl joe otter i believ he wa afraid!

and buster bear wa just exactli right




ix

contain himself he felt that he had the greatest news to tell sinc

forest he couldnt keep it to himself a minut longer than he had to
so he hurri to the smile pool where he wa sure he would find billi
mink and jerri muskrat and grandfath frog and spotti the turtl and
he hope that perhap some of the littl peopl who live in the green
forest might be there too sure enough peter rabbit wa there on one
side of the smile pool make face at reddi fox who wa on the
other side which of cours wa not at all nice of peter mr and mr

hi eye from farmer brown back door what wa he watch for? whi
for farmer brown boy to come out on hi way to milk the cow

farmer brown boy in each hand he carri a milk pail right away
blacki began to scream at the top of hi lung caw caw caw! shout
blacki caw caw caw! and all the time he flew about among the tree
near the edg of the green forest as if so excit that he couldnt keep
still farmer brown boy look over there as if he wonder what all

and see no sir he start straight for the barn

blacki didnt know what to make of it you see smart as he is and
shrewd as he is blacki doesnt know anyth about the mean of duti
for he never ha to work except to get enough to eat so when farmer
brown boy start for the barn instead of for the green forest
blacki didnt know what to make of it he scream harder and louder
than ever until hi voic grew so hoars he couldnt scream ani more
but farmer brown boy kept right on to the barn

id like to know what your make such a fuss about mr crow but
ive got to feed the cow and milk them first said he

now all thi time the other littl peopl of the green forest and the
green meadow had been hide where they could see all that went on
when farmer brown boy disappear in the barn chatter the red

place where blacki and sammi were make such a racket he walk veri
softli so as not to make a sound it wa buster bear




xiii

farmer brown boy and buster bear meet


if you should meet with buster bear
while walk through the wood
what would you do? now tell me true
_id_ run the best i could

that is what farmer brown boy did when he met buster bear and a lot
of the littl peopl of the green forest and some from the green meadow
saw him when farmer brown boy came hurri home from the laugh
brook without ani fish one day and told about the great footprint he had
seen in a muddi place on the bank deep in the green forest and had said
hi wa sure that it wa the footprint of a bear he had been laugh
at farmer brown had laugh and laugh

whi said he there hasnt been a bear in the green forest for year
and year and year not sinc my own grandfath wa a littl boy and
that you know wa a long long long time ago if you want to find mr
bear you will have to go to the great wood i dont know who made that
footprint but it certainli couldnt have been a bear i think you must
have imagin it

then he had laugh some more all of which goe to show how easi it is
to be mistaken and how foolish it is to laugh at thing you realli
dont know about buster bear _had_ come to live in the green forest
and farmer brown boy _had_ seen hi footprint but farmer brown
laugh so much and made fun of him so much that at last hi boy began
to think that he must have been mistaken after all so when he heard
blacki the crow and sammi jay make a great fuss near the edg of the
green forest he never onc thought of buster bear as he start over
to see what wa go on

when blacki and sammi saw him come they move a littl farther in to
the green forest still scream in the most excit way they felt
sure that farmer brown boy would follow them and they meant to lead
him to where sammi had seen buster bear that morn then they would
find out for sure if what littl joe otter had said wa true--that
farmer brown boy realli wa afraid of buster bear

now all around behind tree and stump and under thick branch and
even in tree top were other littl peopl watch with round
wide-open eye to see what would happen it wa veri excit the most
excit thing they could rememb you see they had come to believ
that farmer brown boy wasnt afraid of anybodi or anyth and as
most of them were veri much afraid of him they had hard work to believ
that he would realli be afraid of even such a great big strong fellow
as buster bear everi one wa so busi watch farmer brown boy that
no one saw buster come from the other direct

you see buster walk veri softli big as he is he can walk without
make the teeniest weeniest sound and that is how it happen that no
one saw him or heard him until just as farmer brown boy step out
from behind one side of a thick littl hemlock-tre buster bear step
out from behind the other side of that same littl tree and there they
were face to face! then everybodi held their breath even blacki the
crow and sammi jay for just a littl minut it wa so still there in
the green forest that not the least littl sound could be heard what
wa go to happen?




xiv

a surpris thing happen


blacki the crow and sammi jay look down from the top of a tall tree
held their breath happi jack the gray squirrel and hi cousin
chatter the red squirrel look down from anoth tree held _their_
breath unc billi possum stick hi head out from a hollow tree
held _his_ breath bobbi coon look through a hole in a hollow stump
in which he wa hide held _his_ breath reddi fox lie flat down
behind a heap of brush held _his_ breath peter rabbit sit bolt
upright under a thick hemlock branch with eye and ear wide open held
_his_ breath and all the other littl peopl who happen to be where
they could see did the same thing

you see it wa the most excit moment ever wa in the green forest
farmer brown boy had just step out from behind one side of a littl
hemlock-tre and buster bear had just step out from behind the
opposit side of the littl hemlock-tre and neither had known that the
other wa anywher near for a whole minut they stood there face to
face gaze into each other eye while everybodi watch and wait
and it seem as if the whole green forest wa hold it breath

then someth happen ye sir someth happen farmer brown
boy open hi mouth and yelled! it wa such a sudden yell and such a
loud yell that it startl chatter so that he nearli fell from hi
place in the tree and it made reddi fox jump to hi feet readi to run
and that yell wa a yell of fright there wa no doubt about it for
with the yell farmer brown boy turn and ran for home as no one ever
had seen him run befor he ran just as peter rabbit run when he ha
got to reach the dear old briar-patch befor reddi fox can catch him
which you know is as fast as he can run onc he stumbl and fell
but he scrambl to hi feet in a twinkl and away he went without
onc turn hi head to see if buster bear wa after him there wasnt
ani doubt that he wa afraid veri much afraid

everybodi lean forward to watch him what did i tell you? didnt i
say that he wa afraid of buster bear? cri littl joe otter danc
about with excit

you were right littl joe! im sorri that i doubt it see him go!
caw caw caw! shriek blacki the crow

for a minut or two everybodi forgot about buster bear then there wa a
great crash which made everybodi turn to look the other way what do you
think they saw? whi buster bear wa run away too and he wa
run twice as fast as farmer brown boy! he bump into tree and
crash through bush and jump over log and in almost no time at
all he wa out of sight altogeth it wa the most surpris thing
that the littl peopl of the green forest ever had seen

[illustration: buster bear wa run away too page _71_]

sammi jay look at blacki the crow and blacki look at chatter
and chatter look at happi jack and happi jack look at peter
rabbit and peter look at unc billi possum and unc billi look at
bobbi coon and bobbi look at johnni chuck and johnni look at reddi
fox and reddi look at jimmi skunk and jimmi look at billi mink
and billi look at littl joe otter and for a minut nobodi could say
a word then littl joe gave a funni littl gasp

whi why-e-e! said he i believ buster bear is afraid too! unc
billi possum chuckl ah believ yo are right again brer otter
said he it certnli doe look so if brer bear isnt scare he must
have rememb someth impot and ha gone to attend to it in a
power hurri

then everybodi began to laugh




xv

buster bear is a fallen hero


a fallen hero is some one to whom everi one ha look up as veri brave
and then prove to be less brave than he wa suppos to be that wa
the way with buster bear when littl joe otter had told how farmer
brown boy had been afraid at the mere sight of one of buster bear
big footprint they had at onc made a hero of buster at least some of
them had as thi wa the first time the veri first time that they had
ever known ani one who live in the green forest to make farmer brown
boy run away they look on buster bear with a great deal of respect
and were veri proud of him

but now they had seen buster bear and farmer brown boy meet face to
face; and while it wa true that farmer brown boy had run away as fast
as ever he could it wa also true that buster bear had done the same
thing he had run even faster than farmer brown boy and had hidden in
the most lone place he could find in the veri deepest part of the
green forest it wa hard to believ but it wa true and right away
everybodi lost a great deal of the respect for buster which they had
felt it is alway that way they began to say unkind thing about him
they said them among themselv and some of them even said them to
buster when they met him or said them so that he would hear them

of cours blacki the crow and sammi jay who becaus they can fli
have noth to fear from buster and who alway delight in make other
peopl uncomfort never let a chanc go by to tell buster and
everybodi els within hear what they thought of him they delight
in fli about through the green forest until they had found buster
bear and then from the safeti of the tree top scream at him

buster bear is big and strong;
hi teeth are big; hi claw are long;
in spite of these he run away
and hide himself the livelong day!

a dozen time a day buster would hear them scream thi he would
grind hi teeth and glare up at them but that wa all he could do he
couldnt get at them he just had to stand it and do noth but when
impud littl chatter the red squirrel shout the same thing from
a place just out of reach in a big pine-tre buster could stand it no
longer he gave a deep angri growl that made littl shiver run over
chatter and then suddenli he start up that tree after chatter
with a frighten littl shriek chatter scamper to the top of the
tree he hadnt known that buster could climb but buster is a splendid
climber especi when the tree is big and stout as thi one wa and
now he went up after chatter growl angrili

how chatter did wish that he had kept hi tongu still! he ran to the
veri top of the tree so frighten that hi teeth chatter and when
he look down and saw buster great mouth come nearer and nearer he
nearli tumbl down with terror the worst of it wa there wasnt
anoth tree near enough for him to jump to he wa in troubl thi
time wa chatter sure enough! and there wa no one to help him




xvi

chatter the red squirrel jump for hi life


it isnt veri often that chatter the red squirrel know fear that is
one reason that he is so often impud and sauci but onc in a while a
great fear take possess of him as when he know that shadow the
weasel is look for him you see he know that shadow can go wherev
he can go there are veri few of the littl peopl of the green forest
and the green meadow who do not know fear at some time or other but it
come to chatter as seldom as to ani one becaus he is veri sure of
himself and hi abil to hide or run away from danger

but now as he clung to a littl branch near the top of a tall pine-tre
in the green forest and look down at the big sharp teeth of buster
bear draw nearer and nearer and listen to the deep angri growl
that made hi hair stand on end chatter wa too frighten to think
if onli he had kept hi tongu still instead of say hate thing to
buster bear! if onli he had known that buster could climb a tree! if
onli he had chosen a tree near enough to other tree for him to jump
across! but he _had_ said hate thing he _had_ chosen to sit in a
tree which stood quit by itself and buster bear _could_ climb!
chatter wa in the worst kind of troubl and there wa no one to
blame but himself that is usual the case with those who get into
troubl

nearer and nearer came buster bear and deeper and angrier sound hi
voic chatter gave a littl frighten gasp and look thi way and
look that way what should he do? what _could_ he do! the ground
seem a terribl distanc below if onli he had wing like sammi jay!
but he hadnt

gr-r-r-r! growl buster bear ill teach you manners! ill teach you
to treat your better with respect! ill swallow you whole that what
ill do gr-r-r-r!

oh! cri chatter

gr-r-r-r! ill eat you all up to the last hair on your tail! growl
buster scrambl a littl nearer

oh! oh! cri chatter and ran out to the veri tip of the littl
branch to which he had been cling now if chatter had onli known
it buster bear couldnt reach him way up there becaus the tree wa
too small at the top for such a big fellow as buster but chatter
didnt think of that he gave one more frighten look down at those big
teeth then he shut hi eye and jumped--jump straight out for the
far-away ground

it wa a long long long way down to the ground and it certainli
look as if such a littl fellow as chatter must be kill but
chatter had learn from old mother natur that she had given him
certain thing to help him at just such time and one of them is the
power to spread himself veri flat he did it now he spread hi arm and
leg out just as far as he could and that kept him from fall as fast
and as hard as he otherwis would have done becaus be spread out so
flat that way the air held him up a littl and then there wa hi
tail that funni littl tail he is so fond of jerk when he scold
thi help him too it help him keep hi balanc and keep from
turn over and over

down down down he sail and land on hi feet of cours he hit the
ground pretti hard and for just a second he quit lost hi breath but
it wa onli for a second and then he wa scurri off as fast as a
frighten squirrel could buster bear watch him and grin

i didnt catch him that time he growl but i guess i gave him a
good fright and taught him a lesson

buster bear goe berri


buster bear is a great hand to talk to himself when he think no one is
around to overhear it a habit howev it isnt a bad habit unless
it is carri too far ani habit becom bad if it is carri too far
suppos you had a secret a real secret someth that nobodi els knew
and that you didnt want anybodi els to know and suppos you had the
habit of talk to yourself you might without think you know
tell that secret out loud to yourself and some one might just might
happen to overhear! then there wouldnt be ani secret that is the way
that a habit which isnt bad in itself can becom bad when it is
carri too far

now buster bear had live by himself in the great wood so long that
thi habit of talk to himself had grown and grown he did it just to
keep from be lonesom of cours when he came down to the green
forest to live he brought all hi habit with him that is one thing
about habits--y alway take them with you wherev you go so buster
brought thi habit of talk to himself down to the green forest where
he had mani more neighbor than he had in the great wood

let me see let me see what is there to tempt my appetite? said
buster in hi deep grumbly-rumbl voic i find my appetit isnt what
it ought to be i need a chang ye sir i need a chang there is
someth i ought to have at thi time of year and i havent got it
there is someth that i use to have and dont have now ha! i know! i
need some fresh fruit that it--fresh fruit! it must be about berri
time now and id forgotten all about it my my my how good some
berri would taste! now if i were back up there in the great wood i
could have all i could eat um-m-m-m! make my mouth water just to think
of it there ought to be some up in the old pastur there ought to be a
lot of em up there if i wasnt afraid that some one would see me id
go up there

buster sigh then he sigh again the more he thought about those
berri he felt sure were grow in the old pastur the more he want
some it seem to him that never in all hi life had he want berri
as he did now he wander about uneasili he wa hungry--hungri for
berri and noth els by and by he began talk to himself again

if i wasnt afraid of be seen id go up to the old pastur thi
veri minut seem as if i could tast those berri he lick hi
lip hungrili as he spoke then hi face brighten i know what ill
do! ill go up there at the veri first peep of day to-morrow i can eat
all i want and get back to the green forest befor there is ani danger
that farmer brown boy or ani one els im afraid of will see me
that just what ill do my i wish to-morrow morn would hurri up
and come

now though buster didnt know it some one had been listen and that
some one wa none other than sammi jay when at last buster lay down
for a nap sammi flew away chuckl to himself i believ ill visit
the old pastur to-morrow morn myself thought he i have an idea
that someth interest may happen if buster doesnt chang hi
mind

sammi wa on the lookout veri earli the next morn the first jolli
littl sunbeam had onli reach the green meadow and had not start
to creep into the green forest when he saw a big dark form steal out
of the green forest where it join the old pastur it move veri
swiftli and silent as if in a great hurri sammi knew who it was: it
wa buster bear and he wa go berri sammi wait a littl until
he could see better then he too start for the old pastur




xviii

somebodi els goe berri


isnt it funni how two peopl will often think of the same thing at the
same time and neither one know that the other is think of it? that
is just what happen the day that buster bear first thought of go
berri while he wa walk around in the green forest talk to
himself about how hungri he wa for some berri and how sure he wa
that there must be some up in the old pastur some one els wa
think about berri and about the old pastur too

will you make me a berri pie if i will get the berri to-morrow?
ask farmer brown boy of hi mother

of cours mr brown promis that she would and so that night farmer
brown boy went to bed veri earli that he might get up earli in the
morn and all night long he dream of berri and berri pie he wa
awak even befor jolli round red mr sun thought it wa time to get
up and he wa all readi to start for the old pastur when the first
jolli littl sunbeam came danc across the green meadow he carri
a big tin pail and in the bottom of it wrap up in a piec of paper
wa a lunch for he meant to stay until he fill that pail if it took
all day

now the old pastur is veri larg it lie at the foot of the big
mountain and even extend a littl way up on the big mountain there is
room in it for mani peopl to pick berri all day without even see
each other unless they roam about a great deal you see the bush
grow veri thick there and you cannot see veri far in ani direct
jolli round red mr sun had climb a littl way up in the sky by the
time farmer brown boy reach the old pastur and wa smile down on
all the great world and all the great world seem to be smile back
farmer brown boy start to whistl and then he stop

if i whistl thought he everybodi will know just where i am and
will keep out of sight and i never can get acquaint with folk if
they keep out of sight

you see farmer brown boy wa just begin to understand someth
that peter rabbit and the other littl peopl of the green meadow and
the green forest learn almost as soon as they learn to walk--that
if you dont want to be seen you mustnt be heard so he didnt
whistl as he felt like do and he tri not to make a bit of nois
as he follow an old cow-path toward a place where he knew the berri
grew thick and oh so big and all the time he kept hi eye wide open
and he kept hi ear open too

that is how he happen to hear a littl cri a veri faint littl cri
if he had been whistl he wouldnt have heard it at all he stop
to listen he never had heard a cri just like it befor at first he
couldnt make out just what it wa or where it came from but one thing
he wa sure of and that wa that it wa a cri of fright he stood
perfectli still and listen with all hi might there it wa
again--help! help! help--and it wa veri faint and sound terribl
frighten he wait a minut or two but heard noth more then he
put down hi pail and began a hurri look here there and everywher
he wa sure that it had come from somewher on the ground so he peer
behind bush and peep behind log and stone and then just as he had
about given up hope of find where it came from he went around a
littl turn in the old cow-path and there right in front of him wa
littl mr gartersnak and what do you think he wa doing? well i
dont like to tell you but he wa tri to swallow one of the children
of stickyto the tree toad of cours farmer brown boy didnt let
him he made littl mr gartersnak set master stickyto free and held
mr gartersnak until master stickyto wa safe out of reach




xix

buster bear ha a fine time


buster bear wa have the finest time he had had sinc he came down
from the great wood to live in the green forest to be sure he wasnt
in the green forest now but he wasnt far from it he wa in the old
pastur one edg of which touch one edg of the green forest and
where do you think he wa in the old pasture? whi right in the middl
of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberri he ever had seen in all
hi life! now if there is ani one thing that buster bear had rather have
abov anoth it is all the berri he can eat unless it be honey
noth can quit equal honey in buster mind but next to honey give
him berri he isnt particular what kind of berri raspberri
blackberri or blueberri either kind will make him perfectli
happi

um-m-m my my but these are good! he mumbl in hi deep
grumbly-rumbl voic as he sat on hi haunch strip off the
berri greedili hi littl eye twinkl with enjoy and he didnt
mind at all if now and then he got leav and some green berri in hi
mouth with the big ripe berri he didnt tri to get them out oh my
no! he just chomp them all up togeth and pat hi stomach from
sheer delight now buster had reach the old pastur just as jolli
round red mr sun had crept out of bed and he had fulli made up hi
mind that he would be back in the green forest befor mr sun had
climb veri far up in the blue blue sky you see big as he is and
strong as he is buster bear is veri shi and bash and he ha no
desir to meet farmer brown or farmer brown boy or ani other of
those two-leg creatur call men it seem funni but he actual is
afraid of them and he had a feel that he wa a great deal more
like to meet one of them in the old pastur than deep in the green
forest

so when he start to look for berri he made up hi mind that he
would eat what he could in a great hurri and get back to the green
forest befor farmer brown boy wa more than out of bed but when he
found those berri he wa so hungri that he forgot hi fear and
everyth els they tast so good that he just had to eat and eat
and eat now you know that buster is a veri big fellow and it take a
lot to fill him up he kept eat and eat and eat and the more
he ate the more he want you know how it is so he wander from one
patch of berri to anoth in the old pastur and never onc thought
of the time somehow time is the hardest thing in the world to
rememb when you are have a good time

jolli round red mr sun climb higher and higher in the blue blue
sky he look down on all the great world and saw all that wa go
on he saw buster bear in the old pastur and smile as he saw what a
perfectli gloriou time buster wa have and he saw someth els in
the old pastur that made hi smile still broader he saw farmer brown
boy fill a great tin pail with blueberri and he knew that farmer
brown boy didnt know that buster bear wa anywher about and he knew
that buster bear didnt know that farmer brown boy wa anywher about
and somehow he felt veri sure that he would see someth funni happen

buster bear carri off the pail of farmer brown boy


the question is did buster bear steal farmer brown boy pail? to
steal is to take someth which belong to some one els there is no
doubt that he stole the berri that were in the pail when he found it
for he deliber ate them he knew well enough that some one must
have pick them--for whoever heard of blueberri grow in tin pails?
so there is no doubt that when buster took them he stole them but with
the pail it wa differ he took the pail but he didnt mean to take
it in fact he didnt want that pail at all

you see it wa thi way: when buster found that big tin pail brim
full of delici berri in the shade of that big bush in the old
pastur he didnt stop to think whether or not he had a right to them
buster is so fond of berri that from the veri second that hi greedi
littl eye saw that pail he forgot everyth but the feast that
wa wait for him right under hi veri nose he didnt think anyth
about the right or wrong of help himself there befor him were more
berri than he had ever seen togeth at one time in all hi life and
all he had to do wa to eat and eat and eat and that is just what he
did do of cours he upset the pail but he didnt mind a littl thing
like that when he had gobbl up all the berri that roll out he
thrust hi nose into the pail to get all that were left in it just
then he heard a littl nois as if some one were come he threw up
hi head to listen and somehow he never did know just how the handl
of the pail slip back over hi ear and caught there

thi wa bad enough but to make matter wors just at that veri minut
he heard a shrill angri voic shout hi there! get out of there! he
didnt need to be told whose voic that wa it wa the voic of farmer
brown boy right then and there buster bear nearli had a fit there
wa that aw pail fast over hi head so that he couldnt see a thing
of cours that meant that he couldnt run away which wa the thing of
all thing he most want to do for big as he is and strong as he is
buster is veri shi and bash when human be are around he growl
and whine and squeal he tri to back out of the pail and couldnt
he tri to shake it off and couldnt he tri to pull it off but
somehow he couldnt get hold of it then there wa anoth yell if
buster hadnt been so frighten himself he might have recogn that
second yell as one of fright for that is what it wa you see farmer
brown boy had just discov buster bear when he had yell the
first time he had suppos that it wa one of the young cattl who live
in the old pastur all summer but when he saw buster he wa just as
badli frighten as buster himself in fact he wa too surpris and
frighten even to run after that second yell he just stood still and
stare

buster claw at that aw thing on hi head more frantic than
ever suddenli it slip off so that he could see he gave one
frighten look at farmer brown boy and then with a mighti woof! he
start for the green forest as fast as hi leg could take him and
thi wa veri fast inde let me tell you he didnt stop to pick out a
path but just crash through the bush as if they were noth at
all just noth at all but the funniest thing of all is this--h took
that pail with him! ye sir buster bear ran away with the big tin pail
of farmer brown boy! you see when it slip off hi head the handl
wa still around hi neck and there he wa run away with a pail
hang from hi neck! he didnt want it he would have given anyth
to get rid of it but he took it becaus he couldnt help it and that
bring us back to the question did buster steal farmer brown boy
pail? what do you think?

green meadow and the smile pool are so use to hear sammi cri
thief that usual they think veri littl about it but everi bless
one who heard sammi thi morn stop whatev he wa do and
prick up hi ear to listen

sammi cousin blacki the crow just happen to be fli along the
edg of the old pastur and the minut he heard sammi voic he
turn and flew over to see what it wa all about just as soon as he
caught sight of buster bear run for the green forest as hard as ever

thief thief thief! at the top of hi lung and behind him blacki
the crow tri to catch up and yell as loud as he could caw
caw caw! come on everybody! come on! come on!

poor buster! it wa bad enough to be frighten almost to death as he
had been up in the old pastur when the pail had caught over hi head
just as farmer brown boy had yell at him then to have the handl of
the pail slip down around hi neck so that he couldnt get rid of the
pail but had to take it with him as he ran wa make a bad matter
wors now to have all hi neighbor of the green forest see him in such
a fix and make fun of him wa more than he could stand he felt
humili that is just anoth way of say shame ye sir buster
felt that he wa shame in the eye of hi neighbor and he want
noth so much as to get away by himself where no one could see him
and tri to get rid of that dread pail but buster is so big that it
is not easi for him to find a hide place so when he reach the
green forest he kept right on to the deepest darkest most lonesom
part and crept under the thickest hemlock-tre he could find

but it wa of no use the sharp eye of sammi jay and blacki the crow
saw him they actual flew into the veri tree under which he wa
hide and how they did scream! pretti soon ol mistah buzzard came
drop down out of the blue blue sky and took a seat on a conveni
dead tree where he could see all that went on ol mistah buzzard began
to grin as soon as he saw that tin pail on buster neck then came
others--redtail the hawk scrapper the kingbird redw the blackbird
drummer the woodpeck welcom robin tommi tit the chickade jenni
wren redey the vireo and ever so mani more they came from the old
orchard the green meadow and even down by the smile pool for the
voic of sammi jay and blacki the crow carri far and at the sound of
them everybodi hurri over sure that someth excit wa go on

present buster heard light footstep and peep out he saw billi
mink and peter rabbit and jumper the hare and prickli porki and reddi
fox and jimmi skunk even timid littl whitefoot the wood mous wa
where he could peer out and see without be seen of cours chatter
the red squirrel and happi jack the gray squirrel were there there they
all sat in a great circl around him each where he felt safe but where
he could see and everi one of them laugh and make fun of buster

thief thief thief! scream sammi until hi throat wa sore the
worst of it wa buster knew that everybodi knew that it wa true that
aw pail wa proof of it

i wish i never had thought of berri growl buster to himself

a temper is a bad bad thing
when onc it get away
there noth quit at all like it
to spoil a pleasant day

buster bear wa in a terribl temper ye sir buster bear wa have
the worst fit of temper ever seen in the green forest and the worst
part of it all wa that all hi neighbor of the green forest and a
whole lot from the green meadow and the smile pool were also there to
see it it is bad enough to give way to temper when you are all alon
and there is no one to watch you but when you let temper get the best
of you right where other see you oh dear dear it certainli is a
sorri sight

now ordinarili buster is one of the most good-natur person in the
world it take a great deal to rous hi temper he isnt one tenth so
quick temper as chatter the red squirrel or sammi jay or reddi
fox but when hi temper is arous and get away from him then watch
out! it seem to buster that he had had all that he could stand that
day and a littl more first had come the fright back there in the old
pastur then the pail had slip down behind hi ear and held fast
so he had run all the way to the green forest with it hang about hi
neck thi wa bad enough for he knew just how funni he must look and
besid it wa veri uncomfort but to have sammi jay call everybodi
within hear to come and see him wa more than he could stand it
seem to buster as if everybodi who live in the green forest on the
green meadow or around the smile brook wa sit around hi
hide place laugh and make fun of him it wa more than ani
self-respect bear could stand

with a roar of anger buster bear charg out of hi hide place he
rush thi way and that way! he roar with all hi might! he wa veri
terribl to see those who could fli flew those who could climb
climb and those who were swift of foot ran a few who could neither
fli nor climb nor run fast hid and lay shake and trembl for fear
that buster would find them in less time than it take to tell about
it buster wa alon at least he couldnt see ani one

[illustration: those who could fli flew those who could climb
climb _page 112_]

then he vent hi temper on the tin pail he cuf at it and pull at
it all the time growl angrili he lay down and claw at it with hi
hind feet at last the handl broke and he wa free! he shook himself
then he jump on the helpless pail with a blow of a big paw he sent it
clatter against a tree he tri to bite it then he onc more fell
to knock it thi way and that way until it wa pound flat and no
one would ever have guess that it had onc been a pail

then and not till then did buster recov hi usual good natur
littl by littl as he thought it all over a look of shame crept into
hi face i--i guess it wasnt the fault of that thing i ought to have
known enough to keep my head out of it he said slowli and
thought

you got no more than you deserv for steal farmer brown boy
berri said sammi jay who had come back and wa look on from the
top of a tree you ought to know by thi time that no good come of
steal

buster bear look up and grin and there wa a twinkl in hi eye
you ought to know sammi jay said he i hope youll alway rememb
it

thief thief thief! scream sammi and flew away

farmer brown boy lunch on berri


when thing go wrong in spite of you
to smile the best thing you can do--
to smile and say im mighti glad
they are no worse; theyr not so bad!

that is what farmer brown boy said when he found that buster bear had
stolen the berri he had work so hard to pick and then had run off
with the pail you see farmer brown boy is learn to be someth
of a philosoph one of those peopl who accept bad thing cheer
and right away see how they are better than they might have been when
he had first heard some one in the bush where he had hidden hi pail
of berri he had been veri sure that it wa one of the cow or young
cattl who live in the old pastur dure the summer he had been afraid
that they might stupidli kick over the pail and spill the berri and
he had hurri to drive whoever it wa away it hadnt enter hi head
that it could be anybodi who would eat those berri

when he had yell and buster bear had suddenli appear struggl to
get off the pail which had caught over hi head farmer brown boy had
been too frighten to even move then he had seen buster tear away
through the brush even more frighten than he wa and right away hi
courag had begun to come back

if he is so afraid of me i guess i neednt be afraid of him said
he ive lost my berri but it is worth it to find out that he is
afraid of me there are plenti more on the bush and all ive got to
do is to pick them it might be wors

he walk over to the place where the pail had been and then he
rememb that when buster ran away he had carri the pail with him
hang about hi neck he whistl it wa a comic littl whistl of
chagrin as he realiz that he had noth in which to put more berri
even if he pick them it wors than i thought cri he that
bear ha cheat me out of that berri pie my mother promis me then
he began to laugh as he thought of how funni buster bear had look
with the pail about hi neck and then becaus you know he is learn
to be a philosoph he onc more repeat it might have been wors
ye inde it might have been wors that bear might have tri to eat
me instead of the berri i guess ill go eat that lunch i left back by
the spring and then ill go home i can pick berri some other day

chuckl happili over buster bear great fright farmer brown boy
tramp back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwich on a
flat stone when he start to save hi pail of berri my but those
sandwich will tast good thought he im glad they are big and
thick i never wa hungrier in my life hello! thi he exclaim right
out loud for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the
sandwich should have been and they were not there no sir there
wasnt so much as a crumb left of those two thick sandwich you see
old man coyot had found them and gobbl them up while farmer brown
boy wa away

but farmer brown boy didnt know anyth about old man coyot he
rub hi eye and stare everywher even up in the tree as if he
thought those sandwich might be hang up there they had disappear
as complet as if they never had been and old man coyot had taken
care to leav no trace of hi visit farmer brown boy gape foolishli
thi way and that way then instead of grow angri a slow smile
stole over hi freckl face i guess some one els wa hungri too he
mutter wonder who it was? guess thi old pastur is no place for me
to-day ill fill up on berri and then ill go home

so farmer brown boy made hi lunch on blueberri and then rather
sheepishli he start for home to tell of all the strang thing that
had happen to him in the old pastur two or three time as he
trudg along he stop to scratch hi head thought i guess
said he at last that im not so smart as i thought i wa and ive got
a lot to learn yet

thi is the end of the adventur of buster bear in thi book
because--guess whi becaus old mr toad insist that i must write a
book about hi adventur and old mr toad is such a good friend of all
of us that i am go to do it
