ever with pleasd smile i may keep on
ever and ever yet the vers owning--a first i here and now
sign for soul and bodi set to them my name

6
the soul
forev and forever--long than soil is brown and solid--long
than water ebb and flow
i will make the poem of materi for i think they are to be the
most spiritu poem
and i will make the poem of my bodi and of mortal
for i think i shall then suppli myself with the poem of my soul and
of immort

i will make a song for these state that no one state may under ani
circumst be subject to anoth state
and i will make a song that there shall be comiti by day and by
night between all the state and between ani two of them
and i will make a song for the ear of the presid full of
weapon with menac point
and behind the weapon countless dissatisfi faces;
and a song make i of the one formd out of all

resolut warlik one includ and over all

i make the poem of evil also i commemor that part also
i am myself just as much evil as good and my nation is--and i say
there is in fact no evil
(or if there is i say it is just as import to you to the land or

i too follow mani and followd by mani inaugur a religion i
descend into the arena
(it may be i am destind to utter the loudest cri there the
winner peal shout
who knows? they may rise from me yet and soar abov everi thing)

each is not for it own sake
i say the whole earth and all the star in the sky are for religion sake

i say no man ha ever yet been half devout enough
none ha ever yet ador or worshipd half enough
none ha begun to think how divin he himself is and how certain
the futur is

i say that the real and perman grandeur of these state must be
their religion
otherwis there is just no real and perman grandeur;
(nor charact nor life worthi the name without religion
nor land nor man or woman without religion)

8

to tell you with courag clear voic to prove you illustri
and i will show that there is no imperfect in the present and
can be none in the futur
and i will show that whatev happen to anybodi it may be turnd to
beauti result
and i will show that noth can happen more beauti than death
and i will thread a thread through my poem that time and event are
compact
and that all the thing of the univers are perfect miracl each
as profound as ani

i will not make poem with refer to part
but i will make poem song thought with refer to ensembl
and i will not sing with refer to a day but with refer to

and i will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but ha

} song of myself

1
i celebr myself and sing myself
and what i assum you shall assum
for everi atom belong to me as good belong to you

i loaf and invit my soul
i lean and loaf at my eas observ a spear of summer grass

my tongu everi atom of my blood formd from thi soil thi air
born here of parent born here from parent the same and their
parent the same
i now thirty-seven year old in perfect health begin
hope to ceas not till death

creed and school in abey
retir back a while suffic at what they are but never forgotten
i harbor for good or bad i permit to speak at everi hazard
natur without check with origin energi

2
hous and room are full of perfum the shelv are crowd with
perfum
i breath the fragranc myself and know it and like it
the distil would intox me also but i shall not let it

the atmospher is not a perfum it ha no tast of the
distil it is odorless
it is for my mouth forev i am in love with it
i will go to the bank by the wood and becom undisguis and nake
i am mad for it to be in contact with me

the smoke of my own breath
echo rippl buzzd whisper love-root silk-thread crotch and vine
my respir and inspir the beat of my heart the pass
of blood and air through my lung
the sniff of green leav and dri leav and of the shore and
dark-colord sea-rock and of hay in the barn

the sound of the belchd word of my voic loosd to the eddi of
the wind
a few light kiss a few embrac a reach around of arm
the play of shine and shade on the tree as the suppl bough wag
the delight alon or in the rush of the street or along the field
and hill-sid
the feel of health the full-noon trill the song of me rise
from bed and meet the sun

have you reckond a thousand acr much? have you reckond the earth much?
have you practisd so long to learn to read?
have you felt so proud to get at the mean of poems?

stop thi day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of
all poem
you shall possess the good of the earth and sun (there are million
of sun left)
you shall no longer take thing at second or third hand nor look through
the eye of the dead nor feed on the spectr in book
you shall not look through my eye either nor take thing from me
you shall listen to all side and filter them from your self

3
i have heard what the talker were talk the talk of the
begin and the end
but i do not talk of the begin or the end

there wa never ani more incept than there is now
nor ani more youth or age than there is now
and will never be ani more perfect than there is now
nor ani more heaven or hell than there is now

urg and urg and urg
alway the procreant urg of the world

out of the dim opposit equal advanc alway substanc and
increas alway sex
alway a knit of ident alway distinct alway a breed of life
to elabor is no avail learnd and unlearnd feel that it is so

sure as the most certain sure plumb in the upright well
entreti brace in the beam
stout as a hors affection haughti electr
i and thi mysteri here we stand

clear and sweet is my soul and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul

lack one lack both and the unseen is prove by the seen
till that becom unseen and receiv proof in it turn

show the best and divid it from the worst age vex age
know the perfect fit and equanim of thing while they
discuss i am silent and go bath and admir myself

welcom is everi organ and attribut of me and of ani man hearti and clean
not an inch nor a particl of an inch is vile and none shall be
less familiar than the rest

i am satisfied--i see danc laugh sing;
as the hug and love bed-fellow sleep at my side through the night
and withdraw at the peep of the day with stealthi tread
leav me basket coverd with white towel swell the hous with
their plenti
shall i postpon my accept and realiz and scream at my eye
that they turn from gaze after and down the road
and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent
exactli the valu of one and exactli the valu of two and which is ahead?

4
tripper and asker surround me
peopl i meet the effect upon me of my earli life or the ward and
citi i live in or the nation
the latest date discoveri invent societi author old and new
my dinner dress associ look compliment due
the real or fanci indiffer of some man or woman i love
the sick of one of my folk or of myself or ill-do or loss
or lack of money or depress or exalt
battl the horror of fratricid war the fever of doubt news
the fit events;
these come to me day and night and go from me again
but they are not the me myself

apart from the pull and haul stand what i am
stand amus complac compassion idl unitari
look down is erect or bend an arm on an impalp certain rest
look with side-curv head curiou what will come next
both in and out of the game and watch and wonder at it

backward i see in my own day where i sweat through fog with
linguist and contend
i have no mock or argument i wit and wait

5
i believ in you my soul the other i am must not abas itself to you
and you must not be abas to the other

loaf with me on the grass loos the stop from your throat
not word not music or rhyme i want not custom or lectur not
even the best
onli the lull i like the hum of your valv voic

i mind how onc we lay such a transpar summer morn
how you settl your head athwart my hip and gentli turnd over upon me
and part the shirt from my bosom-bon and plung your tongu
to my bare-stript heart
and reachd till you felt my beard and reachd till you held my feet

swiftli aros and spread around me the peac and knowledg that pass
all the argument of the earth
and i know that the hand of god is the promis of my own
and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own
and that all the men ever born are also my brother and the women
my sister and lover
and that a kelson of the creation is love
and limitless are leav stiff or droop in the field
and brown ant in the littl well beneath them
and mossi scab of the worm fenc heapd stone elder mullein and
poke-we

6
a child said what is the grass? fetch it to me with full hands;
how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is ani more than he

i guess it must be the flag of my disposit out of hope green
stuff woven

or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord
a scent gift and remembranc designedli dropt
bear the owner name someway in the corner that we may see
and remark and say whose?

or i guess the grass is itself a child the produc babe of the veget

or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyph
and it mean sprout alik in broad zone and narrow zone
grow among black folk as among white
kanuck tuckaho congressman cuff i give them the same i
receiv them the same

and now it seem to me the beauti uncut hair of grave

tenderli will i use you curl grass
it may be you transpir from the breast of young men
it may be if i had known them i would have love them
it may be you are from old peopl or from offspr taken soon out
of their mother lap
and here you are the mother lap

thi grass is veri dark to be from the white head of old mother
darker than the colorless beard of old men
dark to come from under the faint red roof of mouth

o i perceiv after all so mani utter tongu
and i perceiv they do not come from the roof of mouth for noth

i wish i could translat the hint about the dead young men and women
and the hint about old men and mother and the offspr taken
soon out of their lap

what do you think ha becom of the young and old men?
and what do you think ha becom of the women and children?

they are aliv and well somewher
the smallest sprout show there is realli no death
and if ever there wa it led forward life and doe not wait at the
end to arrest it
and ceasd the moment life appeard

all goe onward and outward noth collaps
and to die is differ from what ani one suppos and luckier

7
ha ani one suppos it lucki to be born?
i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucki to die and i know it

i pass death with the die and birth with the new-washd babe and
am not containd between my hat and boot
and perus manifold object no two alik and everi one good
the earth good and the star good and their adjunct all good

i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth
i am the mate and companion of peopl all just as immort and
fathomless as myself
(they do not know how immort but i know)

everi kind for itself and it own for me mine male and femal
for me those that have been boy and that love women
for me the man that is proud and feel how it sting to be slight
for me the sweet-heart and the old maid for me mother and the
mother of mother
for me lip that have smile eye that have shed tear
for me children and the begett of children

undrape! you are not guilti to me nor stale nor discard
i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no
and am around tenaci acquisit tireless and cannot be shaken away

8

clank of the shod hors on the granit floor
the snow-sleigh clink shout joke pelt of snow-bal

the flap of the curtaind litter a sick man insid born to the hospit
the meet of enemi the sudden oath the blow and fall
the excit crowd the policeman with hi star quickli work hi
passag to the centr of the crowd
the impass stone that receiv and return so mani echo
what groan of over-f or half-starvd who fall sunstruck or in fit
what exclam of women taken suddenli who hurri home and
give birth to babe
what live and buri speech is alway vibrat here what howl
restraind by decorum
arrest of crimin slight adulter offer made accept
reject with convex lip
i mind them or the show or reson of them--i come and i depart

9
the big door of the countri barn stand open and readi

the clear light play on the brown gray and green interting

i am there i help i came stretchd atop of the load
i felt it soft jolt one leg reclin on the other
i jump from the cross-beam and seiz the clover and timothi
and roll head over heel and tangl my hair full of wisp

10
alon far in the wild and mountain i hunt
wander amaz at my own light and glee
in the late afternoon choos a safe spot to pass the night
kindl a fire and broil the fresh-killd game
fall asleep on the gatherd leav with my dog and gun by my side

the yanke clipper is under her sky-sail she cut the sparkl and scud
my eye settl the land i bend at her prow or shout joyous from the deck

the boatmen and clam-digg aros earli and stopt for me
i tuckd my trowser-end in my boot and went and had a good time;
you should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettl

i saw the marriag of the trapper in the open air in the far west
the bride wa a red girl
her father and hi friend sat near cross-leg and dumbl smoke
they had moccasin to their feet and larg thick blanket
hang from their shoulder
on a bank loung the trapper he wa drest mostli in skin hi luxuri
beard and curl protect hi neck he held hi bride by the hand
she had long eyelash her head wa bare her coars straight lock
descend upon her voluptu limb and reachd to her feet

the runaway slave came to my hous and stopt outsid
i heard hi motion crackl the twig of the woodpil
through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsi and weak
and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assur him
and brought water and filld a tub for hi sweat bodi and bruisd feet
and gave him a room that enterd from my own and gave him some
coars clean cloth
and rememb perfectli well hi revolv eye and hi awkward
and rememb put piaster on the gall of hi neck and ankles;
he staid with me a week befor he wa recuper and passd north
i had him sit next me at tabl my fire-lock leand in the corner

11
twenty-eight young men bath by the shore
twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
twenty-eight year of womanli life and all so lonesom

she own the fine hous by the rise of the bank
she hide handsom and richli drest aft the blind of the window

which of the young men doe she like the best?
ah the homeliest of them is beauti to her

where are you off to lady? for i see you
you splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room

danc and laugh along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather
the rest did not see her but she saw them and love them

the beard of the young men glistend with wet it ran from their long hair
littl stream passd all over their bodi

an unseen hand also passd over their bodi
it descend tremblingli from their templ and rib

the young men float on their back their white belli bulg to the
sun they do not ask who seiz fast to them
they do not know who puff and declin with pendant and bend arch
they do not think whom they sous with spray

12
the butcher-boy put off hi killing-cloth or sharpen hi knife
at the stall in the market
i loiter enjoy hi reparte and hi shuffl and break-down

blacksmith with grime and hairi chest environ the anvil
each ha hi main-sledg they are all out there is a great heat in
the fire

from the cinder-strewd threshold i follow their movement

overhand the hammer swing overhand so slow overhand so sure
they do not hasten each man hit in hi place

13
the negro hold firmli the rein of hi four hors the block swag

i behold the picturesqu giant and love him and i do not stop there
i go with the team also

in me the caress of life wherev move backward as well as
forward slu
to nich asid and junior bend not a person or object miss
absorb all to myself and for thi song

oxen that rattl the yoke and chain or halt in the leafi shade what
is that you express in your eyes?
it seem to me more than all the print i have read in my life

my tread scare the wood-drak and wood-duck on my distant and
day-long rambl
they rise togeth they slowli circl around

i believ in those wingd purpos
and acknowledg red yellow white play within me
and consid green and violet and the tuft crown intent
and do not call the tortois unworthi becaus she is not someth els
and the in the wood never studi the gamut yet trill pretti well to me
and the look of the bay mare shame silli out of me

14
the wild gander lead hi flock through the cool night
ya-honk he say and sound it down to me like an invit
the pert may suppos it meaningless but i listen close
find it purpos and place up there toward the wintri sky

the sharp-hoofd moos of the north the cat on the house-sil the
chickade the prairie-dog
the litter of the grunt sow as they tug at her teat
the brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wing
i see in them and myself the same old law

the press of my foot to the earth spring a hundr affect
they scorn the best i can do to relat them

i am enamourd of grow out-door
of men that live among cattl or tast of the ocean or wood
of the builder and steerer of ship and the wielder of axe and
maul and the driver of hors
i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out

what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me
me go in for my chanc spend for vast return
adorn myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me
not ask the sky to come down to my good will
scatter it freeli forev

the ring of alarm-bel the cri of fire the whirr of swift-streak

i hear the violoncello (ti the young man heart complaint)
i hear the keyd cornet it glide quickli in through my ear

i hear the choru it is a grand opera

i hear the traind soprano (what work with her is this?)
the orchestra whirl me wider than uranu fli
it wrench such ardor from me i did not know i possessd them
it sail me i dab with bare feet they are lickd by the indol wave
i am cut by bitter and angri hail i lose my breath
steepd amid honeyd morphin my windpip throttl in fake of death

is thi then a touch? quiver me to a new ident
flame and ether make a rush for my vein

my flesh and blood play out lightn to strike what is hardli
differ from myself

strain the udder of my heart for it withheld drip
behav licenti toward me take no denial
depriv me of my best as for a purpos
unbutton my cloth hold me by the bare waist
delud my confus with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-field
immodestli slide the fellow-sens away
they bribe to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edg of me
no consider no regard for my drain strength or my anger
fetch the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while
then all unit to stand on a headland and worri me

the sentri desert everi other part of me
they have left me helpless to a red maraud
they all come to the headland to wit and assist against me

i am given up by traitor

all truth wait in all thing
they neither hasten their own deliveri nor resist it
they do not need the obstetr forcep of the surgeon
the insignific is as big to me as ani
(what is less or more than a touch?)

logic and sermon never convinc
the damp of the night drive deeper into my soul

(onli what prove itself to everi man and woman is so
onli what nobodi deni is so)

a minut and a drop of me settl my brain
i believ the soggi clod shall becom lover and lamp
and a compend of compend is the meat of a man or woman
and a summit and flower there is the feel they have for each other
and they are to branch boundlessli out of that lesson until it
becom omnif
and until one and all shall delight us and we them

31
i believ a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the star
and the pismir is equal perfect and a grain of sand and the egg
of the wren
and the tree-toad is a chef-doeuvr for the highest
and the run blackberri would adorn the parlor of heaven
and the narrowest hing in my hand put to scorn all machineri
and the cow crunch with depressd head surpass ani statu
and a mous is miracl enough to stagger sextillion of infidel

i find i incorpor gneiss coal long-thread moss fruit

and am stuccod with quadrup and bird all over
and have distanc what is behind me for good reason
but call ani thing back again when i desir it

in vain the speed or shyness
in vain the pluton rock send their old heat against my approach
in vain the mastodon retreat beneath it own powderd bone
in vain object stand leagu off and assum manifold shape
in vain the ocean settl in hollow and the great monster lie low
in vain the buzzard hous herself with the sky
in vain the snake slide through the creeper and log
in vain the elk take to the inner pass of the wood
in vain the razor-billd auk sail far north to labrador
i follow quickli i ascend to the nest in the fissur of the cliff

32
i think i could turn and live with anim they are so placid and
self-containd
i stand and look at them long and long

they do not sweat and whine about their condit
they do not lie awak in the dark and weep for their sin
they do not make me sick discuss their duti to god
not one is dissatisfi not one is dement with the mania of
own thing
not one kneel to anoth nor to hi kind that live thousand of
year ago
not one is respect or unhappi over the whole earth

so they show their relat to me and i accept them
they bring me token of myself they evinc them plainli in their
possess

i wonder where they get those token
did i pass that way huge time ago and neglig drop them?

myself move forward then and now and forev
gather and show more alway and with veloc
infinit and omnigen and the like of these among them
not too exclus toward the reacher of my remembranc
pick out here one that i love and now go with him on brotherli term

a gigant beauti of a stallion fresh and respons to my caress
head high in the forehead wide between the ear
limb glossi and suppl tail dust the ground
eye full of sparkl wicked ear fine cut flexibl move

hi nostril dilat as my heel embrac him
hi well-built limb trembl with pleasur as we race around and return

i but use you a minut then i resign you stallion
whi do i need your pace when i myself out-gallop them?
even as i stand or sit pass faster than you

33

how he knuckl tight and gave not back an inch and wa faith of
day and faith of night
and chalkd in larg letter on a board be of good cheer we will
not desert you;
how he followd with them and tackd with them three day and
would not give it up
how he save the drift compani at last
how the lank loose-gownd women lookd when boat from the

how the silent old-fac infant and the lift sick and the
sharp-lippd unshav men;
all thi i swallow it tast good i like it well it becom mine
i am the man i sufferd i wa there

the disdain and calm of martyr
the mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dri wood her

blow coverd with sweat
the twing that sting like needl hi leg and neck the murder
buckshot and the bullet
all these i feel or am

i am the hound slave i winc at the bite of the dog
hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen
i clutch the rail of the fenc my gore drib thinnd with the

i fall on the weed and stone
the rider spur their unwil hors haul close
taunt my dizzi ear and beat me violent over the head with whip-stock

agoni are one of my chang of garment
i do not ask the wound person how he feel i myself becom the
wound person
my hurt turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observ

i am the mashd fireman with breast-bon broken
tumbl wall buri me in their debri
heat and smoke i inspir i heard the yell shout of my comrad
i heard the distant click of their pick and shovel
they have cleard the beam away they tenderli lift me forth

i lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervad hush is for my sake
painless after all i lie exhaust but not so unhappi
white and beauti are the face around me the head are bare
of their fire-cap
the kneel crowd fade with the light of the torch

distant and dead resuscit
they show as the dial or move as the hand of me i am the clock myself

i am an old artillerist i tell of my fort bombard
i am there again

again the long roll of the drummer
again the attack cannon mortar
again to my listen ear the cannon respons

i take part i see and hear the whole
the cri curs roar the plaudit for well-aimd shot
the ambulanza slowli pass trail it red drip

now i tell what i knew in texa in my earli youth
(i tell not the fall of alamo
not one escap to tell the fall of alamo
the hundr and fifti are dumb yet at alamo)
ti the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundr and twelv
young men

retreat they had formd in a hollow squar with their baggag for
breastwork
nine hundr live out of the surround enemi nine time their
number wa the price they took in advanc
their colonel wa wound and their ammunit gone
they treat for an honor capitul receivd write and
seal gave up their arm and marchd back prison of war

they were the glori of the race of ranger
matchless with hors rifl song supper courtship
larg turbul gener handsom proud and affection
beard sunburnt drest in the free costum of hunter
not a singl one over thirti year of age

the second first-day morn they were brought out in squad and
massacr it wa beauti earli summer
the work commenc about five oclock and wa over by eight

none obeyd the command to kneel
some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight
a few fell at onc shot in the templ or heart the live and dead
lay togeth
the maimd and mangl dug in the dirt the new-com saw them there
some half-killd attempt to crawl away
these were despatchd with bayonet or batterd with the blunt of musket
a youth not seventeen year old seizd hi assassin till two more
came to releas him
the three were all torn and coverd with the boy blood

at eleven oclock began the burn of the bodies;
that is the tale of the murder of the four hundr and twelv young men

35
would you hear of an old-tim sea-fight?
would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
list to the yarn as my grandmoth father the sailor told it to me

our foe wa no sulk in hi ship i tell you (said he)
hi wa the surli english pluck and there is no tougher or truer
and never wa and never will be;
along the lowerd eve he came horribl rake us

we close with him the yard entangl the cannon touchd
my captain lashd fast with hi own hand

we had receivd some eighteen pound shot under the water
on our lower-gun-deck two larg piec had burst at the first fire
kill all around and blow up overhead

fight at sun-down fight at dark
ten oclock at night the full moon well up our leak on the gain

the transit to and from the magazin is now stopt by the sentinel
they see so mani strang face they do not know whom to trust

our frigat take fire
the other ask if we demand quarter?
if our color are struck and the fight done?

now i laugh content for i hear the voic of my littl captain
we have not struck he composedli cri we have just begun our part
of the fight

one of the pump ha been shot away it is gener thought we are sink

seren stand the littl captain
he is not hurri hi voic is neither high nor low
hi eye give more light to us than our battle-lantern

toward twelv there in the beam of the moon they surrend to us

36
stretchd and still lie the midnight
two great hull motionless on the breast of the dark
our vessel riddl and slowli sink prepar to pass to the
one we have conquerd
the captain on the quarter-deck coldli give hi order through a
counten white as a sheet
near by the corps of the child that servd in the cabin
the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and care
curld whisker
the flame spite of all that can be done flicker aloft and below
the huski voic of the two or three offic yet fit for duti
formless stack of bodi and bodi by themselv dab of flesh

cut of cordag dangl of rig slight shock of the sooth of wave
black and impass gun litter of powder-parcel strong scent
a few larg star overhead silent and mourn shine

old age superbl rising! o welcom ineff grace of die days!

everi condit promulg not onli itself it promulg what grow
after and out of itself

there is no stoppag and never can be stoppag
if i you and the world and all beneath or upon their surfac

not avail the long run
we should sure bring up again where we now stand
and sure go as much farther and then farther and farther

a few quadrillion of era a few octillion of cubic leagu do
not hazard the span or make it impati
they are but part ani thing is but a part

see ever so far there is limitless space outsid of that
count ever so much there is limitless time around that

my rendezv is appoint it is certain
the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect term
the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there

46
i know i have the best of time and space and wa never measur and
never will be measur

i tramp a perpetu journey (come listen all!)
my sign are a rain-proof coat good shoe and a staff cut from the wood
no friend of mine take hi eas in my chair
i have no chair no church no philosophi
i lead no man to a dinner-t librari exchang
but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll
my left hand hook you round the waist
my right hand point to landscap of contin and the public road

not i not ani one els can travel that road for you
you must travel it for yourself

it is not far it is within reach
perhap you have been on it sinc you were born and did not know
perhap it is everywher on water and on land

shoulder your dud dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth
wonder citi and free nation we shall fetch as we go

if you tire give me both burden and rest the chuff of your hand
on my hip
and in due time you shall repay the same servic to me
for after we start we never lie by again

thi day befor dawn i ascend a hill and lookd at the crowd heaven
and i said to my spirit when we becom the enfold of those orb
and the pleasur and knowledg of everi thing in them shall we
be filld and satisfi then?
and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continu beyond

you are also ask me question and i hear you
i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself

sit a while dear son
here are biscuit to eat and here is milk to drink
but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet cloth i kiss you
with a good-bi kiss and open the gate for your egress henc

long enough have you dreamd contempt dream
now i wash the gum from your eye
you must habit yourself to the dazzl of the light and of everi
moment of your life

long have you timidli wade hold a plank by the shore
now i will you to be a bold swimmer
to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout
and laughingli dash with your hair

47
i am the teacher of athlet
he that by me spread a wider breast than my own prove the width of my own
he most honor my style who learn under it to destroy the teacher

the boy i love the same becom a man not through deriv power
but in hi own right
wick rather than virtuou out of conform or fear
fond of hi sweetheart relish well hi steak
unrequit love or a slight cut him wors than sharp steel cut
first-rat to ride to fight to hit the bull eye to sail a
skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo
prefer scar and the beard and face pit with small-pox over
all lather
and those well-tannd to those that keep out of the sun

i teach stray from me yet who can stray from me?
i follow you whoever you are from the present hour
my word itch at your ear till you understand them

i do not say these thing for a dollar or to fill up the time while
i wait for a boat
(it is you talk just as much as myself i act as the tongu of you
tie in your mouth in mine it begin to be loosend)

i swear i will never again mention love or death insid a hous
and i swear i will never translat myself at all onli to him or her
who privat stay with me in the open air

if you would understand me go to the height or water-shor
the nearest gnat is an explan and a drop or motion of wave key
the maul the oar the hand-saw second my word

no shutterd room or school can commun with me
but rough and littl children better than they

the young mechan is closest to me he know me well
the woodman that take hi axe and jug with him shall take me with
him all day
the farm-boy plough in the field feel good at the sound of my voic
in vessel that sail my word sail i go with fishermen and seamen
and love them

the soldier campd or upon the march is mine
on the night ere the pend battl mani seek me and i do not fail them
on that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me
my face rub to the hunter face when he lie down alon in hi blanket
the driver think of me doe not mind the jolt of hi wagon
the young mother and old mother comprehend me
the girl and the wife rest the needl a moment and forget where they are
they and all would resum what i have told them

48
i have said that the soul is not more than the bodi
and i have said that the bodi is not more than the soul
and noth not god is greater to one than one self is
and whoever walk a furlong without sympathi walk to hi own
funer drest in hi shroud
and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchas the pick of the earth
and to glanc with an eye or show a bean in it pod confound the
learn of all time
and there is no trade or employ but the young man follow it
may becom a hero
and there is no object so soft but it make a hub for the wheeld univers
and i say to ani man or woman let your soul stand cool and compos
befor a million univers

and i say to mankind be not curiou about god
for i who am curiou about each am not curiou about god
(no array of term can say how much i am at peac about god and
about death)

i hear and behold god in everi object yet understand god not in the least
nor do i understand who there can be more wonder than myself

whi should i wish to see god better than thi day?
i see someth of god each hour of the twenty-four and each moment then
in the face of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass
i find letter from god dropt in the street and everi one is signd
by god name
and i leav them where they are for i know that whereso i go
other will punctual come for ever and ever

49
and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortal it is idl to
tri to alarm me

to hi work without flinch the accoucheur come
i see the elder-hand press receiv support
i reclin by the sill of the exquisit flexibl door
and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escap

and as to you corps i think you are good manur but that doe not
offend me
i smell the white rose sweet-scent and grow
i reach to the leafi lip i reach to the polishd breast of melon

and as to you life i reckon you are the leav of mani death
(no doubt i have die myself ten thousand time before)

i hear you whisper there o star of heaven
o suns--o grass of graves--o perpetu transfer and promot
if you do not say ani thing how can i say ani thing?

of the turbid pool that lie in the autumn forest
of the moon that descend the steep of the sough twilight
toss sparkl of day and dusk--toss on the black stem that decay
in the muck
toss to the moan gibberish of the dri limb

i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night
i perceiv that the ghastli glimmer is noonday sunbeam reflect
and debouch to the steadi and central from the offspr great or small

50
there is that in me--i do not know what it is--but i know it is in me

wrenchd and sweaty--calm and cool then my bodi becom
i sleep--i sleep long

i do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid
it is not in ani dictionari utter symbol

someth it swing on more than the earth i swing on
to it the creation is the friend whose embrac awak me

perhap i might tell more outlines! i plead for my brother and sister

do you see o my brother and sisters?
it is not chao or death--it is form union plan--it is etern
life--it is happi

51
the past and present wilt--i have filld them empti them
and proceed to fill my next fold of the futur

listen up there! what have you to confid to me?
look in my face while i snuff the sidl of even
(talk honestli no one els hear you and i stay onli a minut longer)

do i contradict myself?
veri well then i contradict myself
(i am larg i contain multitudes)

i concentr toward them that are nigh i wait on the door-slab

who ha done hi day work? who will soonest be through with hi supper?
who wish to walk with me?

will you speak befor i am gone? will you prove alreadi too late?

52
the spot hawk swoop by and accus me he complain of my gab
and my loiter

i too am not a bit tame i too am untranslat
i sound my barbar yawp over the roof of the world

the last scud of day hold back for me
it fling my like after the rest and true as ani on the shadowd wild
it coax me to the vapor and the dusk

i depart as air i shake my white lock at the runaway sun
i effus my flesh in eddi and drift it in laci jag

i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love
if you want me again look for me under your boot-sol

you will hardli know who i am or what i mean
but i shall be good health to you nevertheless
and filter and fibr your blood

fail to fetch me at first keep encourag
miss me one place search anoth
i stop somewher wait for you

1
i sing the bodi electr
the armi of those i love engirth me and i engirth them
they will not let me off till i go with them respond to them
and discorrupt them and charg them full with the charg of the soul

wa it doubt that those who corrupt their own bodi conceal themselves?
and if those who defil the live are as bad as they who defil the dead?
and if the bodi doe not do fulli as much as the soul?
and if the bodi were not the soul what is the soul?

2
the love of the bodi of man or woman balk account the bodi itself
balk account
that of the male is perfect and that of the femal is perfect

the express of the face balk account

hi hip and wrist
it is in hi walk the carriag of hi neck the flex of hi waist

to see him pass convey as much as the best poem perhap more
you linger to see hi back and the back of hi neck and shoulder-sid

i knew a man a common farmer the father of five son
and in them the father of son and in them the father of son

thi man wa a wonder vigor calm beauti of person
the shape of hi head the pale yellow and white of hi hair and
beard the immeasur mean of hi black eye the rich
and breadth of hi manner
these i use to go and visit him to see he wa wise also
he wa six feet tall he wa over eighti year old hi son were
massiv clean beard tan-fac handsom
they and hi daughter love him all who saw him love him
they did not love him by allow they love him with person love
he drank water onli the blood showd like scarlet through the
clear-brown skin of hi face
he wa a frequent gunner and fisher he saild hi boat himself he
had a fine one present to him by a ship-join he had
fowling-piec present to him by men that love him
when he went with hi five son and mani grand-son to hunt or fish
you would pick him out as the most beauti and vigor of the gang
you would wish long and long to be with him you would wish to sit
by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other

4
i have perceivd that to be with those i like is enough
to stop in compani with the rest at even is enough
to be surround by beauti curiou breath laugh flesh is enough
to pass among them or touch ani one or rest my arm ever so lightli
round hi or her neck for a moment what is thi then?
i do not ask ani more delight i swim in it as in a sea

there is someth in stay close to men and women and look
on them and in the contact and odor of them that pleas the soul well
all thing pleas the soul but these pleas the soul well

5

(still here i carri my old delici burden
i carri them men and women i carri them with me wherev i go
i swear it is imposs for me to get rid of them
i am filld with them and i will fill them in return)

2
you road i enter upon and look around i believ you are not all
that is here
i believ that much unseen is also here

here the profound lesson of recept nor prefer nor denial
the black with hi woolli head the felon the diseasd the
illiter person are not denied;
the birth the hast after the physician the beggar tramp the
drunkard stagger the laugh parti of mechan
the escap youth the rich person carriag the fop the elop coupl
the earli market-man the hears the move of furnitur into the
town the return back from the town
they pass i also pass ani thing pass none can be interdict
none but are accept none but shall be dear to me

3
you air that serv me with breath to speak!
you object that call from diffus my mean and give them shape!
you light that wrap me and all thing in delic equabl showers!
you path worn in the irregular hollow by the roadsides!
i believ you are latent with unseen exist you are so dear to me

you flaggd walk of the cities! you strong curb at the edges!
you ferries! you plank and post of wharves! you timber-lin
side! you distant ships!
you row of houses! you window-piercd facades! you roofs!
you porch and entrances! you cope and iron guards!
you window whose transpar shell might expos so much!
you door and ascend steps! you arches!
you gray stone of intermin pavements! you trodden crossings!
from all that ha touchd you i believ you have impart to
yourselv and now would impart the same secretli to me
from the live and the dead you have peopl your impass surfac
and the spirit thereof would be evid and amic with me

4
the earth expand right hand and left hand
the pictur aliv everi part in it best light
the music fall in where it is want and stop where it is
not want
the cheer voic of the public road the gay fresh sentiment of the road

o highway i travel do you say to me do not leav me?
do you say ventur not--if you leav me you are lost?
do you say i am alreadi prepar i am well-beaten and undeni
adher to me?

o public road i say back i am not afraid to leav you yet i love you
you express me better than i can express myself
you shall be more to me than my poem

i think heroic deed were all conceivd in the open air and all
free poem also
i think i could stop here myself and do miracl
i think whatev i shall meet on the road i shall like and whoever
behold me shall like me
i think whoever i see must be happi

5
from thi hour i ordain myself loosd of limit and imaginari line
go where i list my own master total and absolut
listen to other consid well what they say
paus search receiv contempl
gentli but with undeni will divest myself of the hold that
would hold me

i inhal great draught of space
the east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine

i am larger better than i thought
i did not know i held so much good

all seem beauti to me
can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me
i would do the same to you
i will recruit for myself and you as i go
i will scatter myself among men and women as i go
i will toss a new glad and rough among them
whoever deni me it shall not troubl me
whoever accept me he or she shall be bless and shall bless me

6
now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaz me
now if a thousand beauti form of women appeard it would not
astonish me

now i see the secret of the make of the best person
it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth

here a great person deed ha room
(such a deed seiz upon the heart of the whole race of men
it effus of strength and will overwhelm law and mock all
author and all argument against it)

here is the test of wisdom
wisdom is not final test in school
wisdom cannot be passd from one have it to anoth not have it
wisdom is of the soul is not suscept of proof is it own proof
appli to all stage and object and qualiti and is content
is the certainti of the realiti and immort of thing and the
excel of things;
someth there is in the float of the sight of thing that provok
it out of the soul

now i re-examin philosophi and religion
they may prove well in lecture-room yet not prove at all under the
spaciou cloud and along the landscap and flow current

here is realiz
here is a man tallied--h realiz here what he ha in him
the past the futur majesti love--if they are vacant of you you
are vacant of them

onli the kernel of everi object nourishes;
where is he who tear off the husk for you and me?
where is he that undo stratagem and envelop for you and me?

here is adhes it is not previous fashiond it is apropos;
do you know what it is as you pass to be love by strangers?
do you know the talk of those turn eye-balls?

7
here is the efflux of the soul
the efflux of the soul come from within through embowerd gate
ever provok question
these yearn whi are they? these thought in the dark whi are they?
whi are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight
expand my blood?
whi when they leav me do my pennant of joy sink flat and lank?
whi are there tree i never walk under but larg and melodi
thought descend upon me?
(i think they hang there winter and summer on those tree and alway
drop fruit as i pass;)
what is it i interchang so suddenli with strangers?
what with some driver as i ride on the seat by hi side?
what with some fisherman draw hi sein by the shore as i walk by
and pause?
what give me to be free to a woman and man good-will? what
give them to be free to mine?

8
the efflux of the soul is happi here is happi
i think it pervad the open air wait at all time
now it flow unto us we are rightli charg

here rise the fluid and attach charact
the fluid and attach charact is the fresh and sweet of
man and woman
(the herb of the morn sprout no fresher and sweeter everi day
out of the root of themselv than it sprout fresh and sweet
continu out of itself)

toward the fluid and attach charact exud the sweat of the
love of young and old
from it fall distilld the charm that mock beauti and attain
toward it heav the shudder long ach of contact

cloud of the west--sun there half an hour high--i see you also face
to face

crowd of men and women attir in the usual costum how curiou
you are to me!
on the ferry-boat the hundr and hundr that cross return
home are more curiou to me than you suppos
and you that shall cross from shore to shore year henc are more
to me and more in my medit than you might suppos

2
the impalp susten of me from all thing at all hour of the day
the simpl compact well-joind scheme myself disintegr everi
one disintegr yet part of the scheme
the similitud of the past and those of the futur
the glori strung like bead on my smallest sight and hear on
the walk in the street and the passag over the river
the current rush so swiftli and swim with me far away
the other that are to follow me the tie between me and them
the certainti of other the life love sight hear of other

other will enter the gate of the ferri and cross from shore to shore
other will watch the run of the flood-tid
other will see the ship of manhattan north and west and the
height of brooklyn to the south and east
other will see the island larg and small;
fifti year henc other will see them as they cross the sun half
an hour high
a hundr year henc or ever so mani hundr year henc other
will see them
will enjoy the sunset the pouring-in of the flood-tid the
falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tid

3
it avail not time nor place--dist avail not
i am with you you men and women of a gener or ever so mani
gener henc
just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so i felt
just as ani of you is one of a live crowd i wa one of a crowd
just as you are refreshd by the glad of the river and the
bright flow i wa refreshd
just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurri with the swift
current i stood yet wa hurri
just as you look on the numberless mast of ship and the
thick-stemmd pipe of steamboat i lookd

i too mani and mani a time crossd the river of old
watch the twelfth-month sea-gul saw them high in the air
float with motionless wing oscil their bodi
saw how the glisten yellow lit up part of their bodi and left
the rest in strong shadow
saw the slow-wheel circl and the gradual edg toward the south
saw the reflect of the summer sky in the water
had my eye dazzl by the shimmer track of beam
lookd at the fine centrifug spoke of light round the shape of my
head in the sunlit water
lookd on the haze on the hill southward and south-westward
lookd on the vapor as it flew in fleec ting with violet
lookd toward the lower bay to notic the vessel arriv
saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me
saw the white sail of schooner and sloop saw the ship at anchor
the sailor at work in the rig or out astrid the spar
the round mast the swing motion of the hull the slender
serpentin pennant
the larg and small steamer in motion the pilot in their pilothous
the white wake left by the passag the quick tremul whirl of the wheel
the flag of all nation the fall of them at sunset
the scallop-edg wave in the twilight the ladl cup the
frolic-som crest and glisten
the stretch afar grow dimmer and dimmer the gray wall of the
granit storehous by the dock
on the river the shadowi group the big steam-tug close flankd on
each side by the barg the hay-boat the belat lighter
on the neighbor shore the fire from the foundri chimney burn
high and glaringli into the night
cast their flicker of black contrast with wild red and yellow
light over the top of hous and down into the cleft of street

4
these and all els were to me the same as they are to you
i love well those citi love well the state and rapid river
the men and women i saw were all near to me
other the same--oth who look back on me becaus i lookd forward
to them
(the time will come though i stop here to-day and to-night)

5
what is it then between us?
what is the count of the score or hundr of year between us?

whatev it is it avail not--dist avail not and place avail not
i too live brooklyn of ampl hill wa mine
i too walkd the street of manhattan island and bath in the
water around it
i too felt the curiou abrupt question stir within me
in the day among crowd of peopl sometim they came upon me
in my walk home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me
i too had been struck from the float forev held in solut
i too had receivd ident by my bodi
that i wa i knew wa of my bodi and what i should be i knew i
should be of my bodi

6
it is not upon you alon the dark patch fall
the dark threw it patch down upon me also
the best i had done seemd to me blank and suspici
my great thought as i suppos them were they not in realiti meagre?
nor is it you alon who know what it is to be evil
i am he who knew what it wa to be evil
i too knit the old knot of contrarieti
blabbd blushd resent lie stole grudgd
had guil anger lust hot wish i dare not speak
wa wayward vain greedi shallow sli cowardli malign
the wolf the snake the hog not want in me
the cheat look the frivol word the adulter wish not want

refus hate postpon mean lazi none of these want
wa one with the rest the day and hap of the rest
wa calld by my nighest name by clear loud voic of young men as
they saw me approach or pass
felt their arm on my neck as i stood or the neglig lean of
their flesh against me as i sat
saw mani i love in the street or ferry-boat or public assembl yet
never told them a word
live the same life with the rest the same old laugh gnaw sleep
playd the part that still look back on the actor or actress
the same old role the role that is what we make it as great as we like
or as small as we like or both great and small

7
closer yet i approach you
what thought you have of me now i had as much of you--i laid in my
store in advanc
i considerd long and serious of you befor you were born

who wa to know what should come home to me?
who know but i am enjoy this?
who know for all the distanc but i am as good as look at you
now for all you cannot see me?

8
ah what can ever be more state and admir to me than
mast-hemmd manhattan?
river and sunset and scallop-edgd wave of flood-tide?
the sea-gul oscil their bodi the hay-boat in the
twilight and the belat lighter?
what god can exceed these that clasp me by the hand and with voic i
love call me promptli and loudli by my nighest name as approach?
what is more subtl than thi which tie me to the woman or man that
look in my face?
which fuse me into you now and pour my mean into you?

we understand then do we not?
what i promisd without mention it have you not accepted?
what the studi could not teach--what the preach could not
accomplish is accomplishd is it not?

9
flow on river! flow with the flood-tid and ebb with the ebb-tide!
frolic on crest and scallop-edgd waves!
gorgeou cloud of the sunset! drench with your splendor me or the

(ah littl reck the labor
how near hi work is hold him to god
the love labor through space and time)

after all not to creat onli or found onli
but to bring perhap from afar what is alreadi found
to give it our own ident averag limitless free
to fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religi fire
not to repel or destroy so much as accept fuse rehabilit
to obey as well as command to follow more than to lead
these also are the lesson of our new world;
while how littl the new after all how much the old old world!

long and long ha the grass been grow
long and long ha the rain been fall
long ha the globe been roll round

come muse migrat from greec and ionia
cross out pleas those immens overpaid account

} song of the redwood-tre

1
a california song
a propheci and indirect a thought impalp to breath as air
a choru of dryad fade depart or hamadryad depart
a murmur fate giant voic out of the earth and sky
voic of a mighti die tree in the redwood forest dens

farewel my brethren
farewel o earth and sky farewel ye neighbor water
my time ha end my term ha come

along the northern coast
just back from the rock-bound shore and the cave
in the salin air from the sea in the mendocino countri
with the surg for base and accompani low and hoars
with crackl blow of axe sound music driven by strong arm
riven deep by the sharp tongu of the axe there in the redwood
forest dens
i heard the might tree it death-chant chant

the chopper heard not the camp shanti echo not
the quick-eard teamster and chain and jack-screw men heard not
as the wood-spirit came from their haunt of a thousand year to
join the refrain
but in my soul i plainli heard

murmur out of it myriad leav
down from it lofti top rise two hundr feet high
out of it stalwart trunk and limb out of it foot-thick bark
that chant of the season and time chant not of the past onli but
the futur

you untold life of me
and all you vener and innoc joy
perenni hardi life of me with joy mid rain and mani a summer sun
and the white snow and night and the wild winds;
o the great patient rug joy my soul strong joy unreckd by man
(for know i bear the soul befit me i too have conscious ident
and all the rock and mountain have and all the earth)
joy of the life befit me and brother mine
our time our term ha come

for them we abdic in them ourselv ye forest king
in them these sky and air these mountain peak shasta nevada
these huge precipit cliff thi amplitud these valley far yosemit
to be in them absorbd assimil

then to a loftier strain
still prouder more ecstat rose the chant
as if the heir the deiti of the west
join with master-tongu bore part

not wan from asia fetich
nor red from europ old dynast slaughter-hous
(area of murder-plot of throne with scent left yet of war and

} a song for occup

1
a song for occupations!
in the labor of engin and trade and the labor of field i find
the develop
and find the etern mean

workmen and workwomen!
were all educ practic and ornament well displayd out of
me what would it amount to?
were i as the head teacher charit proprietor wise statesman
what would it amount to?
were i to you as the boss employ and pay you would that satisfi you?

the learnd virtuou benevol and the usual term
a man like me and never the usual term

neither a servant nor a master i
i take no sooner a larg price than a small price i will have my
own whoever enjoy me
i will be even with you and you shall be even with me

if you stand at work in a shop i stand as nigh as the nighest in the
same shop
if you bestow gift on your brother or dearest friend i demand as
good as your brother or dearest friend
if your lover husband wife is welcom by day or night i must be
person as welcom
if you becom degrad crimin ill then i becom so for your sake
if you rememb your foolish and outlawd deed do you think i
cannot rememb my own foolish and outlawd deeds?
if you carous at the tabl i carous at the opposit side of the tabl
if you meet some stranger in the street and love him or her whi
i often meet stranger in the street and love them

whi what have you thought of yourself?
is it you then that thought yourself less?
is it you that thought the presid greater than you?
or the rich better off than you? or the educ wiser than you?

(becaus you are greasi or pimpl or were onc drunk or a thief
or that you are diseasd or rheumat or a prostitut
or from frivol or impot or that you are no scholar and never
saw your name in print
do you give in that you are ani less immortal?)

2
soul of men and women! it is not you i call unseen unheard
untouch and untouch
it is not you i go argu pro and con about and to settl whether
you are aliv or no
i own publicli who you are if nobodi els own

grown half-grown and babe of thi countri and everi countri
in-door and out-door one just as much as the other i see
and all els behind or through them

the wife and she is not one jot less than the husband
the daughter and she is just as good as the son
the mother and she is everi bit as much as the father

offspr of ignor and poor boy apprent to trade
young fellow work on farm and old fellow work on farm
sailor-men merchant-men coaster immigr
all these i see but nigher and farther the same i see
none shall escap me and none shall wish to escap me

i bring what you much need yet alway have
not money amour dress eat erudit but as good
i send no agent or medium offer no repres of valu but
offer the valu itself

there is someth that come to one now and perpetu
it is not what is print preachd discuss it elud discuss
and print
it is not to be put in a book it is not in thi book
it is for you whoever you are it is no farther from you than your
hear and sight are from you
it is hint by nearest commonest readiest it is ever provok by them

you may read in mani languag yet read noth about it
you may read the presid messag and read noth about it there
noth in the report from the state depart or treasuri
depart or in the daili paper or weekli paper
or in the censu or revenu return price current or ani account
of stock

3
the sun and star that float in the open air
the apple-shap earth and we upon it sure the drift of them is
someth grand
i do not know what it is except that it is grand and that it is happi
and that the enclos purport of us here is not a specul or
bon-mot or reconnoiss
and that it is not someth which by luck may turn out well for us
and without luck must be a failur for us
and not someth which may yet be retract in a certain conting

the light and shade the curiou sens of bodi and ident the
greed that with perfect complais devour all thing
the endless pride and outstretch of man unspeak joy and sorrow
the wonder everi one see in everi one els he see and the wonder
that fill each minut of time forev
what have you reckond them for camerado?
have you reckond them for your trade or farm-work? or for the
profit of your store?
or to achiev yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman leisur
or a ladi leisure?

have you reckond that the landscap took substanc and form that it
might be paint in a picture?
or men and women that they might be written of and song sung?
or the attract of graviti and the great law and harmoni combin
and the fluid of the air as subject for the savans?
or the brown land and the blue sea for map and charts?
or the star to be put in constel and name fanci names?
or that the growth of seed is for agricultur tabl or
agricultur itself?

old institut these art librari legend collect and
the practic hand along in manufactur will we rate them so high?
will we rate our cash and busi high? i have no object
i rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and
man i rate beyond all rate

we thought our union grand and our constitut grand
i do not say they are not grand and good for they are
i am thi day just as much in love with them as you
then i am in love with you and with all my fellow upon the earth

we consid bibl and religion divine--i do not say they are not divin
i say they have all grown out of you and may grow out of you still
it is not they who give the life it is you who give the life
leav are not more shed from the tree or tree from the earth
than they are shed out of you

4
the sum of all known rever i add up in you whoever you are
the presid is there in the white hous for you it is not you who
are here for him
the secretari act in their bureau for you not you here for them
the congress conven everi twelfth-month for you
law court the form of state the charter of citi the
go and come of commerc and mall are all for you

list close my scholar dear
doctrin polit and civil exurg from you
sculptur and monument and ani thing inscrib anywher are talli in you
the gist of histori and statist as far back as the record
reach is in you thi hour and myth and tale the same
if you were not breath and walk here where would they all be?
the most renownd poem would be ash orat and play would
be vacuum

all architectur is what you do to it when you look upon it
(did you think it wa in the white or gray stone? or the line of
the arch and cornices?)

all music is what awak from you when you are remind by the instrument
it is not the violin and the cornet it is not the obo nor the
beat drum nor the score of the bariton singer sing hi
sweet romanza nor that of the men choru nor that of the
women choru
it is nearer and farther than they

5
will the whole come back then?
can each see sign of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is
there noth greater or more?
doe all sit there with you with the mystic unseen soul?

strang and hard that paradox true i give

} a song of the roll earth

1
a song of the roll earth and of word accord
were you think that those were the word those upright lines?
those curv angl dots?
no those are not the word the substanti word are in the ground
and sea
they are in the air they are in you

were you think that those were the word those delici sound
out of your friend mouths?
no the real word are more delici than they

human bodi are word myriad of word
(in the best poem re-appear the bodi man or woman
well-shap natur gay
everi part abl activ recept without shame or the need of shame)

air soil water fire--thos are word
i myself am a word with them--mi qualiti interpenetr with
theirs--mi name is noth to them
though it were told in the three thousand languag what would
air soil water fire know of my name?

a healthi presenc a friendli or command gestur are word
say mean
the charm that go with the mere look of some men and women
are say and mean also

the workmanship of soul is by those inaud word of the earth
the master know the earth word and use them more than audibl word

amelior is one of the earth word
the earth neither lag nor hasten
it ha all attribut growth effect latent in itself from the jump
it is not half beauti onli defect and excresc show just as
much as perfect show

the earth doe not withhold it is gener enough
the truth of the earth continu wait they are not so conceald either
they are calm subtl untransmiss by print
they are imbu through all thing convey themselv willingli
convey a sentiment and invit i utter and utter
i speak not yet if you hear me not of what avail am i to you?
to bear to better lack these of what avail am i?

(accouche! accouchez!
will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
will you squat and stifl there?)

the earth doe not argu
is not pathet ha no arrang
doe not scream hast persuad threaten promis
make no discrimin ha no conceiv failur
close noth refus noth shut none out
of all the power object state it notifi shut none out

the earth doe not exhibit itself nor refus to exhibit itself
possess still underneath
underneath the ostens sound the august choru of hero the
wail of slave
persuas of lover curs gasp of the die laughter of young
peopl accent of bargain
underneath these possess word that never fall

to her children the word of the eloqu dumb great mother never fail
the true word do not fail for motion doe not fail and reflect
doe not fall
also the day and night do not fall and the voyag we pursu doe not fall

of the intermin sister
of the ceaseless cotillon of sister
of the centripet and centrifug sister the elder and younger sister
the beauti sister we know danc on with the rest

with her ampl back toward everi behold
with the fascin of youth and the equal fascin of age
sit she whom i too love like the rest sit undisturbd
hold up in her hand what ha the charact of a mirror while her
eye glanc back from it
glanc as she sit invit none deni none
hold a mirror day and night tirelessli befor her own face

seen at hand or seen at a distanc
duli the twenty-four appear in public everi day
duli approach and pass with their companion or a companion
look from no counten of their own but from the counten
of those who are with them
from the counten of children or women or the manli counten
from the open counten of anim or from inanim thing
from the landscap or water or from the exquisit apparit of the sky
from our counten mine and your faith return them
everi day in public appear without fall but never twice with the
same companion

embrac man embrac all proceed the three hundr and
sixty-f resistlessli round the sun;
embrac all sooth support follow close three hundr and
sixty-f offset of the first sure and necessari as they

tumbl on steadili noth dread
sunshin storm cold heat forev withstand pass carri
the soul realiz and determin still inherit
the fluid vacuum around and ahead still enter and divid
no balk retard no anchor anchor on no rock strike
swift glad content unbereavd noth lose
of all abl and readi at ani time to give strict account
the divin ship sail the divin sea

2
whoever you are! motion and reflect are especi for you
the divin ship sail the divin sea for you

whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid
you are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky
for none more than you are the present and the past
for none more than you is immort

each man to himself and each woman to herself is the word of the
past and present and the true word of immortality;
no one can acquir for another--not one
not one can grow for another--not one

the song is to the singer and come back most to him
the teach is to the teacher and come back most to him
the murder is to the murder and come back most to him
the theft is to the thief and come back most to him
the love is to the lover and come back most to him
the gift is to the giver and come back most to him--it cannot fail
the orat is to the orat the act is to the actor and actress
not to the audienc
and no man understand ani great or good but hi own or
the indic of hi own

3
i swear the earth shall sure be complet to him or her who shall
be complet
the earth remain jag and broken onli to him or her who remain
jag and broken

i swear there is no great or power that doe not emul those
of the earth
there can be no theori of ani account unless it corrobor the
theori of the earth
no polit song religion behavior or what not is of account
unless it compar with the amplitud of the earth
unless it face the exact vital imparti rectitud of
the earth

i swear i begin to see love with sweeter spasm than that which
respond love
it is that which contain itself which never invit and never refus

i swear i begin to see littl or noth in audibl word
all merg toward the present of the unspoken mean of the earth
toward him who sing the song of the bodi and of the truth of the earth
toward him who make the dictionari of word that print cannot touch

i swear i see what is better than to tell the best
it is alway to leav the best untold

when i undertak to tell the best i find i cannot
my tongu is ineffectu on it pivot
my breath will not be obedi to it organ
i becom a dumb man

the best of the earth cannot be told anyhow all or ani is best
it is not what you anticip it is cheaper easier nearer
thing are not dismissd from the place they held befor
the earth is just as posit and direct as it wa befor
fact religion improv polit trade are as real as befor
but the soul is also real it too is posit and direct
no reason no proof ha establishd it
undeni growth ha establishd it

4
these to echo the tone of soul and the phrase of soul
(if they did not echo the phrase of soul what were they then?
if they had not refer to you in especi what were they then?)

i swear i will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tell
the best
i will have to do onli with that faith that leav the best untold

say on sayers! sing on singers!
delve! mould! pile the word of the earth!
work on age after age noth is to be lost
it may have to wait long but it will certainli come in use
when the materi are all prepar and readi the architect shall appear

i swear to you the architect shall appear without fall
i swear to you they will understand you and justifi you
the greatest among them shall be he who best know you and enclos
all and is faith to all
he and the rest shall not forget you they shall perceiv that you
are not an iota less than they
you shall be fulli glorifi in them



} youth day old age and night

youth larg lusti loving--youth full of grace forc fascin
do you know that old age may come after you with equal grace
forc fascination?

day full-blown and splendid-day of the immens sun action
ambit laughter
the night follow close with million of sun and sleep and
restor dark

for it the entir star-myriad roll through the sky

in spiral rout by long detour

for it the partial to the perman flow
for it the real to the ideal tend

for it the mystic evolut

out of the bad major the vari countless fraud of men and state
electr antisept yet cleav suffus all

3
over the mountain-growth diseas and sorrow
an uncaught bird is ever hover hover
high in the purer happier air

from imperfect murkiest cloud
dart alway forth one ray of perfect light
one flash of heaven glori

to fashion custom discord
to the mad babel-din the deafen orgi
sooth each lull a strain is heard just heard
from some far shore the final choru sound

o the blest eye the happi heart
that see that know the guid thread so fine
along the mighti labyrinth

4

for these (not for thyself) thou hast arriv

thou too surroundest all

o i have been dilatori and dumb

none ha understood you but i understand you
none ha done justic to you you have not done justic to yourself
none but ha found you imperfect i onli find no imperfect in you

no pluck no endur in other but as good is in you
no pleasur wait for other but an equal pleasur wait for you

} franc [the 18th year of these states]

a great year and place
a harsh discord natal scream out-sound to touch the mother
heart closer than ani yet

i walkd the shore of my eastern sea
heard over the wave the littl voic
saw the divin infant where she woke mourn wail amid the
roar of cannon curs shout crash of fall build
wa not so sick from the blood in the gutter run nor from the singl
corps nor those in heap nor those born away in the tumbril
wa not so desper at the battu of death--wa not so shockd at
the repeat fusillad of the gun

pale silent stern what could i say to that long-accru retribution?
could i wish human different?
could i wish the peopl made of wood and stone?
or that there be no justic in destini or time?

o liberty! o mate for me!
here too the blaze the grape-shot and the axe in reserv to fetch
them out in case of need
here too though long represt can never be destroyd
here too could rise at last murder and ecstat
here too demand full arrear of vengeanc

henc i sign thi salut over the sea
and i do not deni that terribl red birth and baptism
but rememb the littl voic that i heard wail and wait with
perfect trust no matter how long
and from to-day sad and cogent i maintain the bequeathd caus as
for all land
and i send these word to pari with my love
and i guess some chansonni there will understand them
for i guess there is latent music yet in franc flood of it
o i hear alreadi the bustl of instrument they will soon be
drown all that would interrupt them
o i think the east wind bring a triumphal and free march
it reach hither it swell me to joy mad
i will run transpos it in word to justifi
i will yet sing a song for you ma femm



} myself and mine

myself and mine gymnast ever

boat to manag hors to beget superb children
to speak readili and clearli to feel at home among common peopl

not for an embroider
(there will alway be plenti of embroider i welcom them also)
but for the fibr of thing and for inher men and women

not to chisel ornament
but to chisel with free stroke the head and limb of plenteou
suprem god that the state may realiz them walk and talk

let me have my own way
let other promulg the law i will make no account of the law
let other prais emin men and hold up peac i hold up agit

} year of meteor [1859-60]

year of meteors! brood year!
i would bind in word retrospect some of your deed and sign
i would sing your contest for the 19th presidentiad
i would sing how an old man tall with white hair mount the
scaffold in virginia
(i wa at hand silent i stood with teeth shut close i watchd
i stood veri near you old man when cool and indiffer but trembl
with age and your unheald wound you mount the scaffold;)
i would sing in my copiou song your censu return of the state
the tabl of popul and product i would sing of your ship
and their cargo
the proud black ship of manhattan arriv some filld with
immigr some from the isthmu with cargo of gold
song thereof would i sing to all that hitherward come would welcom give
and you would i sing fair stripling! welcom to you from me young
princ of england!
(rememb you surg manhattan crowd as you passd with your
corteg of nobles?
there in the crowd stood i and singl you out with attachment;)
nor forget i to sing of the wonder the ship as she swam up my bay
well-shap and state the great eastern swam up my bay she wa
600 feet long
her move swiftli surround by myriad of small craft i forget not
to sing;
nor the comet that came unannounc out of the north flare in heaven
nor the strang huge meteor-process dazzl and clear shoot
over our head
(a moment a moment long it saild it ball of unearthli light over
our head
then depart dropt in the night and wa gone;)
of such and fit as they i sing--with gleam from them would
gleam and patch these chant
your chant o year all mottl with evil and good--year of forebodings!
year of comet and meteor transient and strange--lo! even here one
equal transient and strange!
as i flit through you hastili soon to fall and be gone what is thi chant
what am i myself but one of your meteors?

out of the cradl endlessli rock
out of the mocking-bird throat the music shuttl
out of the ninth-month midnight
over the steril sand and the field beyond where the child
leav hi bed wanderd alon barehead barefoot
down from the showerd halo
up from the mystic play of shadow twine and twist as if they
were aliv
out from the patch of brier and blackberri
from the memori of the bird that chant to me
from your memori sad brother from the fit rise and fall i heard
from under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tear
from those begin note of yearn and love there in the mist
from the thousand respons of my heart never to ceas
from the myriad thence-arousd word
from the word stronger and more delici than ani
from such as now they start the scene revisit
as a flock twitter rise or overhead pass
born hither ere all elud me hurriedli
a man yet by these tear a littl boy again
throw myself on the sand confront the wave
i chanter of pain and joy unit of here and hereaft
take all hint to use them but swiftli leap beyond them
a reminisc sing

onc paumanok
when the lilac-sc wa in the air and fifth-month grass wa grow
up thi seashor in some brier
two featherd guest from alabama two togeth
and their nest and four light-green egg spot with brown
and everi day the he-bird to and fro near at hand
and everi day the she-bird crouchd on her nest silent with bright eye
and everi day i a curiou boy never too close never disturb

cautious peer absorb translat

shine! shine! shine!
pour down your warmth great sun
while we bask we two togeth

two together!
wind blow south or wind blow north
day come white or night come black
home or river and mountain from home
sing all time mind no time
while we two keep togeth

till of a sudden
may-b killd unknown to her mate
one forenoon the she-bird crouchd not on the nest
nor returnd that afternoon nor the next
nor ever appeard again

and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea
and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather
over the hoars surg of the sea
or flit from brier to brier by day
i saw i heard at interv the remain one the he-bird
the solitari guest from alabama

blow! blow! blow!
blow up sea-wind along paumanok shore;
i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me

ye when the star glistend
all night long on the prong of a moss-scallopd stake
down almost amid the slap wave
sat the lone singer wonder caus tear

he calld on hi mate
he pourd forth the mean which i of all men know

ye my brother i know
the rest might not but i have treasurd everi note
for more than onc dimli down to the beach glide
silent avoid the moonbeam blend myself with the shadow
recal now the obscur shape the echo the sound and sight

listend long and long

listend to keep to sing now translat the note

and again anoth behind embrac and lap everi one close

low hang the moon it rose late
it is lagging--o i think it is heavi with love with love

o madli the sea push upon the land
with love with love

o night! do i not see my love flutter out among the breakers?
what is that littl black thing i see there in the white?

loud! loud! loud!
loud i call to you my love!
high and clear i shoot my voic over the wave
sure you must know who is here is here
you must know who i am my love

low-hang moon!

o it is the shape the shape of my mate
o moon do not keep her from me ani longer

if you onli would
for i am almost sure i see her dimli whichev way i look

o rise stars!
perhap the one i want so much will rise will rise with some of you

o throat! o trembl throat!
sound clearer through the atmosphere!
pierc the wood the earth
somewher listen to catch you must be the one i want

shake out carols!
solitari here the night carols!
carol of lonesom love! death carols!
carol under that lag yellow wane moon!
o under that moon where she droop almost down into the sea!
o reckless despair carol

but soft! sink low!
soft! let me just murmur
and do you wait a moment you husky-noisd sea
for somewher i believ i heard my mate respond to me
so faint i must be still be still to listen
but not altogeth still for then she might not come immedi to me

hither my love!
here i am! here!
with thi just-sustaind note i announc myself to you
thi gentl call is for you my love for you

do not be decoyd elsewher
that is the whistl of the wind it is not my voic
that is the flutter the flutter of the spray
those are the shadow of leav

o darkness! o in vain!
o i am veri sick and sorrow

o brown halo in the sky near the moon droop upon the sea!
o troubl reflect in the sea!
o throat! o throb heart!
and i sing uselessli uselessli all the night

o past! o happi life! o song of joy!
in the air in the wood over field
loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
but my mate no more no more with me!
we two togeth no more

with angri moan the fierc old mother incessantli moan
on the sand of paumanok shore gray and rustl
the yellow half-moon enlarg sag down droop the face of

the boy ecstat with hi bare feet the wave with hi hair the
atmospher dalli
the love in the heart long pent now loos now at last tumultu

the aria mean the ear the soul swiftli deposit
the strang tear down the cheek cours
the colloquy there the trio each utter
the underton the savag old mother incessantli cri
to the boy soul question sullenli time some drownd secret hiss
to the outset bard

demon or bird! (said the boy soul)
is it inde toward your mate you sing? or is it realli to me?
for i that wa a child my tongu use sleep now i have heard you
now in a moment i know what i am for i awak
and alreadi a thousand singer a thousand song clearer louder
and more sorrow than your
a thousand warbl echo have start to life within me never to die

o you singer solitari sing by yourself project me
o solitari me listen never more shall i ceas perpetu you
never more shall i escap never more the reverber
never more the cri of unsatisfi love be absent from me
never again leav me to be the peac child i wa befor what
there in the night
by the sea under the yellow and sag moon
the messeng there arousd the fire the sweet hell within
the unknown want the destini of me

o give me the clue! (it lurk in the night here somewhere)
o if i am to have so much let me have more!

a word then (for i will conquer it)
the word final superior to all
subtl sent up--what is it?--i listen;
are you whisper it and have been all the time you sea-waves?
is that it from your liquid rim and wet sands?

whereto answer the sea
delay not hurri not
whisperd me through the night and veri plainli befor daybreak
lispd to me the low and delici word death
and again death death death death
hiss melodi neither like the bird nor like my arousd child heart
but edg near as privat for me rustl at my feet
creep thenc steadili up to my ear and lave me softli all over
death death death death death

which i do not forget
but fuse the song of my duski demon and brother
that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok gray beach
with the thousand respons song at random
my own song awak from that hour
and with them the key the word up from the wave
the word of the sweetest song and all song
that strong and delici word which creep to my feet
(or like some old crone rock the cradl swath in sweet
garment bend aside)
the sea whisperd me

as i ebbd with the ocean of life
as i wend the shore i know
as i walkd where the rippl continu wash you paumanok
where they rustl up hoars and sibil
where the fierc old mother endlessli cri for her castaway
i muse late in the autumn day gaze off southward
held by thi electr self out of the pride of which i utter poem
wa seizd by the spirit that trail in the line underfoot
the rim the sediment that stand for all the water and all the land
of the globe

fascin my eye revert from the south dropt to follow those
slender windrow
chaff straw splinter of wood weed and the sea-gluten
scum scale from shine rock leav of salt-lettuc left by the tide
mile walk the sound of break wave the other side of me
paumanok there and then as i thought the old thought of like
these you present to me you fish-shap island

as i walkd with that electr self seek type

as i list to the dirg the voic of men and women wreckd
as i inhal the impalp breez that set in upon me
as the ocean so mysteri roll toward me closer and closer
i too but signifi at the utmost a littl washd-up drift
a few sand and dead leav to gather
gather and merg myself as part of the sand and drift

o baffl balkd bent to the veri earth
oppressd with myself that i have dare to open my mouth
awar now that amid all that blab whose echo recoil upon me i have
not onc had the least idea who or what i am
but that befor all my arrog poem the real me stand yet
untouchd untold altogeth unreachd
withdrawn far mock me with mock-congratulatori sign and bow
with peal of distant iron laughter at everi word i have written
point in silenc to these song and then to the sand beneath

i perceiv i have not realli understood ani thing not a singl
object and that no man ever can
natur here in sight of the sea take advantag of me to dart upon
me and sting me
becaus i have dare to open my mouth to sing at all

3

we murmur alik reproach roll sand and drift know not whi
these littl shred inde stand for you and me and all

you friabl shore with trail of debri
you fish-shap island i take what is underfoot
what is your is mine my father

i too paumanok
i too have bubbl up float the measureless float and been
washd on your shore
i too am but a trail of drift and debri
i too leav littl wreck upon you you fish-shap island

i throw myself upon your breast my father
i cling to you so that you cannot unloos me
i hold you so firm till you answer me someth

kiss me my father
touch me with your lip as i touch those i love
breath to me while i hold you close the secret of the murmur i envi

4
ebb ocean of life (the flow will return)
ceas not your moan you fierc old mother
endlessli cri for your castaway but fear not deni not me
rustl not up so hoars and angri against my feet as i touch you or
gather from you

i mean tenderli by you and all
i gather for myself and for thi phantom look down where we lead
and follow me and mine

(see from my dead lip the ooz exud at last
see the prismat color glisten and rolling)
tuft of straw sand fragment
buoyd hither from mani mood one contradict anoth
from the storm the long calm the dark the swell
muse ponder a breath a brini tear a dab of liquid or soil
up just as much out of fathomless work ferment and thrown
a limp blossom or two torn just as much over wave float
drift at random
just as much for us that sob dirg of natur
just as much whenc we come that blare of the cloud-trumpet
we caprici brought hither we know not whenc spread out befor you
you up there walk or sit
whoever you are we too lie in drift at your feet

} a boston ballad [1854]

to get betim in boston town i rose thi morn earli
here a good place at the corner i must stand and see the show

clear the way there jonathan!
way for the presid marshal--way for the govern cannon!
way for the feder foot and dragoon (and the apparit
copious tumbling)

i love to look on the star and stripe i hope the fife will play
yanke doodl
how bright shine the cutlass of the foremost troops!
everi man hold hi revolv march stiff through boston town

a fog follow antiqu of the same come limp
some appear wooden-leg and some appear bandag and bloodless

whi thi is inde a show--it ha call the dead out of the earth!
the old graveyard of the hill have hurri to see!
phantoms! phantom countless by flank and rear!
cockd hat of mothi mould--crutch made of mist!
arm in slings--old men lean on young men shoulder

what troubl you yanke phantoms? what is all thi chatter of
bare gums?
doe the agu convuls your limbs? do you mistak your crutch for
firelock and level them?

if you blind your eye with tear you will not see the presid marshal
if you groan such groan you might balk the govern cannon

for shame old maniacs--br down those tossd arm and let your
white hair be
here gape your great grandson their wive gaze at them from the window
see how well dressd see how orderli they conduct themselv

wors and worse--c you stand it? are you retreating?
is thi hour with the live too dead for you?

retreat then--pell-mell!
to your graves--back--back to the hill old limpers!
i do not think you belong here anyhow

but there is one thing that belong here--shal i tell you what it
is gentlemen of boston?

i will whisper it to the mayor he shall send a committe to england
they shall get a grant from the parliament go with a cart to the
royal vault
dig out king georg coffin unwrap him quick from the
gravecloth box up hi bone for a journey
find a swift yanke clipper--her is freight for you black-belli clipper
up with your anchor--shak out your sails--steer straight toward
boston bay

now call for the presid marshal again bring out the govern cannon
fetch home the roarer from congress make anoth process
guard it with foot and dragoon

thi centre-piec for them;
look all orderli citizens--look from the window women!

the committe open the box set up the regal rib glue those that
will not stay
clap the skull on top of the rib and clap a crown on top of the skull
you have got your reveng old buster--th crown is come to it own
and more than it own

stick your hand in your pocket jonathan--y are a made man from
thi day
you are mighti cute--and here is one of your bargain

then loosen launch forth to go and compet

on float the wind over the breast of the sea set in toward land
the great steadi wind from west or west-by-south
float so buoyant with milk-whit foam on the water

but i am not the sea nor the red sun
i am not the wind with girlish laughter
not the immens wind which strengthen not the wind which lash
not the spirit that ever lash it own bodi to terror and death

which the bird know in the wood morn and even

over hill across lowland and in the skirt of wood
and along the shore in mire (now filld over) came again and
suddenli rage
as eighty-f year agon no mere parad receivd with applaus of friend
but a battl which i took part in myself--ay long ago as it is i
took part in it
walk then thi hilltop thi same ground

aye thi is the ground
my blind eye even as i speak behold it re-peopl from grave
the year reced pavement and state hous disappear
rude fort appear again the old hoopd gun are mount
i see the line of raisd earth stretch from river to bay
i mark the vista of water i mark the upland and slopes;
here we lay encampd it wa thi time in summer also

as i talk i rememb all i rememb the declar
it wa read here the whole armi parad it wa read to us here
by hi staff surround the gener stood in the middl he held up
hi unsheathd sword
it glitterd in the sun in full sight of the armi

twa a bold act then--th english war-ship had just arriv
we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor
and the transport swarm with soldier

a few day more and they land and then the battl

twenti thousand were brought against us
a veteran forc furnishd with good artilleri

i tell not now the whole of the battl
but one brigad earli in the forenoon orderd forward to engag the
red-coat
of that brigad i tell and how steadili it marchd
and how long and well it stood confront death

who do you think that wa march steadili sternli confront death?
it wa the brigad of the youngest men two thousand strong
raisd in virginia and maryland and most of them known person

jauntili forward they went with quick step toward gowanu water
till of a sudden unlookd for by defil through the wood gaind at night
the british advanc round in from the east fierc play

that brigad of the youngest wa cut off and at the enemi merci

the gener watchd them from thi hill
they made repeat desper attempt to burst their environ
then drew close togeth veri compact their flag fli in the middl
but o from the hill how the cannon were thin and thin them!

it sicken me yet that slaughter!
i saw the moistur gather in drop on the face of the gener
i saw how he wrung hi hand in anguish

meanwhil the british manoeuvrd to draw us out for a pitchd battl
but we dare not trust the chanc of a pitchd battl

we fought the fight in detach
salli forth we fought at sever point but in each the luck wa
against us
our foe advanc steadili get the best of it pushd us back
to the work on thi hill
till we turnd menac here and then he left us

that wa the go out of the brigad of the youngest men two thousand
strong
few returnd nearli all remain in brooklyn

that and here my gener first battl
no women look on nor sunshin to bask in it did not conclud
with applaus
nobodi clappd hand here then

but in dark in mist on the ground under a chill rain
weari that night we lay foild and sullen
while scorn laughd mani an arrog lord off against us encampd
quit within hear feast clink wineglass togeth over

to the alleghanian hill and the tireless mississippi
to the rock i call sing and all the tree in the wood
to the plain of the poem of hero to the prairi spread wide
to the far-off sea and the unseen wind and the sane impalp air;
and respond they answer all (but not in words)
the averag earth the wit of war and peac acknowledg mute
the prairi draw me close as the father to bosom broad the son
the northern ice and rain that began me nourish me to the end
but the hot sun of the south is to fulli ripen my song

} when lilac last in the dooryard bloomd

1
when lilac last in the dooryard bloomd
and the great star earli droopd in the western sky in the night
i mournd and yet shall mourn with ever-return spring

ever-return spring triniti sure to me you bring
lilac bloom perenni and droop star in the west
and thought of him i love

2
o power western fallen star!
o shade of night--o moodi tear night!
o great star disappeard--o the black murk that hide the star!
o cruel hand that hold me powerless--o helpless soul of me!
o harsh surround cloud that will not free my soul


3
in the dooryard front an old farm-hous near the white-washd pale
stand the lilac-bush tall-grow with heart-shap leav of rich green
with mani a point blossom rise delic with the perfum strong i love
with everi leaf a miracle--and from thi bush in the dooryard
with delicate-colord blossom and heart-shap leav of rich green
a sprig with it flower i break

4
in the swamp in seclud recess
a shi and hidden bird is warbl a song

solitari the thrush
the hermit withdrawn to himself avoid the settlement
sing by himself a song

song of the bleed throat
death outlet song of life (for well dear brother i know
if thou wast not grant to sing thou wouldist sure die)

5
over the breast of the spring the land amid citi
amid lane and through old wood where late the violet peepd
from the ground spot the gray debri
amid the grass in the field each side of the lane pass the
endless grass
pass the yellow-speard wheat everi grain from it shroud in the
dark-brown field uprisen
pass the apple-tre blow of white and pink in the orchard
carri a corps to where it shall rest in the grave
night and day journey a coffin

6
coffin that pass through lane and street
through day and night with the great cloud darken the land
with the pomp of the inloopd flag with the citi drape in black
with the show of the state themselv as of crape-veild women stand
with process long and wind and the flambeau of the night
with the countless torch lit with the silent sea of face and the
unbar head
with the wait depot the arriv coffin and the sombr face
with dirg through the night with the thousand voic rise strong
and solemn
with all the mourn voic of the dirg pourd around the coffin
the dim-lit church and the shudder organs--wher amid these
you journey
with the toll toll bell perpetu clang
here coffin that slowli pass
i give you my sprig of lilac

7
(nor for you for one alon
blossom and branch green to coffin all i bring

all over bouquet of rose
o death i cover you over with rose and earli lili
but mostli and now the lilac that bloom the first
copiou i break i break the sprig from the bush
with load arm i come pour for you
for you and the coffin all of you o death)

8
o western orb sail the heaven
now i know what you must have meant as a month sinc i walkd
as i walkd in silenc the transpar shadowi night
as i saw you had someth to tell as you bent to me night after night
as you droopd from the sky low down as if to my side (while the
other star all lookd on)
as we wanderd togeth the solemn night (for someth i know not
what kept me from sleep)
as the night advanc and i saw on the rim of the west how full you
were of woe
as i stood on the rise ground in the breez in the cool transpar night
as i watchd where you passd and wa lost in the netherward black
of the night
as my soul in it troubl dissatisfi sank as where you sad orb
conclud dropt in the night and wa gone

9
sing on there in the swamp
o singer bash and tender i hear your note i hear your call
i hear i come present i understand you
but a moment i linger for the lustrou star ha detaind me
the star my depart comrad hold and detain me

10
o how shall i warbl myself for the dead one there i loved?
and how shall i deck my song for the larg sweet soul that ha gone?
and what shall my perfum be for the grave of him i love?

sea-wind blown from east and west
blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea till
there on the prairi meet
these and with these and the breath of my chant
ill perfum the grave of him i love

11
o what shall i hang on the chamber walls?
and what shall the pictur be that i hang on the wall
to adorn the burial-hous of him i love?
pictur of grow spring and farm and home
with the fourth-month eve at sundown and the gray smoke lucid and bright
with flood of the yellow gold of the gorgeou indol sink
sun burn expand the air
with the fresh sweet herbag under foot and the pale green leav
of the tree prolif
in the distanc the flow glaze the breast of the river with a
wind-dappl here and there
with rang hill on the bank with mani a line against the sky
and shadow
and the citi at hand with dwell so dens and stack of chimney
and all the scene of life and the workshop and the workmen
homeward return

12
lo bodi and soul--thi land
my own manhattan with spire and the sparkl and hurri tide
and the ship

ohio shore and flash missouri
and ever the far-spread prairi coverd with grass and corn

lo the most excel sun so calm and haughti
the violet and purpl morn with just-felt breez
the gentl soft-born measureless light
the miracl spread bath all the fulfilld noon
the come eve delici the welcom night and the star

13
sing on sing on you gray-brown bird
sing from the swamp the recess pour your chant from the bush
limitless out of the dusk out of the cedar and pine

sing on dearest brother warbl your reedi song
loud human song with voic of uttermost woe

o liquid and free and tender!
o wild and loos to my soul--o wondrou singer!
you onli i hear--yet the star hold me (but will soon depart)
yet the lilac with master odor hold me

14
now while i sat in the day and lookd forth
in the close of the day with it light and the field of spring and
the farmer prepar their crop
in the larg unconsci sceneri of my land with it lake and forest
in the heavenli aerial beauti (after the perturbd wind and the storms)
under the arch heaven of the afternoon swift pass and the
voic of children and women
the many-mov sea-tid and i saw the ship how they saild
and the summer approach with rich and the field all busi
with labor
and the infinit separ hous how they all went on each with
it meal and minutia of daili usag
and the street how their throb throbbd and the citi pent--
lo then and there
fall upon them all and among them all envelop me with the rest
appeard the cloud appeard the long black trail
and i knew death it thought and the sacr knowledg of death

then with the knowledg of death as walk one side of me
and the thought of death close-walk the other side of me
and i in the middl as with companion and as hold the hand of
companion
i fled forth to the hide receiv night that talk not
down to the shore of the water the path by the swamp in the dim
to the solemn shadowi cedar and ghostli pine so still

and the singer so shi to the rest receivd me
the gray-brown bird i know receivd us comrad three
and he sang the carol of death and a vers for him i love

from deep seclud recess
from the fragrant cedar and the ghostli pine so still
came the carol of the bird

and the charm of the carol rapt me
as i held as if by their hand my comrad in the night
and the voic of my spirit talli the song of the bird

come love and sooth death
undul round the world seren arriv arriv
in the day in the night to all to each
sooner or later delic death

praisd be the fathomless univers
for life and joy and for object and knowledg curiou
and for love sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!
for the sure-enwind arm of cool-enfold death

dark mother alway glide near with soft feet
have none chant for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
then i chant it for thee i glorifi thee abov all
i bring thee a song that when thou must inde come come unfalteringli

approach strong deliveress
when it is so when thou hast taken them i joyous sing the dead
lost in the love float ocean of thee
lave in the flood of thi bliss o death

from me to thee glad serenad
danc for thee i propos salut thee adorn and feast for thee
and the sight of the open landscap and the high-spread shi are fit
and life and the field and the huge and thought night

the night in silenc under mani a star
the ocean shore and the huski whisper wave whose voic i know
and the soul turn to thee o vast and well-veild death
and the bodi grate nestl close to thee

over the tree-top i float thee a song
over the rise and sink wave over the myriad field and the
prairi wide
over the dense-packd citi all and the teem wharv and way
i float thi carol with joy with joy to thee o death

15
to the talli of my soul
loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird
with pure deliber note spread fill the night

loud in the pine and cedar dim
clear in the fresh moist and the swamp-perfum
and i with my comrad there in the night

while my sight that wa bound in my eye unclos
as to long panorama of vision

and i saw askant the armi
i saw as in noiseless dream hundr of battle-flag
born through the smoke of the battl and piercd with missil i saw them
and carri hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloodi
and at last but a few shred left on the staff (and all in silence)
and the staff all splinterd and broken

i saw battle-corps myriad of them
and the white skeleton of young men i saw them
i saw the debri and debri of all the slain soldier of the war
but i saw they were not as wa thought
they themselv were fulli at rest they sufferd not
the live remaind and sufferd the mother sufferd
and the wife and the child and the muse comrad sufferd
and the armi that remaind sufferd

16
pass the vision pass the night
pass unloos the hold of my comrad hand
pass the song of the hermit bird and the talli song of my soul
victori song death outlet song yet vari ever-alt song
as low and wail yet clear the note rise and fall
flood the night
sadli sink and faint as warn and warn and yet again
burst with joy
cover the earth and fill the spread of the heaven
as that power psalm in the night i heard from recess
pass i leav thee lilac with heart-shap leav
i leav thee there in the door-yard bloom return with spring

i ceas from my song for thee
from my gaze on thee in the west front the west commun with thee
o comrad lustrou with silver face in the night

yet each to keep and all retriev out of the night
the song the wondrou chant of the gray-brown bird
and the talli chant the echo arousd in my soul
with the lustrou and droop star with the counten full of woe
with the holder hold my hand near the call of the bird
comrad mine and i in the midst and their memori ever to keep for
the dead i love so well
for the sweetest wisest soul of all my day and lands--and thi for
hi dear sake
lilac and star and bird twine with the chant of my soul
there in the fragrant pine and the cedar dusk and dim

the stretch light-hung roof of cloud the clear cerulean and the
silveri fring
the high-dil star the placid beckon star
the move flock and herd the plain and emerald meadow
the show of all the vari land and all the growth and product

thou groanst with rich thi wealth cloth thee as a swathing-gar
thou laughest loud with ach of great possess
a myriad-twin life like interlac vine bind all thi vast demesn
as some huge ship freight to water edg thou ridest into port
as rain fall from the heaven and vapor rise from earth so have
the preciou valu fallen upon thee and risen out of thee;

thou bath choke swim in plenti
thou lucki mistress of the tranquil barn
thou prairi dame that sittest in the middl and lookest out upon

dispensatress that by a word givest a thousand mile a million
farm and missest noth

when late i sang sad wa my voic
sad were the show around me with deafen nois of hatr and
smoke of war;
in the midst of the conflict the hero i stood
or passd with slow step through the wound and die

but now i sing not war
nor the measurd march of soldier nor the tent of camp
nor the regiment hastili come up deploy in line of battle;
no more the sad unnatur show of war

askd room those flushd immort rank the first forth-step armies?
ask room ala the ghastli rank the armi dread that followd

(pass pass ye proud brigad with your tramp sinewi leg
with your shoulder young and strong with your knapsack and your muskets;
how elat i stood and watchd you where start off you marchd

pass--then rattl drum again
for an armi heav in sight o anoth gather armi
swarm trail on the rear o you dread accru armi
o you regiment so piteou with your mortal diarrhoea with your fever
o my land maimd darl with the plenteou bloodi bandag and
the crutch
lo your pallid armi follows)

5
but on these day of bright
on the far-stretch beauteou landscap the road and lane the
high-pil farm-wagon and the fruit and barn
should the dead intrude?

ah the dead to me mar not they fit well in natur
they fit veri well in the landscap under the tree and grass
and along the edg of the sky in the horizon far margin

nor do i forget you depart
nor in winter or summer my lost one
but most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peac
like pleas phantom
your memori rise glide silent by me

6

(yet the hero never surpassd shall never return
them that day i saw not)

i saw the intermin corp i saw the process of armi
i saw them approach defil by with divis

mighti camp

no holiday soldiers--youth yet veteran
worn swart handsom strong of the stock of homestead and workshop
hardend of mani a long campaign and sweati march
inur on mani a hard-fought bloodi field

a pause--th armi wait
a million flushd embattl conqueror wait
the world too wait then soft as break night and sure as dawn
they melt they disappear

exult o lands! victori lands!
not there your victori on those red shudder field
but here and henc your victori

melt melt away ye armies--dispers ye blue-clad soldier
resolv ye back again give up for good your deadli arm
other the arm the field henceforth for you or south or north

how can you be aliv you growth of spring?
how can you furnish health you blood of herb root orchard grain?
are they not continu put distemperd corps within you?
is not everi contin workd over and over with sour dead?

where have you dispos of their carcasses?

where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
i do not see ani of it upon you to-day or perhap i am deceivd
i will run a furrow with my plough i will press my spade through

i am sure i shall expos some of the foul meat

o fear thought--a convict soul

1
rang the refrain along the hall the prison
rose to the roof the vault of heaven abov
pour in flood of melodi in tone so pensiv sweet and strong the
like whereof wa never heard
reach the far-off sentri and the arm guard who ceasd their pace
make the hearer puls stop for ecstasi and awe

2
the sun wa low in the west one winter day
when down a narrow aisl amid the thiev and outlaw of the land
(there by the hundr seat sear-fac murder wili counterfeit
gatherd to sunday church in prison wall the keeper round
plenteou well-arm watch with vigil eyes)
calmli a ladi walkd hold a littl innoc child by either hand
whom seat on their stool besid her on the platform
she first prelud with the instrument a low and music prelud
in voic surpass all sang forth a quaint old hymn

a soul confin by bar and band
cri help! o help! and wring her hand
blind her eye bleed her breast
nor pardon find nor balm of rest

ceaseless she pace to and fro
o heart-sick days! o night of woe!
nor hand of friend nor love face
nor favor come nor word of grace

it wa not i that sinnd the sin
the ruthless bodi draggd me in;
though long i strove courag
the bodi wa too much for me

dear prisond soul bear up a space
for soon or late the certain grace;
to set thee free and bear thee home
the heavenli pardon death shall come

convict no more nor shame nor dole!
depart--a god-enfranchisd soul!

the singer ceasd
one glanc swept from her clear calm eye oer all those upturnd face
strang sea of prison face a thousand vari crafti brutal
seamd and beauteou face
then rise pass back along the narrow aisl between them
while her gown touchd them rustl in the silenc
she vanishd with her children in the dusk

while upon all convict and arm keeper ere they stirrd
(convict forget prison keeper hi load pistol)
a hush and paus fell down a wondrou minut
with deep half-stifl sob and sound of bad men bowd and move to weep
and youth convuls breath memori of home
the mother voic in lullabi the sister care the happi childhood
the long-pent spirit rousd to reminiscence;
a wondrou minut then--but after in the solitari night to mani
mani there
year after even in the hour of death the sad refrain the tune
the voic the word
resum the larg calm ladi walk the narrow aisl
the wail melodi again the singer in the prison sing

o sight of piti shame and dole!
o fear thought--a convict soul

as of the far-back day the poet tell the paradiso
the stray thenc the separ long but now the wander done
the journey done the journeyman come home
and man and art with natur fuse again

tutti! for earth and heaven;
(the almighti leader now for onc ha signald with hi wand)

the manli stroph of the husband of the world
and all the wive respond

the tongu of violin
(i think o tongu ye tell thi heart that cannot tell itself
thi brood yearn heart that cannot tell itself)

ah from a littl child
thou knowest soul how to me all sound becam music
my mother voic in lullabi or hymn
(the voic o tender voic memori love voic
last miracl of all o dearest mother sister voices;)
the rain the grow corn the breez among the long-leavd corn
the measurd sea-surf beat on the sand
the twitter bird the hawk sharp scream
the wild-fowl note at night as fli low migrat north or south
the psalm in the countri church or mid the cluster tree the
open air camp-meet
the fiddler in the tavern the glee the long-strung sailor-song
the low cattl bleat sheep the crow cock at dawn

all song of current land come sound round me
the german air of friendship wine and love
irish ballad merri jig and danc english warbl
chanson of franc scotch tune and oer the rest
italia peerless composit

across the stage with pallor on her face yet lurid passion
stalk norma brandish the dagger in her hand

i see poor craze lucia eye unnatur gleam
her hair down her back fall loos and disheveld

i see where ernani walk the bridal garden
amid the scent of night-ros radiant hold hi bride by the hand
hear the infern call the death-pledg of the horn

to cross sword and gray hair bare to heaven
the clear electr base and bariton of the world
the trombon duo libertad forever!
from spanish chestnut tree dens shade
by old and heavi convent wall a wail song
song of lost love the torch of youth and life quenchd in despair
song of the die swan fernando heart is break

awak from her woe at last retrievd amina sing
copiou as star and glad as morn light the torrent of her joy

(the teem ladi come
the lustriou orb venu contralto the bloom mother
sister of loftiest god alboni self i hear)

i hear those ode symphoni opera
i hear in the william tell the music of an arousd and angri peopl
i hear meyerb huguenot the prophet or robert
gounod faust or mozart don juan

i hear the dance-mus of all nation
the waltz some delici measur laps bath me in bliss
the bolero to tinkl guitar and clatter castanet

i see religi danc old and new
i hear the sound of the hebrew lyre
i see the crusad march bear the cross on high to the
martial clang of cymbal
i hear dervish monoton chant interspersd with frantic
shout as they spin around turn alway toward mecca
i see the rapt religi danc of the persian and the arab
again at eleusi home of cere i see the modern greek danc
i hear them clap their hand as they bend their bodi
i hear the metric shuffl of their feet

i see again the wild old corybantian danc the perform wound
each other
i see the roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolet throw and
catch their weapon
as they fall on their knee and rise again

i hear from the mussulman mosqu the muezzin call
i see the worshipp within nor form nor sermon argument nor word
but silent strang devout raisd glow head ecstat face

i hear the egyptian harp of mani string
the primit chant of the nile boatmen
the sacr imperi hymn of china
to the delic sound of the king (the stricken wood and stone)
or to hindu flute and the fret twang of the vina
a band of bayader

5
now asia africa leav me europ seiz inflat me
to organ huge and band i hear as from vast concours of voic
luther strong hymn ein fest burg ist unser gott
rossini stabat mater dolorosa
or float in some high cathedr dim with gorgeou colord window
the passion agnu dei or gloria in excelsi

composers! mighti maestros!
and you sweet singer of old land soprani tenori bassi!
to you a new bard carol in the west
obeis send hi love

(such led to thee o soul
all sens show and object lead to thee
but now it seem to me sound lead oer all the rest)

i hear the annual sing of the children in st paul cathedr
or under the high roof of some coloss hall the symphoni
oratorio of beethoven handel or haydn
the creation in billow of godhood lave me

give me to hold all sound (i madli struggl cry)
fill me with all the voic of the univers
endow me with their throb natur also
the tempest water wind opera and chant march and danc
utter pour in for i would take them all!

6
then i woke softli
and paus question awhil the music of my dream
and question all those reminisc the tempest in it furi
and all the song of soprano and tenor
and those rapt orient danc of religi fervor
and the sweet vari instrument and the diapason of organ
and all the artless plaint of love and grief and death
i said to my silent curiou soul out of the bed of the slumber-chamb
come for i have found the clew i sought so long
let us go forth refreshd amid the day
cheer talli life walk the world the real
nourishd henceforth by our celesti dream

and i said moreov
hapli what thou hast heard o soul wa not the sound of wind
nor dream of rage storm nor sea-hawk flap wing nor harsh scream
nor vocal of sun-bright itali
nor german organ majest nor vast concours of voic nor layer
of harmoni
nor stroph of husband and wive nor sound of march soldier
nor flute nor harp nor the bugle-cal of camp
but to a new rhythmu fit for thee
poem bridg the way from life to death vagu waft in night
air uncaught unwritten
which let us go forth in the bold day and write

} prayer of columbu

a batterd wreckd old man
thrown on thi savag shore far far from home
pent by the sea and dark rebelli brow twelv dreari month
sore stiff with mani toil sickend and nigh to death
i take my way along the island edg
vent a heavi heart

i am too full of woe!
hapli i may not live anoth day;
i cannot rest o god i cannot eat or drink or sleep
till i put forth myself my prayer onc more to thee
breath bath myself onc more in thee commun with thee
report myself onc more to thee

thou knowest my year entir my life
my long and crowd life of activ work not ador merely;
thou knowest the prayer and vigil of my youth
thou knowest my manhood solemn and visionari medit
thou knowest how befor i commenc i devot all to come to thee
thou knowest i have in age ratifi all those vow and strictli kept them
thou knowest i have not onc lost nor faith nor ecstasi in thee
in shackl prisond in disgrac repin not
accept all from thee as duli come from thee

all my empris have been filld with thee
my specul plan begun and carri on in thought of thee
sail the deep or journey the land for thee;
intent purport aspir mine leav result to thee

o i am sure they realli came from thee
the urg the ardor the unconquer will
the potent felt interior command stronger than word
a messag from the heaven whisper to me even in sleep
these sped me on

by me and these the work so far accomplishd
by me earth elder cloyd and stifl land uncloyd unloosd
by me the hemispher round and tie the unknown to the known

the end i know not it is all in thee
or small or great i know not--hapli what broad field what land
hapli the brutish measureless human undergrowth i know
transplant there may rise to statur knowledg worthi thee
hapli the sword i know may there inde be turnd to reaping-tool
hapli the lifeless cross i know europ dead cross may bud and
blossom there

one effort more my altar thi bleak sand;
that thou o god my life hast light
with ray of light steadi ineff vouchsaf of thee
light rare untel light the veri light
beyond all sign descript languages;
for that o god be it my latest word here on my knee
old poor and paralyz i thank thee

my terminu near
the cloud alreadi close in upon me
the voyag balkd the cours disput lost
i yield my ship to thee

my hand my limb grow nerveless
my brain feel rackd bewilderd
let the old timber part i will not part
i will cling fast to thee o god though the wave buffet me
thee thee at least i know

is it the prophet thought i speak or am i raving?
what do i know of life? what of myself?
i know not even my own work past or present
dim ever-shift guess of it spread befor me
of newer better world their mighti parturit
mock perplex me

and these thing i see suddenli what mean they?
as if some miracl some hand divin unseald my eye
shadowi vast shape smile through the air and sky
and on the distant wave sail countless ship
and anthem in new tongu i hear salut me

} the sleeper

1
i wander all night in my vision
step with light feet swiftli and noiselessli step and stop
bend with open eye over the shut eye of sleeper
wander and confus lost to myself ill-assort contradictori
paus gaze bend and stop

how solemn they look there stretchd and still
how quiet they breath the littl children in their cradl

the wretch featur of ennuy the white featur of corps the
livid face of drunkard the sick-gray face of onanist
the gashd bodi on battle-field the insan in their
strong-doord room the sacr idiot the new-born emerg
from gate and the die emerg from gate
the night pervad them and infold them

the marri coupl sleep calmli in their bed he with hi palm on
the hip of the wife and she with her palm on the hip of the husband
the sister sleep lovingli side by side in their bed
the men sleep lovingli side by side in their
and the mother sleep with her littl child care wrapt

the blind sleep and the deaf and dumb sleep
the prison sleep well in the prison the runaway son sleep
the murder that is to be hung next day how doe he sleep?
and the murderd person how doe he sleep?

the femal that love unrequit sleep
and the male that love unrequit sleep
the head of the money-mak that plot all day sleep
and the enrag and treacher disposit all all sleep

i stand in the dark with droop eye by the worst-suff and
the most restless
i pass my hand soothingli to and fro a few inch from them
the restless sink in their bed they fit sleep

now i pierc the dark new be appear
the earth reced from me into the night
i saw that it wa beauti and i see that what is not the earth is
beauti

i go from bedsid to bedsid i sleep close with the other sleeper
each in turn
i dream in my dream all the dream of the other dreamer
and i becom the other dreamer

i am a dance--play up there! the fit is whirl me fast!

i am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight
i see the hide of douceur i see nimbl ghost whichev way look
cach and cach again deep in the ground and sea and where it is
neither ground nor sea

well do they do their job those journeymen divin
onli from me can they hide noth and would not if they could
i reckon i am their boss and they make me a pet besid
and surround me and lead me and run ahead when i walk
to lift their cun cover to signifi me with stretchd arm and
resum the way;
onward we move a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shout
music and wild-flap pennant of joy!

i am the actor the actress the voter the politician
the emigr and the exil the crimin that stood in the box
he who ha been famou and he who shall be famou after to-day
the stammer the well-formd person the wast or feebl person

i am she who adornd herself and fold her hair expectantli
my truant lover ha come and it is dark

doubl yourself and receiv me dark
receiv me and my lover too he will not let me go without him

i roll myself upon you as upon a bed i resign myself to the dusk

he whom i call answer me and take the place of my lover
he rise with me silent from the bed

dark you are gentler than my lover hi flesh wa sweati and pant
i feel the hot moistur yet that he left me

my hand are spread forth i pass them in all direct
i would sound up the shadowi shore to which you are journey

be care darkness! alreadi what wa it touchd me?
i thought my lover had gone els dark and he are one
i hear the heart-beat i follow i fade away

2
i descend my western cours my sinew are flaccid
perfum and youth cours through me and i am their wake

it is my face yellow and wrinkl instead of the old woman
i sit low in a straw-bottom chair and care darn my grandson
stock

it is i too the sleepless widow look out on the winter midnight
i see the sparkl of starshin on the ici and pallid earth

a shroud i see and i am the shroud i wrap a bodi and lie in the coffin
it is dark here under ground it is not evil or pain here it is
blank here for reason

(it seem to me that everi thing in the light and air ought to be happi
whoever is not in hi coffin and the dark grave let him know he ha enough)

3
i see a beauti gigant swimmer swim nake through the eddi
of the sea
hi brown hair lie close and even to hi head he strike out with
courag arm he urg himself with hi leg
i see hi white bodi i see hi undaunt eye
i hate the swift-run eddi that would dash him head-foremost on
the rock

what are you do you ruffianli red-trickl waves?
will you kill the courag giant? will you kill him in the prime
of hi middl age?

steadi and long he struggl
he is baffl bangd bruisd he hold out while hi strength
hold out
the slap eddi are spot with hi blood they bear him away
they roll him swing him turn him
hi beauti bodi is born in the circl eddi it is
continu bruisd on rock
swiftli and ought of sight is born the brave corps

4
i turn but do not extric myself
confus a past-read anoth but with dark yet

the beach is cut by the razori ice-wind the wreck-gun sound
the tempest lull the moon come flounder through the drift

i look where the ship helplessli head end on i hear the burst as
she strike i hear the howl of dismay they grow fainter and fainter

i cannot aid with my wring finger
i can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freez upon me

i search with the crowd not one of the compani is washd to us aliv
in the morn i help pick up the dead and lay them in row in a barn

5
now of the older war-day the defeat at brooklyn

hill amid a crowd of offic
hi face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weep drop
he lift the glass perpetu to hi eye the color is blanchd

the same at last and at last when peac is declar

the chief encircl their neck with hi arm and kiss them on the cheek
he kiss lightli the wet cheek one after anoth he shake hand
and bid good-bi to the armi

now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner togeth
of when she wa a nearli grown girl live home with her parent on
the old homestead

a red squaw came one breakfast-tim to the old homestead
on her back she carri a bundl of rush for rush-bottom chair
her hair straight shini coars black profus half-envelopd
her face
her step wa free and elast and her voic sound exquisit as
she spoke

my mother lookd in delight and amaz at the stranger
she lookd at the fresh of her tall-born face and full and
pliant limb
the more she lookd upon her she love her
never befor had she seen such wonder beauti and puriti
she made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplac she cookd
food for her
she had no work to give her but she gave her remembr and fond

the red squaw staid all the forenoon and toward the middl of the
afternoon she went away
o my mother wa loth to have her go away
all the week she thought of her she watchd for her mani a month
she rememberd her mani a winter and mani a summer
but the red squaw never came nor wa heard of there again

7
a show of the summer softness--a contact of someth unseen--an
amour of the light and air

} to think of time

1
to think of time--of all that retrospect
to think of to-day and the age continu henceforward

have you guessd you yourself would not continue?
have you dread these earth-beetles?
have you feard the futur would be noth to you?

is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
if the futur is noth they are just as sure noth

to think that the sun rose in the east--that men and women were
flexibl real alive--that everi thing wa aliv
to think that you and i did not see feel think nor bear our part
to think that we are now here and bear our part

2
not a day pass not a minut or second without an accouch
not a day pass not a minut or second without a corps

the dull night go over and the dull day also
the sore of lie so much in bed goe over
the physician after long put off give the silent and terribl
look for an answer
the children come hurri and weep and the brother and sister
are sent for
medicin stand unus on the shelf (the camphor-smel ha long
pervad the rooms)
the faith hand of the live doe not desert the hand of the die
the twitch lip press lightli on the forehead of the die
the breath ceas and the puls of the heart ceas
the corps stretch on the bed and the live look upon it
it is palpabl as the live are palpabl

the live look upon the corps with their eyesight
but without eyesight linger a differ live and look curious
on the corps

3
to think the thought of death merg in the thought of materi
to think of all these wonder of citi and countri and other take
great interest in them and we take no interest in them

to think how eager we are in build our hous
to think other shall be just as eager and we quit indiffer

(i see one build the hous that serv him a few year or
seventi or eighti year at most
i see one build the hous that serv him longer than that)

slow-mov and black line creep over the whole earth--they never
cease--they are the burial line
he that wa presid wa buri and he that is now presid shall
sure be buri

a reminisc of the vulgar fate
a frequent sampl of the life and death of workmen
each after hi kind

cold dash of wave at the ferry-wharf posh and ice in the river
half-frozen mud in the street
a gray discourag sky overhead the short last daylight of decemb
a hears and stage the funer of an old broadway stage-driv
the corteg mostli driver

steadi the trot to the cemeteri duli rattl the death-bel
the gate is passd the new-dug grave is halt at the live
alight the hears unclos
the coffin is passd out lowerd and settl the whip is laid on
the coffin the earth is swiftli shoveld in
the mound abov is flat with the spades--sil
a minute--no one move or speaks--it is done
he is decent put away--i there ani thing more?

he wa a good fellow free-mouthd quick-temperd not bad-look
readi with life or death for a friend fond of women gambl ate
hearti drank hearti
had known what it wa to be flush grew low-spirit toward the
last sickend wa helpd by a contribut
die age forty-on years--and that wa hi funer

thumb extend finger uplift apron cape glove strap
wet-weath cloth whip care chosen
boss spotter starter hostler somebodi loaf on you you
loaf on somebodi headway man befor and man behind
good day work bad day work pet stock mean stock first out
last out turning-in at night
to think that these are so much and so nigh to other driver and he
there take no interest in them

5
the market the govern the working-man wage to think what
account they are through our night and day
to think that other working-men will make just as great account of
them yet we make littl or no account

the vulgar and the refin what you call sin and what you call
good to think how wide a differ
to think the differ will still continu to other yet we lie
beyond the differ

to think how much pleasur there is
do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engag in business? or
plan a nomin and election? or with your wife and family?
or with your mother and sisters? or in womanli housework? or the
beauti matern cares?
these also flow onward to other you and i flow onward
but in due time you and i shall take less interest in them

your farm profit crops--to think how engrossd you are
to think there will still be farm profit crop yet for you of
what avail?

6
what will be will be well for what is is well
to take interest is well and not to take interest shall be well

the domest joy the dalli housework or busi the build of
hous are not phantasm they have weight form locat
farm profit crop market wage govern are none of them
phantasm
the differ between sin and good is no delus
the earth is not an echo man and hi life and all the thing of hi
life are well-considerd

you are not thrown to the wind you gather certainli and safe
around yourself
yourself! yourself! yourself for ever and ever!

7
it is not to diffus you that you were born of your mother and
father it is to identifi you
it is not that you should be undecid but that you should be decid
someth long prepar and formless is arriv and formd in you
you are henceforth secur whatev come or goe

the thread that were spun are gatherd the wet cross the warp
the pattern is systemat

the prepar have everi one been justifi
the orchestra have suffici tune their instrument the baton
ha given the signal

the guest that wa come he wait long he is now hous
he is one of those who are beauti and happi he is one of those
that to look upon and be with is enough

the law of the past cannot be elud
the law of the present and futur cannot be elud
the law of the live cannot be elud it is etern
the law of promot and transform cannot be elud
the law of hero and good-doer cannot be elud
the law of drunkard inform mean person not one iota thereof
can be elud

8
slow move and black line go ceaselessli over the earth
northern goe carri and southern goe carri and they on the
atlant side and they on the pacif
and they between and all through the mississippi countri and all
over the earth

the great master and kosmo are well as they go the hero and
good-doer are well
the known leader and inventor and the rich owner and piou and
distinguishd may be well
but there is more account than that there is strict account of all

the intermin hord of the ignor and wick are not noth
the barbarian of africa and asia are not noth
the perpetu success of shallow peopl are not noth as they go

of and in all these thing
i have dreamd that we are not to be chang so much nor the law of
us chang
i have dreamd that hero and good-doer shall be under the present
and past law
and that murder drunkard liar shall be under the present and
past law
for i have dreamd that the law they are under now is enough

and i have dreamd that the purpos and essenc of the known life
the transient
is to form and decid ident for the unknown life the perman

if all came but to ash of dung
if maggot and rat end us then alarum! for we are betrayd
then inde suspicion of death

do you suspect death? if i were to suspect death i should die now
do you think i could walk pleasantli and well-suit toward annihilation?

pleasantli and well-suit i walk
whither i walk i cannot defin but i know it is good
the whole univers indic that it is good
the past and the present indic that it is good

how beauti and perfect are the animals!
how perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!
what is call good is perfect and what is call bad is just as perfect
the veget and miner are all perfect and the imponder
fluid perfect;
slowli and sure they have passd on to thi and slowli and sure
they yet pass on

9
i swear i think now that everi thing without except ha an etern soul!
the tree have root in the ground! the weed of the sea have! the
animals!

i swear i think there is noth but immortality!
that the exquisit scheme is for it and the nebul float is for
it and the coher is for it!
and all prepar is for it--and ident is for it--and life and
materi are altogeth for it!



[book xxx whisper of heavenli death]

} darest thou now o soul

darest thou now o soul
walk out with me toward the unknown region
where neither ground is for the feet nor ani path to follow?

no map there nor guid

i know it not o soul

all wait undreamd of in that region that inaccess land

i see just see skyward great cloud-mass
mourn slowli they roll silent swell and mix
with at time a half-dimmd saddend far-off star
appear and disappear

(some parturit rather some solemn immort birth;
on the frontier to eye impenetr
some soul is pass over)

of him i love day and night i dreamd i heard he wa dead
and i dreamd i went where they had buri him i love but he wa
not in that place
and i dreamd i wanderd search among burial-plac to find him
and i found that everi place wa a burial-place;
the hous full of life were equal full of death (thi hous is now)
the street the ship the place of amus the chicago
boston philadelphia the mannahatta were as full of the dead as
of the live
and fuller o vastli fuller of the dead than of the living;
and what i dreamd i will henceforth tell to everi person and age
and i stand henceforth bound to what i dreamd
and now i am will to disregard burial-plac and dispens with them
and if the memori of the dead were put up indiffer everywher
even in the room where i eat or sleep i should be satisfi
and if the corps of ani one i love or if my own corps be duli

i do not doubt that from under the feet and besid the hand and

i do not doubt but the majesti and beauti of the world are latent in
ani iota of the world
i do not doubt i am limitless and that the univers are limitless
in vain i tri to think how limitless
i do not doubt that the orb and the system of orb play their
swift sport through the air on purpos and that i shall one day
be elig to do as much as they and more than they
i do not doubt that temporari affair keep on and on million of year
i do not doubt interior have their interior and exterior have
their exterior and that the eyesight ha anoth eyesight and
the hear anoth hear and the voic anoth voic
i do not doubt that the passionately-wept death of young men are
provid for and that the death of young women and the
death of littl children are provid for
(did you think life wa so well provid for and death the purport
of all life is not well provid for?)
i do not doubt that wreck at sea no matter what the horror of
them no matter whose wife child husband father lover ha
gone down are provid for to the minutest point
i do not doubt that whatev can possibl happen anywher at ani
time is provid for in the inher of thing

measur myself by them

i henceforth no more ignor them than i ignor my own life
or the live of the earth arriv as far as mine or wait to arriv

o i see now that life cannot exhibit all to me as the day cannot

} thought

as i sit with other at a great feast suddenli while the music is play
to my mind (whenc it come i know not) spectral in mist of a
wreck at sea
of certain ship how they sail from port with fli streamer and
waft kiss and that is the last of them
of the solemn and murki mysteri about the fate of the presid
of the flower of the marin scienc of fifti gener founderd
off the northeast coast and go down--of the steamship arctic
go down
of the veild tableau-women gatherd togeth on deck pale heroic
wait the moment that draw so close--o the moment!

a huge sob--a few bubbles--th white foam spirt up--and then the
women gone
sink there while the passionless wet flow on--and i now
ponder are those women inde gone?
are soul drownd and destroyd so?
is onli matter triumphant?



} the last invoc

at the last tenderli
from the wall of the power fortressd hous
from the clasp of the knit lock from the keep of the well-clos door
let me be waft

let me glide noiselessli forth;
with the key of soft unlock the locks--with a whisper
set ope the door o soul

tenderly--b not impati

strong is your hold o love)

} face

1
saunter the pavement or ride the countri by-road faces!
face of friendship precis caution suaviti ideal
the spiritual-presci face the alway welcom common benevol face
the face of the sing of music the grand face of natur lawyer
and judg broad at the back-top
the face of hunter and fisher bulg at the brow the shave
blanchd face of orthodox citizen
the pure extravag yearn question artist face
the ugli face of some beauti soul the handsom detest or
despis face
the sacr face of infant the illumin face of the mother of
mani children
the face of an amour the face of vener
the face as of a dream the face of an immobil rock
the face withdrawn of it good and bad a castrat face
a wild hawk hi wing clippd by the clipper
a stallion that yield at last to the thong and knife of the gelder

saunter the pavement thu or cross the ceaseless ferri face
and face and face
i see them and complain not and am content with all

2
do you suppos i could be content with all if i thought them their
own finale?

thi now is too lament a face for a man
some abject lous ask leav to be cring for it
some milk-nos maggot bless what let it wrig to it hole

thi face is a dog snout snif for garbag
snake nest in that mouth i hear the sibil threat

thi face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea
it sleepi and wobbl iceberg crunch as they go

thi is a face of bitter herb thi an emet they need no label
and more of the drug-shelf laudanum caoutchouc or hogs-lard

thi face is an epilepsi it wordless tongu give out the unearthli cri
it vein down the neck distend it eye roll till they show
noth but their white
it teeth grit the palm of the hand are cut by the turnd-in nail
the man fall struggl and foam to the ground while he
specul well

thi face is bitten by vermin and worm
and thi is some murder knife with a half-pulld scabbard

thi face owe to the sexton hi dismalest fee
an unceas death-bel toll there

3
featur of my equal would you trick me with your creasd and
cadaver march?
well you cannot trick me

i see your round never-eras flow

splay and twist as you like poke with the tangl fore of fish or rat
youll be unmuzzl you certainli will

i saw the face of the most smeard and slobber idiot they had at
the asylum
and i knew for my consol what they knew not
i knew of the agent that empti and broke my brother
the same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement
and i shall look again in a score or two of age
and i shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharmd everi inch
as good as myself

4
the lord advanc and yet advanc
alway the shadow in front alway the reachd hand bring up the
laggard

out of thi face emerg banner and horses--o superb! i see what is come
i see the high pioneer-cap see stave of runner clear the way
i hear victori drum

thi face is a life-boat
thi is the face command and beard it ask no odd of the rest
thi face is flavord fruit readi for eat
thi face of a healthi honest boy is the programm of all good

these face bear testimoni slumber or awak
they show their descent from the master himself

off the word i have spoken i except not one--r white black are
all deific
in each hous is the ovum it come forth after a thousand year

spot or crack at the window do not disturb me
tall and suffici stand behind and make sign to me
i read the promis and patient wait

thi is a full-grown lili face
she speak to the limber-hippd man near the garden picket
come here she blushingli cri come nigh to me limber-hippd man
stand at my side till i lean as high as i can upon you
fill me with albesc honey bend down to me
rub to me with your chafe beard rub to my breast and shoulder

5
the old face of the mother of mani children
whist! i am fulli content

lulld and late is the smoke of the first-day morn
it hang low over the row of tree by the fenc
it hang thin by the sassafra and wild-cherri and cat-brier under them

i saw the rich ladi in full dress at the soire
i heard what the singer were sing so long
heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blu

behold a woman!
she look out from her quaker cap her face is clearer and more
beauti than the sky

she sit in an armchair under the shade porch of the farmhous
the sun just shine on her old white head

her ampl gown is of cream-hu linen
her grandson rais the flax and her grand-daught spun it with
the distaff and the wheel

the melodi charact of the earth
the finish beyond which philosophi cannot go and doe not wish to go
the justifi mother of men

love that is day and night--lov that is sun and moon and star
love that is crimson sumptuou sick with perfum

i see ship founder at sea i behold on deck and below deck the

7
o trumpet methink i am myself the instrument thou playest
thou meltst my heart my brain--thou movest drawest changest

and now thi sullen note send dark through me

and again the advanc of the armi

noiseless as mist and vapor
from their grave in the trench ascend
from cemeteri all through virginia and tennesse
from everi point of the compass out of the countless grave
in waft cloud in myriad larg or squad of two or three or
singl one they come
and silent gather round me

now sound no note o trumpet
not at the head of my cavalri parad on spirit hors
with sabr drawn and glisten and carbin by their thigh (ah
my brave horsemen!
my handsom tan-fac horsemen! what life what joy and pride
with all the peril were yours)

nor you drummer neither at reveil at dawn
nor the long roll alarm the camp nor even the muffl beat for burial
noth from you thi time o drummer bear my warlik drum

but asid from these and the mart of wealth and the crowd promenad
admit around me comrad close unseen by the rest and voiceless
the slain elat and aliv again the dust and debri aliv
i chant thi chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldier

face so pale with wondrou eye veri dear gather closer yet
draw close but speak not

phantom of countless lost
invis to the rest henceforth becom my companion
follow me ever--desert me not while i live

sweet are the bloom cheek of the living--sweet are the music
voic sound
but sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eye

dearest comrad all is over and long gone
but love is not over--and what love o comrades!
perfum from battle-field rise up from the foetor aris

perfum therefor my chant o love immort love
give me to bath the memori of all dead soldier
shroud them embalm them cover them all over with tender pride

perfum all--mak all wholesom
make these ash to nourish and blossom
o love solv all fructifi all with the last chemistri

give me exhaustless make me a fountain
that i exhal love from me wherev i go like a moist perenni dew

and inevit and they again lead to other results)

how the great citi appear--how the democrat mass turbul

how the whirl the contest the wrestl of evil with good the
sound and resound keep on and on
how societi wait unformd and is for a while between thing end
and thing begun
how america is the contin of glori and of the triumph of
freedom and of the democraci and of the fruit of societi and
of all that is begun
and how the state are complet in themselves--and how all triumph
and glori are complet in themselv to lead onward
and how these of mine and of the state will in their turn be

and how all peopl sight combin the democrat mass too
serve--and how everi fact and war itself with all it horror

and how now or at ani time each serv the exquisit transit of death

futur year
your mystic roll entir of unknown name or north or south
embalmd with love in thi twilight song



} when the full-grown poet came

when the full-grown poet came
out spake pleas natur (the round impass globe with all it
show of day and night) say he is mine;
but out spake too the soul of man proud jealou and unreconcil
nay he is mine alone;
--then the full-grown poet stood between the two and took each
by the hand;
and to-day and ever so stand as blender unit tightli hold hand
which he will never releas until he reconcil the two
and wholli and joyous blend them



} osceola

when hi hour for death had come
he slowli raisd himself from the bed on the floor
drew on hi war-dress shirt leg and girdl the belt around
hi waist
calld for vermilion paint (hi looking-glass wa held befor him)
paint half hi face and neck hi wrist and back-hand
put the scalp-knif care in hi belt--then lie down rest
moment
rose again half sit smile gave in silenc hi extend hand
to each and all
sank faintli low to the floor (tightli grasp the tomahawk handle)
fixd hi look on wife and littl children--th last:

(and here a line in memori of hi name and death)



} a voic from death

a voic from death solemn and strang in all hi sweep and power
with sudden indescrib blow--town drownd--human by
thousand slain
the vaunt work of thrift good dwell forg street iron bridg
dashd pell-mel by the blow--yet usherd life continu on
(amid the rest amid the rush whirl wild debri
a suffer woman saved--a babi safe born!)

although i come and unannouncd in horror and in pang
in pour flood and fire and wholesal element crash (thi
voic so solemn strange)
i too a minist of deiti

yea death we bow our face veil our eye to thee
we mourn the old the young untim drawn to thee
the fair the strong the good the capabl
the household wreckd the husband and the wife the engulf forger
in hi forg
the corps in the whelm water and the mud
the gatherd thousand to their funer mound and thousand never
found or gatherd

then after buri mourn the dead
(faith to them found or unfound forget not bear the
past here new musing)
a day--a pass moment or an hour--america itself bend low
silent resignd submiss

war death cataclysm like thi america
take deep to thi proud prosper heart

een as i chant lo! out of death and out of ooz and slime
the blossom rapidli bloom sympathi help love
from west and east from south and north and over sea
it hot-spurrd heart and hand human to human aid move on;
and from within a thought and lesson yet

thou ever-dart globe! through space and air!
thou water that encompass us!
thou that in all the life and death of us in action or in sleep!
thou law invis that permeat them and all
thou that in all and over all and through and under all incessant!
thou! thou! the vital univers giant forc resistless sleepless calm
hold human as in thi open hand as some ephemer toy
how ill to eer forget thee!

for i too have forgotten
(wrapt in these littl potenc of progress polit cultur
wealth invent civilization)
have lost my recognit of your silent ever-sway power ye
mighti element throe
in which and upon which we float and everi one of us is buoyd

for hi oerarch and last lesson the greybeard sufi
in the fresh scent of the morn in the open air
on the slope of a teem persian rose-garden
under an ancient chestnut-tre wide spread it branch
