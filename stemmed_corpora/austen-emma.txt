emma woodhous handsom clever and rich with a comfort home
and happi disposit seem to unit some of the best bless
of existence; and had live nearli twenty-on year in the world
with veri littl to distress or vex her

she wa the youngest of the two daughter of a most affection
indulg father; and had in consequ of her sister marriag
been mistress of hi hous from a veri earli period her mother
had die too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembr of her caresses; and her place had been suppli
by an excel woman as gover who had fallen littl short
of a mother in affect

sixteen year had miss taylor been in mr woodhous famili
less as a gover than a friend veri fond of both daughter
but particularli of emma between _them_ it wa more the intimaci
of sister even befor miss taylor had ceas to hold the nomin
offic of gover the mild of her temper had hardli allow
her to impos ani restraint; and the shadow of author be
now long pass away they had been live togeth as friend and
friend veri mutual attach and emma do just what she liked;
highli esteem miss taylor judgment but direct chiefli by
her own

the real evil inde of emma situat were the power of have
rather too much her own way and a disposit to think a littl
too well of herself; these were the disadvantag which threaten
alloy to her mani enjoy the danger howev wa at present
so unperceiv that they did not by ani mean rank as misfortun
with her

sorrow came--a gentl sorrow--but not at all in the shape of ani
disagre consciousness--miss taylor marri it wa miss
taylor loss which first brought grief it wa on the wedding-day
of thi belov friend that emma first sat in mourn thought
of ani continu the wed over and the bride-peopl gone
her father and herself were left to dine togeth with no prospect
of a third to cheer a long even her father compos himself
to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then onli to sit
and think of what she had lost

the event had everi promis of happi for her friend mr weston
wa a man of unexception charact easi fortun suitabl age
and pleasant manners; and there wa some satisfact in consid
with what self-deni gener friendship she had alway wish
and promot the match; but it wa a black morn work for her
the want of miss taylor would be felt everi hour of everi day
she recal her past kindness--th kind the affect of sixteen
years--how she had taught and how she had play with her from five
year old--how she had devot all her power to attach and amus
her in health--and how nurs her through the variou ill
of childhood a larg debt of gratitud wa owe here; but the
intercours of the last seven year the equal foot and perfect
unreserv which had soon follow isabella marriag on their
be left to each other wa yet a dearer tender recollect
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intellig
well-inform use gentl know all the way of the famili
interest in all it concern and peculiarli interest in herself
in everi pleasur everi scheme of hers--on to whom she could speak
everi thought as it aros and who had such an affect for her
as could never find fault

how wa she to bear the change?--it wa true that her friend wa
go onli half a mile from them; but emma wa awar that great must
be the differ between a mr weston onli half a mile from them
and a miss taylor in the house; and with all her advantag
natur and domest she wa now in great danger of suffer
from intellectu solitud she dearli love her father but he
wa no companion for her he could not meet her in convers
ration or play

the evil of the actual dispar in their age (and mr woodhous had
not marri early) wa much increas by hi constitut and habits;
for have been a valetudinarian all hi life without activ
of mind or bodi he wa a much older man in way than in years;
and though everywher belov for the friendli of hi heart
and hi amiabl temper hi talent could not have recommend him
at ani time

her sister though compar but littl remov by matrimoni
be settl in london onli sixteen mile off wa much beyond
her daili reach; and mani a long octob and novemb even must
be struggl through at hartfield befor christma brought the next
visit from isabella and her husband and their littl children
to fill the hous and give her pleasant societi again

highburi the larg and popul villag almost amount to a town
to which hartfield in spite of it separ lawn and shrubberi
and name did realli belong afford her no equal the woodhous
were first in consequ there all look up to them she had
mani acquaint in the place for her father wa univers civil
but not one among them who could be accept in lieu of miss
taylor for even half a day it wa a melancholi change; and emma
could not but sigh over it and wish for imposs thing
till her father awok and made it necessari to be cheer
hi spirit requir support he wa a nervou man easili depressed;
fond of everi bodi that he wa use to and hate to part with them;
hate chang of everi kind matrimoni as the origin of chang
wa alway disagreeable; and he wa by no mean yet reconcil
to hi own daughter marri nor could ever speak of her but
with compass though it had been entir a match of affect
when he wa now oblig to part with miss taylor too; and from
hi habit of gentl selfish and of be never abl to
suppos that other peopl could feel differ from himself
he wa veri much dispos to think miss taylor had done as sad
a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal
happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield
emma smile and chat as cheer as she could to keep him
from such thoughts; but when tea came it wa imposs for him
not to say exactli as he had said at dinner

poor miss taylor!--i wish she were here again what a piti it
is that mr weston ever thought of her!

i cannot agre with you papa; you know i cannot mr weston is such
a good-humour pleasant excel man that he thoroughli deserv
a good wife;--and you would not have had miss taylor live with us
for ever and bear all my odd humour when she might have a hous of her own?

a hous of her own!--but where is the advantag of a hous of her own?
thi is three time as large--and you have never ani odd humour
my dear

how often we shall be go to see them and they come to see
us!--w shall be alway meeting! _we_ must begin; we must go and pay
wed visit veri soon

my dear how am i to get so far? randal is such a distanc
i could not walk half so far

no papa nobodi thought of your walk we must go in the carriag
to be sure

the carriage! but jame will not like to put the hors to for
such a littl way;--and where are the poor hors to be while we
are pay our visit?

they are to be put into mr weston stabl papa you know we
have settl all that alreadi we talk it all over with mr weston
last night and as for jame you may be veri sure he will alway like
go to randal becaus of hi daughter be housemaid there
i onli doubt whether he will ever take us anywher els that wa
your do papa you got hannah that good place nobodi thought
of hannah till you mention her--jam is so oblig to you!

i am veri glad i did think of her it wa veri lucki for i would
not have had poor jame think himself slight upon ani account;
and i am sure she will make a veri good servant: she is a civil
pretty-spoken girl; i have a great opinion of her whenev i see her
she alway curtsey and ask me how i do in a veri pretti manner;
and when you have had her here to do needlework i observ she
alway turn the lock of the door the right way and never bang it
i am sure she will be an excel servant; and it will be a great
comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebodi about her that she is
use to see whenev jame goe over to see hi daughter you know
she will be hear of us he will be abl to tell her how we
all are

emma spare no exert to maintain thi happier flow of idea
and hope by the help of backgammon to get her father toler
through the even and be attack by no regret but her own
the backgammon-t wa placed; but a visitor immedi afterward
walk in and made it unnecessari

mr knightley a sensibl man about seven or eight-and-thirti wa not
onli a veri old and intim friend of the famili but particularli
connect with it as the elder brother of isabella husband
he live about a mile from highburi wa a frequent visitor
and alway welcom and at thi time more welcom than usual
as come directli from their mutual connexion in london he had
return to a late dinner after some day absenc and now walk
up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick squar
it wa a happi circumst and anim mr woodhous for some time
mr knightley had a cheer manner which alway did him good;
and hi mani inquiri after poor isabella and her children were
answer most satisfactorili when thi wa over mr woodhous
grate observ it is veri kind of you mr knightley to come
out at thi late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have
had a shock walk

not at all sir it is a beauti moonlight night; and so mild
that i must draw back from your great fire

but you must have found it veri damp and dirti i wish you may
not catch cold

dirti sir! look at my shoe not a speck on them

well! that is quit surpris for we have had a vast deal
of rain here it rain dread hard for half an hour
while we were at breakfast i want them to put off the wed

by the bye--i have not wish you joy be pretti well awar
of what sort of joy you must both be feel i have been in no hurri
with my congratulations; but i hope it all went off toler well
how did you all behave? who cri most?

ah! poor miss taylor! ti a sad busi

poor mr and miss woodhous if you please; but i cannot possibl
say `poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma;
but when it come to the question of depend or independence!--at
ani rate it must be better to have onli one to pleas than two

especi when _one_ of those two is such a fanci troublesom creature!
said emma play that is what you have in your head
i know--and what you would certainli say if my father were not by

i believ it is veri true my dear inde said mr woodhous
with a sigh i am afraid i am sometim veri fanci and troublesom

my dearest papa! you do not think i could mean _you_ or suppos
mr knightley to mean _you_ what a horribl idea! oh no! i meant
onli myself mr knightley love to find fault with me you know--
in a joke--it is all a joke we alway say what we like to one anoth

mr knightley in fact wa one of the few peopl who could see
fault in emma woodhous and the onli one who ever told her of them:
and though thi wa not particularli agreeabl to emma herself
she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would
not have him realli suspect such a circumst as her not be
thought perfect by everi bodi

emma know i never flatter her said mr knightley but i
meant no reflect on ani bodi miss taylor ha been use
to have two person to please; she will now have but one
the chanc are that she must be a gainer

well said emma will to let it pass--you want to hear
about the wedding; and i shall be happi to tell you for we all
behav charmingli everi bodi wa punctual everi bodi in their
best looks: not a tear and hardli a long face to be seen oh no;
we all felt that we were go to be onli half a mile apart
and were sure of meet everi day

dear emma bear everi thing so well said her father
but mr knightley she is realli veri sorri to lose poor miss taylor
and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she think for

emma turn away her head divid between tear and smile
it is imposs that emma should not miss such a companion
said mr knightley we should not like her so well as we do sir
if we could suppos it; but she know how much the marriag is to
miss taylor advantage; she know how veri accept it must be
at miss taylor time of life to be settl in a home of her own
and how import to her to be secur of a comfort provis
and therefor cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasur
everi friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happili
marri

and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma
and a veri consider one--that i made the match myself
i made the match you know four year ago; and to have it take place
and be prove in the right when so mani peopl said mr weston would
never marri again may comfort me for ani thing

mr knightley shook hi head at her her father fondli repli
ah! my dear i wish you would not make match and foretel thing
for whatev you say alway come to pass pray do not make ani
more match

i promis you to make none for myself papa; but i must inde
for other peopl it is the greatest amus in the world! and
after such success you know!--everi bodi said that mr weston would
never marri again oh dear no! mr weston who had been a widow
so long and who seem so perfectli comfort without a wife
so constantli occupi either in hi busi in town or among hi
friend here alway accept wherev he went alway cheerful--
mr weston need not spend a singl even in the year alon if he did
not like it oh no! mr weston certainli would never marri again
some peopl even talk of a promis to hi wife on her deathb
and other of the son and the uncl not let him all manner
of solemn nonsens wa talk on the subject but i believ none
of it

ever sinc the day--about four year ago--that miss taylor and i
met with him in broadway lane when becaus it began to drizzl
he dart away with so much gallantri and borrow two umbrella
for us from farmer mitchel i made up my mind on the subject
i plan the match from that hour; and when such success ha bless
me in thi instanc dear papa you cannot think that i shall leav
off match-mak

i do not understand what you mean by `success said mr knightley
success suppos endeavour your time ha been properli and
delic spent if you have been endeavour for the last four
year to bring about thi marriag a worthi employ for a young
ladi mind! but if which i rather imagin your make the match
as you call it mean onli your plan it your say to yourself
one idl day `i think it would be a veri good thing for miss taylor
if mr weston were to marri her and say it again to yourself
everi now and then afterward whi do you talk of success? where
is your merit? what are you proud of? you made a lucki guess;
and _that_ is all that can be said

and have you never known the pleasur and triumph of a lucki guess?--
i piti you--i thought you cleverer--for depend upon it a lucki
guess is never mere luck there is alway some talent in it
and as to my poor word `success which you quarrel with i do not
know that i am so entir without ani claim to it you have drawn
two pretti pictures; but i think there may be a third--a someth
between the do-noth and the do-al if i had not promot mr weston
visit here and given mani littl encourag and smooth
mani littl matter it might not have come to ani thing after all
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that

a straightforward open-heart man like weston and a ration
unaffect woman like miss taylor may be safe left to manag their
own concern you are more like to have done harm to yourself
than good to them by interfer

emma never think of herself if she can do good to other
rejoin mr woodhous understand but in part but my dear
pray do not make ani more matches; they are silli thing and break up
one famili circl grievous

onli one more papa; onli for mr elton poor mr elton! you
like mr elton papa--i must look about for a wife for him
there is nobodi in highburi who deserv him--and he ha been
here a whole year and ha fit up hi hous so comfort
that it would be a shame to have him singl ani longer--and i thought
when he wa join their hand to-day he look so veri much as if
he would like to have the same kind offic done for him! i think
veri well of mr elton and thi is the onli way i have of do
him a servic

mr elton is a veri pretti young man to be sure and a veri
good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you
want to shew him ani attent my dear ask him to come
and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing
i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him

with a great deal of pleasur sir at ani time said mr knightley
laugh and i agre with you entir that it will be a much
better thing invit him to dinner emma and help him to the best
of the fish and the chicken but leav him to chuse hi own wife
depend upon it a man of six or seven-and-twenti can take care
of himself



chapter ii


mr weston wa a nativ of highburi and born of a respect famili
which for the last two or three gener had been rise into
gentil and properti he had receiv a good educ but
on succeed earli in life to a small independ had becom
indispos for ani of the more home pursuit in which hi brother
were engag and had satisfi an activ cheer mind and social
temper by enter into the militia of hi counti then embodi

captain weston wa a gener favourite; and when the chanc
of hi militari life had introduc him to miss churchil
of a great yorkshir famili and miss churchil fell in love
with him nobodi wa surpriz except her brother and hi wife
who had never seen him and who were full of pride and import
which the connexion would offend

miss churchil howev be of age and with the full command
of her fortune--though her fortun bore no proport to the
family-estate--wa not to be dissuad from the marriag and it
took place to the infinit mortif of mr and mr churchil
who threw her off with due decorum it wa an unsuit connexion
and did not produc much happi mr weston ought to have found
more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper
made him think everi thing due to her in return for the great good
of be in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit
she had not the best she had resolut enough to pursu
her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain
from unreason regret at that brother unreason anger
nor from miss the luxuri of her former home they live beyond
their incom but still it wa noth in comparison of enscombe:
she did not ceas to love her husband but she want at onc
to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchil of enscomb

captain weston who had been consid especi by the churchil
as make such an amaz match wa prove to have much the worst
of the bargain; for when hi wife die after a three year marriag
he wa rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain
from the expens of the child howev he wa soon reliev
the boy had with the addit soften claim of a linger
ill of hi mother been the mean of a sort of reconciliation;
and mr and mr churchil have no children of their own
nor ani other young creatur of equal kindr to care for offer to
take the whole charg of the littl frank soon after her deceas
some scrupl and some reluct the widower-fath may be suppos
to have felt; but as they were overcom by other consider
the child wa given up to the care and the wealth of the churchil
and he had onli hi own comfort to seek and hi own situat to
improv as he could

a complet chang of life becam desir he quit the militia
and engag in trade have brother alreadi establish in a
good way in london which afford him a favour open
it wa a concern which brought just employ enough he had still
a small hous in highburi where most of hi leisur day were spent;
and between use occup and the pleasur of societi
the next eighteen or twenti year of hi life pass cheer away
he had by that time realis an easi competence--enough to secur
the purchas of a littl estat adjoin highburi which he had
alway long for--enough to marri a woman as portionless even
as miss taylor and to live accord to the wish of hi own
friendli and social disposit

it wa now some time sinc miss taylor had begun to influenc
hi schemes; but as it wa not the tyrann influenc of youth
on youth it had not shaken hi determin of never settl
till he could purchas randal and the sale of randal wa long
look forward to; but he had gone steadili on with these object
in view till they were accomplish he had made hi fortun
bought hi hous and obtain hi wife; and wa begin a new
period of exist with everi probabl of greater happi
than in ani yet pass through he had never been an unhappi man;
hi own temper had secur him from that even in hi first marriage;
but hi second must shew him how delight a well-judg and truli
amiabl woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof
of it be a great deal better to choos than to be chosen
to excit gratitud than to feel it

he had onli himself to pleas in hi choice: hi fortun wa
hi own; for as to frank it wa more than be tacitli brought
up as hi uncl heir it had becom so avow an adopt
as to have him assum the name of churchil on come of age
it wa most unlik therefor that he should ever want hi
father assist hi father had no apprehens of it
the aunt wa a caprici woman and govern her husband entirely;
but it wa not in mr weston natur to imagin that ani capric
could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believ
so deservedli dear he saw hi son everi year in london
and wa proud of him; and hi fond report of him as a veri fine
young man had made highburi feel a sort of pride in him too
he wa look on as suffici belong to the place to make hi
merit and prospect a kind of common concern

mr frank churchil wa one of the boast of highburi and a live
curios to see him prevail though the compliment wa so littl
return that he had never been there in hi life hi come
to visit hi father had been often talk of but never achiev

now upon hi father marriag it wa veri gener propos
as a most proper attent that the visit should take place
there wa not a dissenti voic on the subject either when
mr perri drank tea with mr and miss bate or when mr and
miss bate return the visit now wa the time for mr frank
churchil to come among them; and the hope strengthen when it wa
understood that he had written to hi new mother on the occas
for a few day everi morn visit in highburi includ some mention
of the handsom letter mr weston had receiv i suppos you
have heard of the handsom letter mr frank churchil ha written
to mr weston? i understand it wa a veri handsom letter inde
mr woodhous told me of it mr woodhous saw the letter and he
say he never saw such a handsom letter in hi life

it wa inde a highli prize letter mr weston had of cours
form a veri favour idea of the young man; and such a pleas
attent wa an irresist proof of hi great good sens
and a most welcom addit to everi sourc and everi express
of congratul which her marriag had alreadi secur she felt
herself a most fortun woman; and she had live long enough
to know how fortun she might well be thought where the onli
regret wa for a partial separ from friend whose friendship
for her had never cool and who could ill bear to part with her

she knew that at time she must be missed; and could not think
without pain of emma lose a singl pleasur or suffer
an hour ennui from the want of her companionableness: but dear
emma wa of no feebl character; she wa more equal to her situat
than most girl would have been and had sens and energi
and spirit that might be hope would bear her well and happili
through it littl difficulti and privat and then there wa
such comfort in the veri easi distanc of randal from hartfield
so conveni for even solitari femal walk and in mr weston
disposit and circumst which would make the approach
season no hindranc to their spend half the even in the
week togeth

her situat wa altogeth the subject of hour of gratitud
to mr weston and of moment onli of regret; and her
satisfaction--h more than satisfaction--h cheer enjoy
wa so just and so appar that emma well as she knew her father
wa sometim taken by surpriz at hi be still abl to piti
`poor miss taylor when they left her at randal in the centr
of everi domest comfort or saw her go away in the even
attend by her pleasant husband to a carriag of her own
but never did she go without mr woodhous give a gentl sigh
and say ah poor miss taylor! she would be veri glad to stay

there wa no recov miss taylor--nor much likelihood of
ceas to piti her; but a few week brought some allevi
to mr woodhous the compliment of hi neighbour were over;
he wa no longer teas by be wish joy of so sorrow an event;
and the wedding-cak which had been a great distress to him
wa all eat up hi own stomach could bear noth rich and he
could never believ other peopl to be differ from himself
what wa unwholesom to him he regard as unfit for ani body;
and he had therefor earnestli tri to dissuad them from have
ani wedding-cak at all and when that prove vain as earnestli
tri to prevent ani bodi eat it he had been at the pain
of consult mr perri the apothecari on the subject mr perri
wa an intellig gentlemanlik man whose frequent visit were one
of the comfort of mr woodhous life; and upon be appli to
he could not but acknowledg (though it seem rather against the
bia of inclination) that wedding-cak might certainli disagre
with many--perhap with most peopl unless taken moder
with such an opinion in confirm of hi own mr woodhous hope
to influenc everi visitor of the newli marri pair; but still the
cake wa eaten; and there wa no rest for hi benevol nerv till
it wa all gone

there wa a strang rumour in highburi of all the littl perri
be seen with a slice of mr weston wedding-cak in their
hands: but mr woodhous would never believ it



chapter iii


mr woodhous wa fond of societi in hi own way he like veri much
to have hi friend come and see him; and from variou unit caus
from hi long resid at hartfield and hi good natur
from hi fortun hi hous and hi daughter he could command the
visit of hi own littl circl in a great measur as he like
he had not much intercours with ani famili beyond that circle;
hi horror of late hour and larg dinner-parti made him unfit
for ani acquaint but such as would visit him on hi own term
fortun for him highburi includ randal in the same parish
and donwel abbey in the parish adjoin the seat of mr knightley
comprehend mani such not unfrequ through emma persuas
he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but even
parti were what he preferred; and unless he fanci himself at ani
time unequ to compani there wa scarc an even in the week
in which emma could not make up a card-tabl for him

real long-stand regard brought the weston and mr knightley;
and by mr elton a young man live alon without like it
the privileg of exchang ani vacant even of hi own blank solitud
for the eleg and societi of mr woodhous drawing-room
and the smile of hi love daughter wa in no danger of be
thrown away

after these came a second set; among the most come-at-
of whom were mr and miss bate and mr goddard three ladi
almost alway at the servic of an invit from hartfield
and who were fetch and carri home so often that mr woodhous
thought it no hardship for either jame or the hors had it
taken place onli onc a year it would have been a grievanc

mr bate the widow of a former vicar of highburi wa a
veri old ladi almost past everi thing but tea and quadril
she live with her singl daughter in a veri small way and wa
consid with all the regard and respect which a harmless old ladi
under such untoward circumst can excit her daughter enjoy
a most uncommon degre of popular for a woman neither young
handsom rich nor marri miss bate stood in the veri worst
predica in the world for have much of the public favour;
and she had no intellectu superior to make aton to herself
or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect
she had never boast either beauti or clever her youth
had pass without distinct and her middl of life wa devot
to the care of a fail mother and the endeavour to make a small
incom go as far as possibl and yet she wa a happi woman
and a woman whom no one name without good-wil it wa her own
univers good-wil and content temper which work such wonder
she love everi bodi wa interest in everi bodi happi
quicksight to everi bodi merits; thought herself a most fortun
creatur and surround with bless in such an excel mother
and so mani good neighbour and friend and a home that want
for noth the simplic and cheer of her natur
her content and grate spirit were a recommend to everi bodi
and a mine of felic to herself she wa a great talker upon
littl matter which exactli suit mr woodhous full of trivial
commun and harmless gossip

mr goddard wa the mistress of a school--not of a seminari
or an establish or ani thing which profess in long sentenc of
refin nonsens to combin liber acquir with eleg moral
upon new principl and new systems--and where young ladi for
enorm pay might be screw out of health and into vanity--but
a real honest old-fashion boarding-school where a reason
quantiti of accomplish were sold at a reason price
and where girl might be sent to be out of the way and scrambl
themselv into a littl educ without ani danger of come
back prodigi mr goddard school wa in high repute--and
veri deservedly; for highburi wa reckon a particularli healthi
spot: she had an ampl hous and garden gave the children plenti
of wholesom food let them run about a great deal in the summer
and in winter dress their chilblain with her own hand
it wa no wonder that a train of twenti young coupl now walk
after her to church she wa a plain motherli kind of woman
who had work hard in her youth and now thought herself entitl
to the occasion holiday of a tea-visit; and have formerli
owe much to mr woodhous kind felt hi particular claim
on her to leav her neat parlour hung round with fancy-work
whenev she could and win or lose a few sixpenc by hi firesid

these were the ladi whom emma found herself veri frequent
abl to collect; and happi wa she for her father sake
in the power; though as far as she wa herself concern
it wa no remedi for the absenc of mr weston she wa delight
to see her father look comfort and veri much pleas with
herself for contriv thing so well; but the quiet prose
of three such women made her feel that everi even so spent
wa inde one of the long even she had fear anticip

as she sat one morn look forward to exactli such a close
of the present day a note wa brought from mr goddard request
in most respect term to be allow to bring miss smith with her;
a most welcom request: for miss smith wa a girl of seventeen
whom emma knew veri well by sight and had long felt an interest in
on account of her beauti a veri graciou invit wa return
and the even no longer dread by the fair mistress of the mansion

harriet smith wa the natur daughter of somebodi somebodi had
place her sever year back at mr goddard school
and somebodi had late rais her from the condit of scholar
to that of parlour-board thi wa all that wa gener known
of her histori she had no visibl friend but what had been
acquir at highburi and wa now just return from a long visit
in the countri to some young ladi who had been at school there with her

she wa a veri pretti girl and her beauti happen to be of a sort
which emma particularli admir she wa short plump and fair
with a fine bloom blue eye light hair regular featur
and a look of great sweet and befor the end of the even
emma wa as much pleas with her manner as her person and quit
determin to continu the acquaint

she wa not struck by ani thing remark clever in miss smith
convers but she found her altogeth veri engaging--not
inconveni shi not unwil to talk--and yet so far from push
shew so proper and becom a defer seem so pleasantli
grate for be admit to hartfield and so artlessli
impress by the appear of everi thing in so superior a style
to what she had been use to that she must have good sens
and deserv encourag encourag should be given
those soft blue eye and all those natur grace should not be
wast on the inferior societi of highburi and it connexion
the acquaint she had alreadi form were unworthi of her
the friend from whom she had just part though veri good sort
of peopl must be do her harm they were a famili of the name
of martin whom emma well knew by charact as rent a larg farm
of mr knightley and resid in the parish of donwell--veri credit
she believed--sh knew mr knightley thought highli of them--but they
must be coars and unpolish and veri unfit to be the intim
of a girl who want onli a littl more knowledg and eleg
to be quit perfect _she_ would notic her; she would improv her;
she would detach her from her bad acquaint and introduc her
into good society; she would form her opinion and her manner
it would be an interest and certainli a veri kind undertaking;
highli becom her own situat in life her leisur and power

she wa so busi in admir those soft blue eye in talk
and listen and form all these scheme in the in-between that
the even flew away at a veri unusu rate; and the supper-t
which alway close such parti and for which she had been
use to sit and watch the due time wa all set out and readi
and move forward to the fire befor she wa awar with an
alacr beyond the common impuls of a spirit which yet wa never
indiffer to the credit of do everi thing well and attent
with the real good-wil of a mind delight with it own idea
did she then do all the honour of the meal and help and recommend
the minc chicken and scallop oyster with an urgenc which she
knew would be accept to the earli hour and civil scrupl of their guest

upon such occas poor mr woodhous feel were in sad warfar
he love to have the cloth laid becaus it had been the fashion
of hi youth but hi convict of supper be veri unwholesom
made him rather sorri to see ani thing put on it; and while hi
hospit would have welcom hi visitor to everi thing
hi care for their health made him griev that they would eat

such anoth small basin of thin gruel as hi own wa all that
he could with thorough self-approb recommend; though he
might constrain himself while the ladi were comfort clear
the nicer thing to say:

mr bate let me propos your ventur on one of these egg
an egg boil veri soft is not unwholesom serl understand boil
an egg better than ani bodi i would not recommend an egg boil
by ani bodi else; but you need not be afraid they are veri small
you see--on of our small egg will not hurt you miss bate
let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ littl bit
our are all apple-tart you need not be afraid of unwholesom
preserv here i do not advis the custard mr goddard what say
you to _half_ a glass of wine? a _small_ half-glass put into a tumbler
of water? i do not think it could disagre with you

emma allow her father to talk--but suppli her visitor in
a much more satisfactori style and on the present even had
particular pleasur in send them away happi the happi
of miss smith wa quit equal to her intent miss woodhous
wa so great a personag in highburi that the prospect of the
introduct had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humbl
grate littl girl went off with highli gratifi feel
delight with the affabl with which miss woodhous had treat
her all the even and actual shaken hand with her at last!



chapter iv


harriet smith intimaci at hartfield wa soon a settl thing
quick and decid in her way emma lost no time in invit encourag
and tell her to come veri often; and as their acquaint increas
so did their satisfact in each other as a walk companion
emma had veri earli foreseen how use she might find her
in that respect mr weston loss had been import her father
never went beyond the shrubberi where two divis of the ground
suffic him for hi long walk or hi short as the year varied;
and sinc mr weston marriag her exercis had been too much confin
she had ventur onc alon to randal but it wa not pleasant;
and a harriet smith therefor one whom she could summon at ani
time to a walk would be a valuabl addit to her privileg
but in everi respect as she saw more of her she approv her
and wa confirm in all her kind design

harriet certainli wa not clever but she had a sweet docil
grate disposit wa total free from conceit and onli desir
to be guid by ani one she look up to her earli attach
to herself wa veri amiable; and her inclin for good compani
and power of appreci what wa eleg and clever shew that
there wa no want of tast though strength of understand must
not be expect altogeth she wa quit convinc of harriet
smith be exactli the young friend she wanted--exactli the
someth which her home requir such a friend as mr weston
wa out of the question two such could never be grant
two such she did not want it wa quit a differ sort of thing
a sentiment distinct and independ mr weston wa the object
of a regard which had it basi in gratitud and esteem
harriet would be love as one to whom she could be use
for mr weston there wa noth to be done; for harriet everi thing

her first attempt at use were in an endeavour to find out who
were the parent but harriet could not tell she wa readi to tell
everi thing in her power but on thi subject question were vain
emma wa oblig to fanci what she liked--but she could never
believ that in the same situat _she_ should not have discov
the truth harriet had no penetr she had been satisfi
to hear and believ just what mr goddard chose to tell her;
and look no farther

mr goddard and the teacher and the girl and the affair of the
school in gener form natur a great part of the conversation--and
but for her acquaint with the martin of abbey-mil farm
it must have been the whole but the martin occupi her thought
a good deal; she had spent two veri happi month with them
and now love to talk of the pleasur of her visit and describ
the mani comfort and wonder of the place emma encourag her
talkativeness--amus by such a pictur of anoth set of be
and enjoy the youth simplic which could speak with so much
exult of mr martin have _two_ parlour two veri good parlour
indeed; one of them quit as larg as mr goddard drawing-room;
and of her have an upper maid who had live five-and-twenti year
with her; and of their have eight cow two of them alderney
and one a littl welch cow a veri pretti littl welch cow indeed;
and of mr martin say as she wa so fond of it it should be
call _her_ cow; and of their have a veri handsom summer-hous
in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink
tea:--a veri handsom summer-hous larg enough to hold a dozen peopl

for some time she wa amus without think beyond the immedi cause;
but as she came to understand the famili better other feel aros
she had taken up a wrong idea fanci it wa a mother and daughter
a son and son wife who all live together; but when it appear
that the mr martin who bore a part in the narr and wa alway
mention with approb for hi great good-natur in do someth
or other wa a singl man; that there wa no young mr martin
no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor littl
friend from all thi hospit and kind and that if she
were not taken care of she might be requir to sink herself forev

with thi inspirit notion her question increas in number
and meaning; and she particularli led harriet to talk more of mr martin
and there wa evid no dislik to it harriet wa veri readi
to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walk and merri
even games; and dwelt a good deal upon hi be so veri good-humour
and oblig he had gone three mile round one day in order to bring
her some walnut becaus she had said how fond she wa of them
and in everi thing els he wa so veri oblig he had hi
shepherd son into the parlour one night on purpos to sing to her
she wa veri fond of sing he could sing a littl himself
she believ he wa veri clever and understood everi thing
he had a veri fine flock and while she wa with them
he had been bid more for hi wool than ani bodi in the countri
she believ everi bodi spoke well of him hi mother and sister
were veri fond of him mr martin had told her one day (and there
wa a blush as she said it) that it wa imposs for ani bodi
to be a better son and therefor she wa sure whenev he marri
he would make a good husband not that she _wanted_ him to marri
she wa in no hurri at all

well done mr martin! thought emma you know what you are about

and when she had come away mr martin wa so veri kind as to send
mr goddard a beauti goose--th finest goos mr goddard had
ever seen mr goddard had dress it on a sunday and ask all
the three teacher miss nash and miss princ and miss richardson
to sup with her

mr martin i suppos is not a man of inform beyond the line
of hi own business? he doe not read?

oh yes!--that is no--i do not know--but i believ he ha
read a good deal--but not what you would think ani thing of
he read the agricultur report and some other book that lay
in one of the window seats--but he read all _them_ to himself
but sometim of an even befor we went to card he would read
someth aloud out of the eleg extract veri entertain
and i know he ha read the vicar of wakefield he never read the
romanc of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never
heard of such book befor i mention them but he is determin
to get them now as soon as ever he can

the next question was--

what sort of look man is mr martin?

oh! not handsome--not at all handsom i thought him veri plain
at first but i do not think him so plain now one doe not you know
after a time but did you never see him? he is in highburi everi
now and then and he is sure to ride through everi week in hi way
to kingston he ha pass you veri often

that may be and i may have seen him fifti time but without
have ani idea of hi name a young farmer whether on horseback
or on foot is the veri last sort of person to rais my curios
the yeomanri are precis the order of peopl with whom i feel i
can have noth to do a degre or two lower and a credit
appear might interest me; i might hope to be use to their
famili in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help
and is therefor in one sens as much abov my notic as in everi
other he is below it

to be sure oh yes! it is not like you should ever have
observ him; but he know you veri well indeed--i mean by sight

i have no doubt of hi be a veri respect young man
i know inde that he is so and as such wish him well
what do you imagin hi age to be?

he wa four-and-twenti the 8th of last june and my birthday is
the 23rd just a fortnight and a day difference--which is veri odd

onli four-and-twenti that is too young to settl hi mother is
perfectli right not to be in a hurri they seem veri comfort
as they are and if she were to take ani pain to marri him
she would probabl repent it six year henc if he could meet
with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as hi own
with a littl money it might be veri desir

six year hence! dear miss woodhous he would be thirti year old!

well and that is as earli as most men can afford to marri
who are not born to an independ mr martin i imagin
ha hi fortun entir to make--cannot be at all beforehand with
the world whatev money he might come into when hi father die
whatev hi share of the famili properti it is i dare say
all afloat all employ in hi stock and so forth; and though
with dilig and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to
imposs that he should have realis ani thing yet

to be sure so it is but they live veri comfort
they have no indoor man els they do not want for ani thing;
and mr martin talk of take a boy anoth year

i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenev he doe
marry;--i mean as to be acquaint with hi wife--for though
hi sister from a superior educ are not to be altogeth
object to it doe not follow that he might marri ani bodi at all fit
for you to notic the misfortun of your birth ought to make you
particularli care as to your associ there can be no doubt
of your be a gentleman daughter and you must support your
claim to that station by everi thing within your own power or there
will be plenti of peopl who would take pleasur in degrad you

ye to be sure i suppos there are but while i visit
at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhous
i am not afraid of what ani bodi can do

you understand the forc of influenc pretti well harriet; but i
would have you so firmli establish in good societi as to be
independ even of hartfield and miss woodhous i want to see you
perman well connect and to that end it will be advis
to have as few odd acquaint as may be; and therefor i say
that if you should still be in thi countri when mr martin marri
i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimaci with the sister
to be acquaint with the wife who will probabl be some mere
farmer daughter without educ

to be sure ye not that i think mr martin would ever marri ani bodi
but what had had some education--and been veri well brought up
howev i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and i
am sure i shall not wish for the acquaint of hi wife i shall
alway have a great regard for the miss martin especi elizabeth
and should be veri sorri to give them up for they are quit as well
educ as me but if he marri a veri ignor vulgar woman
certainli i had better not visit her if i can help it

emma watch her through the fluctuat of thi speech
and saw no alarm symptom of love the young man had been
the first admir but she trust there wa no other hold
and that there would be no seriou difficulti on harriet side
to oppos ani friendli arrang of her own

they met mr martin the veri next day as they were walk on the
donwel road he wa on foot and after look veri respect
at her look with most unfeign satisfact at her companion
emma wa not sorri to have such an opportun of survey;
and walk a few yard forward while they talk togeth soon made
her quick eye suffici acquaint with mr robert martin
hi appear wa veri neat and he look like a sensibl young man
but hi person had no other advantage; and when he came to be
contrast with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground
he had gain in harriet inclin harriet wa not insens
of manner; she had voluntarili notic her father gentl
with admir as well as wonder mr martin look as if he
did not know what manner wa

they remain but a few minut togeth as miss woodhous must
not be kept waiting; and harriet then came run to her with a
smile face and in a flutter of spirit which miss woodhous
hope veri soon to compos

onli think of our happen to meet him!--how veri odd! it wa
quit a chanc he said that he had not gone round by randal
he did not think we ever walk thi road he thought we walk
toward randal most day he ha not been abl to get the
romanc of the forest yet he wa so busi the last time he wa
at kingston that he quit forgot it but he goe again to-morrow
so veri odd we should happen to meet! well miss woodhous is he
like what you expected? what do you think of him? do you think him
so veri plain?

he is veri plain undoubtedly--remark plain:--but that is
noth compar with hi entir want of gentil i had no
right to expect much and i did not expect much; but i had no
idea that he could be so veri clownish so total without air
i had imagin him i confess a degre or two nearer gentil

to be sure said harriet in a mortifi voic he is not
so genteel as real gentlemen

i think harriet sinc your acquaint with us you have been
repeatedli in the compani of some such veri real gentlemen
that you must yourself be struck with the differ in mr martin
at hartfield you have had veri good specimen of well educ
well bred men i should be surpriz if after see them
you could be in compani with mr martin again without perceiv
him to be a veri inferior creature--and rather wonder at
yourself for have ever thought him at all agreeabl befor
do not you begin to feel that now? were not you struck? i am sure
you must have been struck by hi awkward look and abrupt manner
and the uncouth of a voic which i heard to be wholli unmodul
as i stood here

certainli he is not like mr knightley he ha not such a fine
air and way of walk as mr knightley i see the differ
plain enough but mr knightley is so veri fine a man!

mr knightley air is so remark good that it is not fair
to compar mr martin with _him_ you might not see one in a hundr
with _gentleman_ so plainli written as in mr knightley but he is
not the onli gentleman you have been late use to what say you
to mr weston and mr elton? compar mr martin with either of _them_
compar their manner of carri themselves; of walking; of speaking;
of be silent you must see the differ

oh yes!--ther is a great differ but mr weston is almost
an old man mr weston must be between forti and fifti

which make hi good manner the more valuabl the older a
person grow harriet the more import it is that their manner
should not be bad; the more glare and disgust ani loud
or coars or awkward becom what is passabl in youth
is detest in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt;
what will he be at mr weston time of life?

there is no say inde repli harriet rather solemnli

but there may be pretti good guess he will be a complet gross
vulgar farmer total inattent to appear and think
of noth but profit and loss

will he indeed? that will be veri bad

how much hi busi engross him alreadi is veri plain from the
circumst of hi forget to inquir for the book you recommend
he wa a great deal too full of the market to think of ani thing
else--which is just as it should be for a thrive man what ha
he to do with books? and i have no doubt that he _will_ thrive
and be a veri rich man in time--and hi be illiter and coars
need not disturb _us_

i wonder he did not rememb the book--wa all harriet answer
and spoken with a degre of grave displeasur which emma thought might
be safe left to itself she therefor said no more for some time
her next begin wa

in one respect perhap mr elton manner are superior
to mr knightley or mr weston they have more gentl
they might be more safe held up as a pattern there is an open
a quick almost a blunt in mr weston which everi bodi
like in _him_ becaus there is so much good-humour with it--but
that would not do to be copi neither would mr knightley
downright decid command sort of manner though it suit
_him_ veri well; hi figur and look and situat in life seem
to allow it; but if ani young man were to set about copi him
he would not be suffer on the contrari i think a young man
might be veri safe recommend to take mr elton as a model
mr elton is good-humour cheer oblig and gentl
he seem to me to be grown particularli gentl of late i do not
know whether he ha ani design of ingrati himself with either
of us harriet by addit soft but it strike me that hi
manner are softer than they use to be if he mean ani thing
it must be to pleas you did not i tell you what he said of you
the other day?

she then repeat some warm person prais which she had drawn
from mr elton and now did full justic to; and harriet blush
and smile and said she had alway thought mr elton veri agreeabl

mr elton wa the veri person fix on by emma for drive
the young farmer out of harriet head she thought it would
be an excel match; and onli too palpabl desir natur
and probabl for her to have much merit in plan it
she fear it wa what everi bodi els must think of and predict
it wa not like howev that ani bodi should have equal
her in the date of the plan as it had enter her brain dure
the veri first even of harriet come to hartfield the longer
she consid it the greater wa her sens of it expedi
mr elton situat wa most suitabl quit the gentleman himself
and without low connexions; at the same time not of ani famili
that could fairli object to the doubt birth of harriet he had a
comfort home for her and emma imagin a veri suffici income;
for though the vicarag of highburi wa not larg he wa known
to have some independ property; and she thought veri highli
of him as a good-humour well-mean respect young man
without ani defici of use understand or knowledg of the world

she had alreadi satisfi herself that he thought harriet a beauti
girl which she trust with such frequent meet at hartfield
wa foundat enough on hi side; and on harriet there could be
littl doubt that the idea of be prefer by him would have all
the usual weight and efficaci and he wa realli a veri pleas
young man a young man whom ani woman not fastidi might like
he wa reckon veri handsome; hi person much admir in gener
though not by her there be a want of eleg of featur which
she could not dispens with:--but the girl who could be gratifi
by a robert martin ride about the countri to get walnut
for her might veri well be conquer by mr elton admir



chapter v


i do not know what your opinion may be mr weston said mr knightley of
thi great intimaci between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing

a bad thing! do you realli think it a bad thing?--whi so?

i think they will neither of them do the other ani good

you surpriz me! emma must do harriet good: and by suppli her
with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good
i have been see their intimaci with the greatest pleasur
how veri differ we feel!--not think they will do each other ani
good! thi will certainli be the begin of one of our quarrel
about emma mr knightley

perhap you think i am come on purpos to quarrel with you
know weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battl

mr weston would undoubtedli support me if he were here
for he think exactli as i do on the subject we were speak
of it onli yesterday and agre how fortun it wa for emma
that there should be such a girl in highburi for her to associ with
mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judg in thi case
you are so much use to live alon that you do not know the valu
of a companion; and perhap no man can be a good judg of the comfort
a woman feel in the societi of one of her own sex after be use
to it all her life i can imagin your object to harriet smith
she is not the superior young woman which emma friend ought to be
but on the other hand as emma want to see her better inform
it will be an induc to her to read more herself they will
read togeth she mean it i know

emma ha been mean to read more ever sinc she wa twelv
year old i have seen a great mani list of her drawing-up at
variou time of book that she meant to read regularli through--and
veri good list they were--veri well chosen and veri neatli
arranged--sometim alphabet and sometim by some other rule
the list she drew up when onli fourteen--i rememb think it
did her judgment so much credit that i preserv it some time;
and i dare say she may have made out a veri good list now but i
have done with expect ani cours of steadi read from emma
she will never submit to ani thing requir industri and patienc
and a subject of the fanci to the understand where miss taylor
fail to stimul i may safe affirm that harriet smith will do
nothing--y never could persuad her to read half so much as you
wished--y know you could not

i dare say repli mr weston smile that i thought
so _then_;--but sinc we have part i can never rememb emma
omit to do ani thing i wish

there is hardli ani desir to refresh such a memori as _that_--said
mr knightley feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done but i
he soon ad who have had no such charm thrown over my sens
must still see hear and rememb emma is spoil by be the
cleverest of her famili at ten year old she had the misfortun of
be abl to answer question which puzzl her sister at seventeen
she wa alway quick and assured: isabella slow and diffid
and ever sinc she wa twelv emma ha been mistress of the hous
and of you all in her mother she lost the onli person abl to cope
with her she inherit her mother talent and must have been
under subject to her

i should have been sorri mr knightley to be depend on
_your_ recommend had i quit mr woodhous famili and want
anoth situation; i do not think you would have spoken a good word for
me to ani bodi i am sure you alway thought me unfit for the offic i held

ye said he smile you are better place _here_; veri fit
for a wife but not at all for a gover but you were prepar
yourself to be an excel wife all the time you were at hartfield
you might not give emma such a complet educ as your power would
seem to promise; but you were receiv a veri good educ from _her_
on the veri materi matrimoni point of submit your own will
and do as you were bid; and if weston had ask me to recommend
him a wife i should certainli have name miss taylor

thank you there will be veri littl merit in make a good wife
to such a man as mr weston

whi to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away
and that with everi disposit to bear there will be noth
to be born we will not despair howev weston may grow cross
from the wanton of comfort or hi son may plagu him

i hope not _that_--it is not like no mr knightley do not
foretel vexat from that quarter

not i inde i onli name possibl i do not pretend to emma
geniu for foretel and guess i hope with all my heart
the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchil in fortune--but
harriet smith--i have not half done about harriet smith i think
her the veri worst sort of companion that emma could possibl have
she know noth herself and look upon emma as know everi thing
she is a flatter in all her ways; and so much the wors
becaus undesign her ignor is hourli flatteri how can
emma imagin she ha ani thing to learn herself while harriet
is present such a delight inferiority? and as for harriet
i will ventur to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaint
hartfield will onli put her out of conceit with all the other place
she belong to she will grow just refin enough to be uncomfort
with those among whom birth and circumst have place her home
i am much mistaken if emma doctrin give ani strength of mind
or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself ration to the varieti
of her situat in life--they onli give a littl polish

i either depend more upon emma good sens than you do or am more
anxiou for her present comfort; for i cannot lament the acquaint
how well she look last night!

oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you?
veri well; i shall not attempt to deni emma be pretti

pretty! say beauti rather can you imagin ani thing nearer
perfect beauti than emma altogether--fac and figure?

i do not know what i could imagin but i confess that i have
seldom seen a face or figur more pleas to me than her
but i am a partial old friend

such an eye!--th true hazl eye--and so brilliant! regular featur
open counten with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health
and such a pretti height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
there is health not mere in her bloom but in her air her head
her glanc one hear sometim of a child be `the pictur
of health; now emma alway give me the idea of be the complet
pictur of grown-up health she is loveli itself mr knightley
is not she?

i have not a fault to find with her person he repli
i think her all you describ i love to look at her; and i
will add thi prais that i do not think her person vain
consid how veri handsom she is she appear to be littl
occupi with it; her vaniti lie anoth way mr weston i am
not to be talk out of my dislik of harriet smith or my dread
of it do them both harm

and i mr knightley am equal stout in my confid of it
not do them ani harm with all dear emma littl fault
she is an excel creatur where shall we see a better daughter
or a kinder sister or a truer friend? no no; she ha qualiti
which may be trusted; she will never lead ani one realli wrong;
she will make no last blunder; where emma err onc she is in the
right a hundr time

veri well; i will not plagu you ani more emma shall be an angel
and i will keep my spleen to myself till christma bring john
and isabella john love emma with a reason and therefor
not a blind affect and isabella alway think as he does;
except when he is not quit frighten enough about the children
i am sure of have their opinion with me

i know that you all love her realli too well to be unjust or unkind;
but excus me mr knightley if i take the liberti (i consid myself
you know as have somewhat of the privileg of speech that emma
mother might have had) the liberti of hint that i do not think
ani possibl good can aris from harriet smith intimaci be made
a matter of much discuss among you pray excus me; but suppos
ani littl inconveni may be apprehend from the intimaci
it cannot be expect that emma account to nobodi but her father
who perfectli approv the acquaint should put an end to it
so long as it is a sourc of pleasur to herself it ha been so
mani year my provinc to give advic that you cannot be surpriz
mr knightley at thi littl remain of offic

not at all cri he; i am much oblig to you for it
it is veri good advic and it shall have a better fate than your
advic ha often found; for it shall be attend to

mr john knightley is easili alarm and might be made unhappi
about her sister

be satisfi said he i will not rais ani outcri i will keep
my ill-humour to myself i have a veri sincer interest in emma
isabella doe not seem more my sister; ha never excit a
greater interest; perhap hardli so great there is an anxieti
a curios in what one feel for emma i wonder what will becom
of her!

so do i said mr weston gentli veri much

she alway declar she will never marri which of cours
mean just noth at all but i have no idea that she ha yet
ever seen a man she care for it would not be a bad thing for her
to be veri much in love with a proper object i should like to see
emma in love and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good
but there is nobodi hereabout to attach her; and she goe so seldom
from home

there doe inde seem as littl to tempt her to break
her resolut at present said mr weston as can well be;
and while she is so happi at hartfield i cannot wish her to be
form ani attach which would be creat such difficulti
on poor mr woodhous account i do not recommend matrimoni
at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assur you

part of her mean wa to conceal some favourit thought of
her own and mr weston on the subject as much as possibl
there were wish at randal respect emma destini but it
wa not desir to have them suspected; and the quiet transit
which mr knightley soon afterward made to what doe weston
think of the weather; shall we have rain? convinc her that he
had noth more to say or surmis about hartfield



chapter vi


emma could not feel a doubt of have given harriet fanci
a proper direct and rais the gratitud of her young vaniti
to a veri good purpos for she found her decidedli more sensibl
than befor of mr elton be a remark handsom man with most
agreeabl manners; and as she had no hesit in follow up
the assur of hi admir by agreeabl hint she wa soon
pretti confid of creat as much like on harriet side
as there could be ani occas for she wa quit convinc
of mr elton be in the fairest way of fall in love
if not in love alreadi she had no scrupl with regard to him
he talk of harriet and prais her so warmli that she could
not suppos ani thing want which a littl time would not add
hi percept of the strike improv of harriet manner
sinc her introduct at hartfield wa not one of the least
agreeabl proof of hi grow attach

you have given miss smith all that she requir said he;
you have made her grace and easi she wa a beauti creatur
when she came to you but in my opinion the attract you have
ad are infinit superior to what she receiv from natur

i am glad you think i have been use to her; but harriet
onli want draw out and receiv a few veri few hint
she had all the natur grace of sweet of temper and artless
in herself i have done veri littl

if it were admiss to contradict a ladi said the gallant
mr elton--

i have perhap given her a littl more decis of charact
have taught her to think on point which had not fallen in her
way befor

exactli so; that is what princip strike me so much superad
decis of character! skil ha been the hand!

great ha been the pleasur i am sure i never met with
a disposit more truli amiabl

i have no doubt of it and it wa spoken with a sort
of sigh anim which had a vast deal of the lover
she wa not less pleas anoth day with the manner
in which he second a sudden wish of her to have harriet pictur

did you ever have your like taken harriet? said she: did
you ever sit for your picture?

harriet wa on the point of leav the room and onli stopt to say
with a veri interest naivet

oh! dear no never

no sooner wa she out of sight than emma exclaim

what an exquisit possess a good pictur of her would be! i would
give ani money for it i almost long to attempt her like myself
you do not know it i dare say but two or three year ago i had
a great passion for take like and attempt sever of
my friend and wa thought to have a toler eye in gener
but from one caus or anoth i gave it up in disgust
but realli i could almost ventur if harriet would sit to me
it would be such a delight to have her picture!

let me entreat you cri mr elton; it would inde be a delight!
let me entreat you miss woodhous to exercis so charm a
talent in favour of your friend i know what your draw are
how could you suppos me ignorant? is not thi room rich in
specimen of your landscap and flowers; and ha not mr weston
some inimit figure-piec in her drawing-room at randalls?

ye good man!--thought emma--but what ha all that to do with take
likenesses? you know noth of draw dont pretend to be
in raptur about mine keep your raptur for harriet face
well if you give me such kind encourag mr elton i believ
i shall tri what i can do harriet featur are veri delic
which make a like difficult; and yet there is a peculiar
in the shape of the eye and the line about the mouth which one ought
to catch

exactli so--th shape of the eye and the line about the mouth--i
have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it
as you will do it it will inde to use your own word
be an exquisit possess

but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit
she think so littl of her own beauti did not you observ her
manner of answer me? how complet it meant `whi should my
pictur be drawn?

oh! ye i observ it i assur you it wa not lost on me
but still i cannot imagin she would not be persuad

harriet wa soon back again and the propos almost immedi made;
and she had no scrupl which could stand mani minut against the earnest
press of both the other emma wish to go to work directli
and therefor produc the portfolio contain her variou attempt
at portrait for not one of them had ever been finish that they
might decid togeth on the best size for harriet her mani
begin were display miniatur half-length whole-length
pencil crayon and water-colour had been all tri in turn
she had alway want to do everi thing and had made more progress
both in draw and music than mani might have done with so littl
labour as she would ever submit to she play and sang;--and drew
in almost everi style; but steadi had alway been wanting;
and in noth had she approach the degre of excel which she
would have been glad to command and ought not to have fail of
she wa not much deceiv as to her own skill either as an artist
or a musician but she wa not unwil to have other deceiv
or sorri to know her reput for accomplish often higher
than it deserv

there wa merit in everi drawing--in the least finish perhap the most;
her style wa spirited; but had there been much less or had there
been ten time more the delight and admir of her two companion
would have been the same they were both in ecstasi a like
pleas everi body; and miss woodhous perform must be capit

no great varieti of face for you said emma i had onli my
own famili to studi from there is my father--anoth of my
father--but the idea of sit for hi pictur made him so nervou
that i could onli take him by stealth; neither of them veri
like therefor mr weston again and again and again you see
dear mr weston! alway my kindest friend on everi occas
she would sit whenev i ask her there is my sister; and realli
quit her own littl eleg figure!--and the face not unlik
i should have made a good like of her if she would have
sat longer but she wa in such a hurri to have me draw her four
children that she would not be quiet then here come all my
attempt at three of those four children;--ther they are
henri and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other
and ani one of them might do for ani one of the rest she wa so
eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse; but there is no
make children of three or four year old stand still you know;
nor can it be veri easi to take ani like of them beyond the
air and complexion unless they are coarser featur than ani
of mama children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth
who wa a babi i took him as he wa sleep on the sofa and it
is as strong a like of hi cockad as you would wish to see
he had nestl down hi head most conveni that veri like
i am rather proud of littl georg the corner of the sofa is veri good
then here is my last--unclos a pretti sketch of a gentleman
in small size whole-length--mi last and my best--mi brother
mr john knightley--thi did not want much of be finish when i
put it away in a pet and vow i would never take anoth like
i could not help be provoked; for after all my pain and when i
had realli made a veri good like of it--(mr weston and i
were quit agre in think it _very_ like)--onli too handsome--too
flattering--but that wa a fault on the right side--aft
all thi came poor dear isabella cold approb of--y
it wa a littl like--but to be sure it did not do him justic
we had had a great deal of troubl in persuad him to sit at all
it wa made a great favour of; and altogeth it wa more than i
could bear; and so i never would finish it to have it apologis
over as an unfavour like to everi morn visitor in
brunswick square;--and as i said i did then forswear ever draw
ani bodi again but for harriet sake or rather for my own
and as there are no husband and wive in the case _at_ _present_
i will break my resolut now

mr elton seem veri properli struck and delight by the idea
and wa repeat no husband and wive in the case at present
inde as you observ exactli so no husband and wive
with so interest a conscious that emma began to consid
whether she had not better leav them togeth at onc but as she
want to be draw the declar must wait a littl longer

she had soon fix on the size and sort of portrait
it wa to be a whole-length in water-colour like mr john
knightley and wa destin if she could pleas herself
to hold a veri honour station over the mantelpiec

the sit began; and harriet smile and blush and afraid
of not keep her attitud and counten present a veri sweet
mixtur of youth express to the steadi eye of the artist
but there wa no do ani thing with mr elton fidget behind
her and watch everi touch she gave him credit for station
himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;
but wa realli oblig to put an end to it and request him to
place himself elsewher it then occur to her to employ him
in read

if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kind
indeed! it would amus away the difficulti of her part and lessen
the irksom of miss smith

mr elton wa onli too happi harriet listen and emma drew
in peac she must allow him to be still frequent come to look;
ani thing less would certainli have been too littl in a lover;
and he wa readi at the smallest intermiss of the pencil
to jump up and see the progress and be charmed--ther wa no
be displeas with such an encourag for hi admir
made him discern a like almost befor it wa possibl
she could not respect hi eye but hi love and hi complais
were unexception

the sit wa altogeth veri satisfactory; she wa quit
enough pleas with the first day sketch to wish to go on
there wa no want of like she had been fortun in the attitud
and as she meant to throw in a littl improv to the figur
to give a littl more height and consider more eleg she had
great confid of it be in everi way a pretti draw at last
and of it fill it destin place with credit to them both--a
stand memori of the beauti of one the skill of the other
and the friendship of both; with as mani other agreeabl associ
as mr elton veri promis attach wa like to add

harriet wa to sit again the next day; and mr elton just as he ought
entreat for the permiss of attend and read to them again

by all mean we shall be most happi to consid you as one
of the parti

the same civil and courtesi the same success and satisfact
took place on the morrow and accompani the whole progress
of the pictur which wa rapid and happi everi bodi who saw it
wa pleas but mr elton wa in continu raptur and defend
it through everi critic

miss woodhous ha given her friend the onli beauti she
wanted--observ mr weston to him--not in the least suspect
that she wa address a lover--th express of the eye is
most correct but miss smith ha not those eyebrow and eyelash
it is the fault of her face that she ha them not

do you think so? repli he i cannot agre with you
it appear to me a most perfect resembl in everi featur
i never saw such a like in my life we must allow for the effect
of shade you know

you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley

emma knew that she had but would not own it; and mr elton warmli ad

oh no! certainli not too tall; not in the least too tall consid
she is sit down--which natur present a different--which
in short give exactli the idea--and the proport must
be preserv you know proport fore-shortening--oh no! it
give one exactli the idea of such a height as miss smith exactli so indeed!

it is veri pretti said mr woodhous so prettili done! just
as your draw alway are my dear i do not know ani bodi who draw
so well as you do the onli thing i do not thoroughli like is
that she seem to be sit out of door with onli a littl shawl
over her shoulders--and it make one think she must catch cold

but my dear papa it is suppos to be summer; a warm day in summer
look at the tree

but it is never safe to sit out of door my dear

you sir may say ani thing cri mr elton but i must confess
that i regard it as a most happi thought the place of miss
smith out of doors; and the tree is touch with such inimit
spirit! ani other situat would have been much less in charact
the naivet of miss smith manners--and altogether--oh it is
most admirable! i cannot keep my eye from it i never saw such
a like

the next thing want wa to get the pictur framed; and here were a
few difficulti it must be done directly; it must be done in london;
the order must go through the hand of some intellig person whose tast
could be depend on; and isabella the usual doer of all commiss
must not be appli to becaus it wa decemb and mr woodhous
could not bear the idea of her stir out of her hous in the fog
of decemb but no sooner wa the distress known to mr elton
than it wa remov hi gallantri wa alway on the alert
might he be trust with the commiss what infinit pleasur
should he have in execut it! he could ride to london at ani time
it wa imposs to say how much he should be gratifi by be
employ on such an errand

he wa too good!--sh could not endur the thought!--sh would
not give him such a troublesom offic for the world--brought
on the desir repetit of entreati and assurances--and
a veri few minut settl the busi

mr elton wa to take the draw to london chuse the frame
and give the directions; and emma thought she could so pack it
as to ensur it safeti without much incommod him while he
seem mostli fear of not be incommod enough

what a preciou deposit! said he with a tender sigh as he
receiv it

thi man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma
i should say so but that i suppos there may be a hundr differ
way of be in love he is an excel young man and will suit
harriet exactly; it will be an `exactli so as he say himself;
but he doe sigh and languish and studi for compliment rather more
than i could endur as a princip i come in for a pretti good
share as a second but it is hi gratitud on harriet account



chapter vii


the veri day of mr elton go to london produc a fresh occas
for emma servic toward her friend harriet had been at hartfield
as usual soon after breakfast; and after a time had gone home
to return again to dinner: she return and sooner than had been
talk of and with an agit hurri look announc someth
extraordinari to have happen which she wa long to tell
half a minut brought it all out she had heard as soon as she got
back to mr goddard that mr martin had been there an hour befor
and find she wa not at home nor particularli expect had left
a littl parcel for her from one of hi sister and gone away;
and on open thi parcel she had actual found besid the two
song which she had lent elizabeth to copi a letter to herself;
and thi letter wa from him from mr martin and contain a direct
propos of marriag who could have thought it? she wa so surpriz
she did not know what to do ye quit a propos of marriage;
and a veri good letter at least she thought so and he wrote
as if he realli love her veri much--but she did not know--and so
she wa come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhous what she
should do-- emma wa half-asham of her friend for seem so
pleas and so doubt

upon my word she cri the young man is determin not to lose
ani thing for want of ask he will connect himself well if he can

will you read the letter? cri harriet pray do id rather
you would

emma wa not sorri to be press she read and wa surpriz
the style of the letter wa much abov her expect
there were not mere no grammat error but as a composit it
would not have disgrac a gentleman; the languag though plain
wa strong and unaffect and the sentiment it convey veri much
to the credit of the writer it wa short but express good sens
warm attach liber proprieti even delicaci of feel
she paus over it while harriet stood anxious watch for
her opinion with a well well and wa at last forc to add
is it a good letter? or is it too short?

ye inde a veri good letter repli emma rather slowly--so
good a letter harriet that everi thing consid i think one of
hi sister must have help him i can hardli imagin the young
man whom i saw talk with you the other day could express himself
so well if left quit to hi own power and yet it is not the
style of a woman; no certainli it is too strong and concise;
not diffus enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensibl man
and i suppos may have a natur talent for--think strongli and
clearly--and when he take a pen in hand hi thought natur find
proper word it is so with some men ye i understand the sort
of mind vigor decid with sentiment to a certain point
not coars a better written letter harriet (return it)
than i had expect

well said the still wait harriet;--well--and--and what
shall i do?

what shall you do! in what respect? do you mean with regard
to thi letter?

ye

but what are you in doubt of? you must answer it of course--and speedili

ye but what shall i say? dear miss woodhous do advis me

oh no no! the letter had much better be all your own you will
express yourself veri properli i am sure there is no danger of your
not be intellig which is the first thing your mean must
be unequivocal; no doubt or demurs: and such express of gratitud
and concern for the pain you are inflict as proprieti requir
will present themselv unbidden to _your_ mind i am persuad
you need not be prompt to write with the appear of sorrow
for hi disappoint

you think i ought to refus him then said harriet look down

ought to refus him! my dear harriet what do you mean? are you
in ani doubt as to that? i thought--but i beg your pardon perhap i
have been under a mistak i certainli have been misunderstand
you if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer
i had imagin you were consult me onli as to the word of it

harriet wa silent with a littl reserv of manner emma continued:

you mean to return a favour answer i collect

no i do not; that is i do not mean--what shall i do? what would
you advis me to do? pray dear miss woodhous tell me what i
ought to do

i shall not give you ani advic harriet i will have noth to
do with it thi is a point which you must settl with your feel

i had no notion that he like me so veri much said harriet
contempl the letter for a littl while emma persev
in her silence; but begin to apprehend the bewitch flatteri
of that letter might be too power she thought it best to say

i lay it down as a gener rule harriet that if a woman _doubts_
as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainli ought
to refus him if she can hesit as to `ye she ought to say
`no directli it is not a state to be safe enter into
with doubt feel with half a heart i thought it my duti
as a friend and older than yourself to say thu much to you
but do not imagin that i want to influenc you

oh! no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you
would just advis me what i had best do--no no i do not mean
that--a you say one mind ought to be quit made up--on should
not be hesitating--it is a veri seriou thing--it will be safer
to say `no perhaps--do you think i had better say `no?

not for the world said emma smile gracious would i advis
you either way you must be the best judg of your own happi
if you prefer mr martin to everi other person; if you think him
the most agreeabl man you have ever been in compani with whi should
you hesitate? you blush harriet--do ani bodi els occur to you
at thi moment under such a definition? harriet harriet do not
deceiv yourself; do not be run away with by gratitud and compass
at thi moment whom are you think of?

the symptom were favourable--instead of answer harriet turn
away confus and stood thought by the fire; and though
the letter wa still in her hand it wa now mechan twist
about without regard emma wait the result with impati
but not without strong hope at last with some hesit
harriet said--

miss woodhous as you will not give me your opinion i must
do as well as i can by myself; and i have now quit determin
and realli almost made up my mind--to refus mr martin do you
think i am right?

perfectli perfectli right my dearest harriet; you are do just
what you ought while you were at all in suspens i kept my feel
to myself but now that you are so complet decid i have no
hesit in approv dear harriet i give myself joy of thi
it would have griev me to lose your acquaint which must have
been the consequ of your marri mr martin while you were in
the smallest degre waver i said noth about it becaus i would
not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me
i could not have visit mr robert martin of abbey-mil farm
now i am secur of you for ever

harriet had not surmis her own danger but the idea of it struck
her forcibl

you could not have visit me! she cri look aghast
no to be sure you could not; but i never thought of that befor
that would have been too dreadful!--what an escape!--dear miss woodhous
i would not give up the pleasur and honour of be intim with you
for ani thing in the world

inde harriet it would have been a sever pang to lose you;
but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all
good societi i must have given you up

dear me!--how should i ever have born it! it would have kill
me never to come to hartfield ani more!

dear affection creature!--_you_ banish to abbey-mil farm!--_you_
confin to the societi of the illiter and vulgar all your life!
i wonder how the young man could have the assur to ask it
he must have a pretti good opinion of himself

i do not think he is conceit either in gener said harriet
her conscienc oppos such censure; at least he is veri good natur
and i shall alway feel much oblig to him and have a great regard
for--but that is quit a differ thing from--and you know
though he may like me it doe not follow that i should--and
certainli i must confess that sinc my visit here i have seen
people--and if one come to compar them person and manner
there is no comparison at all _one_ is so veri handsom and agreeabl
howev i do realli think mr martin a veri amiabl young man
and have a great opinion of him; and hi be so much attach
to me--and hi write such a letter--but as to leav you
it is what i would not do upon ani consider

thank you thank you my own sweet littl friend we will not
be part a woman is not to marri a man mere becaus she is ask
or becaus he is attach to her and can write a toler letter

oh no;--and it is but a short letter too

emma felt the bad tast of her friend but let it pass with a
veri true; and it would be a small consol to her for the
clownish manner which might be offend her everi hour of the day
to know that her husband could write a good letter

oh! ye veri nobodi care for a letter; the thing is to be alway
happi with pleasant companion i am quit determin to refus him
but how shall i do? what shall i say?

emma assur her there would be no difficulti in the answer
and advis it be written directli which wa agre to
in the hope of her assistance; and though emma continu to protest
against ani assist be want it wa in fact given in the
format of everi sentenc the look over hi letter again
in repli to it had such a soften tendenc that it wa
particularli necessari to brace her up with a few decis expressions;
and she wa so veri much concern at the idea of make him unhappi
and thought so much of what hi mother and sister would think and say
and wa so anxiou that they should not fanci her ungrat
that emma believ if the young man had come in her way at that moment
he would have been accept after all

thi letter howev wa written and seal and sent
the busi wa finish and harriet safe she wa rather low
all the even but emma could allow for her amiabl regret
and sometim reliev them by speak of her own affect
sometim by bring forward the idea of mr elton

i shall never be invit to abbey-mil again wa said in rather
a sorrow tone

nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet
you are a great deal too necessari at hartfield to be spare
to abbey-mil

and i am sure i should never want to go there; for i am never happi
but at hartfield

some time afterward it wa i think mr goddard would be veri
much surpriz if she knew what had happen i am sure miss nash
would--for miss nash think her own sister veri well marri
and it is onli a linen-drap

one should be sorri to see greater pride or refin in the
teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envi you
such an opportun as thi of be marri even thi conquest
would appear valuabl in her eye as to ani thing superior for you
i suppos she is quit in the dark the attent of a certain
person can hardli be among the tittle-tattl of highburi yet
hitherto i fanci you and i are the onli peopl to whom hi look
and manner have explain themselv

harriet blush and smile and said someth about wonder
that peopl should like her so much the idea of mr elton wa
certainli cheering; but still after a time she wa tender-heart
again toward the reject mr martin

now he ha got my letter said she softli i wonder what they
are all doing--wheth hi sister know--if he is unhappi
they will be unhappi too i hope he will not mind it so veri much

let us think of those among our absent friend who are more
cheer employ cri emma at thi moment perhap mr elton
is shew your pictur to hi mother and sister tell how much
more beauti is the origin and after be ask for it five
or six time allow them to hear your name your own dear name

my picture!--but he ha left my pictur in bond-street

ha he so!--then i know noth of mr elton no my dear
littl modest harriet depend upon it the pictur will not be
in bond-street till just befor he mount hi hors to-morrow
it is hi companion all thi even hi solac hi delight
it open hi design to hi famili it introduc you among them
it diffus through the parti those pleasantest feel of our natur
eager curios and warm prepossess how cheer how anim
how suspici how busi their imagin all are!

harriet smile again and her smile grew stronger



chapter viii


harriet slept at hartfield that night for some week past she
had been spend more than half her time there and gradual
get to have a bed-room appropri to herself; and emma
judg it best in everi respect safest and kindest to keep her
with them as much as possibl just at present she wa oblig
to go the next morn for an hour or two to mr goddard
but it wa then to be settl that she should return to hartfield
to make a regular visit of some day

while she wa gone mr knightley call and sat some time with
mr woodhous and emma till mr woodhous who had previous made up
hi mind to walk out wa persuad by hi daughter not to defer it
and wa induc by the entreati of both though against the scrupl
of hi own civil to leav mr knightley for that purpos
mr knightley who had noth of ceremoni about him wa offer
by hi short decid answer an amus contrast to the protract
apolog and civil hesit of the other

well i believ if you will excus me mr knightley if you
will not consid me as do a veri rude thing i shall take
emma advic and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun
is out i believ i had better take my three turn while i can
i treat you without ceremoni mr knightley we invalid think we
are privileg peopl

my dear sir do not make a stranger of me

i leav an excel substitut in my daughter emma will be happi
to entertain you and therefor i think i will beg your excus
and take my three turns--mi winter walk

you cannot do better sir

i would ask for the pleasur of your compani mr knightley
but i am a veri slow walker and my pace would be tediou to you;
and besid you have anoth long walk befor you to donwel abbey

thank you sir thank you; i am go thi moment myself; and i
think the sooner _you_ go the better i will fetch your greatcoat
and open the garden door for you

mr woodhous at last wa off; but mr knightley instead of be
immedi off likewis sat down again seemingli inclin
for more chat he began speak of harriet and speak
of her with more voluntari prais than emma had ever heard befor

i cannot rate her beauti as you do said he; but she is a
pretti littl creatur and i am inclin to think veri well of
her disposit her charact depend upon those she is with;
but in good hand she will turn out a valuabl woman

i am glad you think so; and the good hand i hope may not be want

come said he you are anxiou for a compliment so i will
tell you that you have improv her you have cure her of her
school-girl giggle; she realli doe you credit

thank you i should be mortifi inde if i did not believ i
had been of some use; but it is not everi bodi who will bestow
prais where they may _you_ do not often overpow me with it

you are expect her again you say thi morning?

almost everi moment she ha been gone longer alreadi than
she intend

someth ha happen to delay her; some visitor perhap

highburi gossips!--tiresom wretches!

harriet may not consid everi bodi tiresom that you would

emma knew thi wa too true for contradict and therefor
said noth he present ad with a smile

i do not pretend to fix on time or place but i must tell you
that i have good reason to believ your littl friend will soon
hear of someth to her advantag

indeed! how so? of what sort?

a veri seriou sort i assur you; still smile

veri serious! i can think of but one thing--who is in love
with her? who make you their confidant?

emma wa more than half in hope of mr elton have dropt a hint
mr knightley wa a sort of gener friend and advis and she knew
mr elton look up to him

i have reason to think he repli that harriet smith will
soon have an offer of marriag and from a most unexception
quarter:--robert martin is the man her visit to abbey-mil
thi summer seem to have done hi busi he is desper
in love and mean to marri her

he is veri oblig said emma; but is he sure that harriet
mean to marri him?

well well mean to make her an offer then will that do? he came
to the abbey two even ago on purpos to consult me about it
he know i have a thorough regard for him and all hi famili and
i believ consid me as one of hi best friend he came to ask
me whether i thought it would be imprud in him to settl so early;
whether i thought her too young: in short whether i approv hi
choic altogether; have some apprehens perhap of her be
consid (especi sinc _your_ make so much of her) as in a line
of societi abov him i wa veri much pleas with all that he said
i never hear better sens from ani one than robert martin
he alway speak to the purpose; open straightforward and veri
well judg he told me everi thing; hi circumst and plan
and what they all propos do in the event of hi marriag he is
an excel young man both as son and brother i had no hesit
in advis him to marri he prove to me that he could afford it;
and that be the case i wa convinc he could not do better
i prais the fair ladi too and altogeth sent him away veri happi
if he had never esteem my opinion befor he would have thought
highli of me then; and i dare say left the hous think me the
best friend and counsellor man ever had thi happen the night
befor last now as we may fairli suppos he would not allow
much time to pass befor he spoke to the ladi and as he doe not
appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlik that he should
be at mr goddard to-day; and she may be detain by a visitor
without think him at all a tiresom wretch

pray mr knightley said emma who had been smile to herself
through a great part of thi speech how do you know that mr martin
did not speak yesterday?

certainli repli he surpriz i do not absolut know it;
but it may be infer wa not she the whole day with you?

come said she i will tell you someth in return for what
you have told me he did speak yesterday--that is he wrote
and wa refus

thi wa oblig to be repeat befor it could be believed;
and mr knightley actual look red with surpriz and displeasur
as he stood up in tall indign and said

then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believ her
what is the foolish girl about?

oh! to be sure cri emma it is alway incomprehens
to a man that a woman should ever refus an offer of marriag
a man alway imagin a woman to be readi for ani bodi who ask her

nonsense! a man doe not imagin ani such thing but what is
the mean of this? harriet smith refus robert martin? mad
if it is so; but i hope you are mistaken

i saw her answer!--noth could be clearer

you saw her answer!--y wrote her answer too emma thi is
your do you persuad her to refus him

and if i did (which howev i am far from allowing) i should
not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a veri respect
young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet equal; and am
rather surpriz inde that he should have ventur to address her
by your account he doe seem to have had some scrupl it is
a piti that they were ever got over

not harriet equal! exclaim mr knightley loudli and warmly;
and with calmer asper ad a few moment afterward no he
is not her equal inde for he is as much her superior in sens
as in situat emma your infatu about that girl blind you
what are harriet smith claim either of birth natur or educ
to ani connexion higher than robert martin? she is the natur
daughter of nobodi know whom with probabl no settl provis
at all and certainli no respect relat she is known onli
as parlour-board at a common school she is not a sensibl girl
nor a girl of ani inform she ha been taught noth use
and is too young and too simpl to have acquir ani thing herself
at her age she can have no experi and with her littl wit
is not veri like ever to have ani that can avail her
she is pretti and she is good temper and that is all
my onli scrupl in advis the match wa on hi account as be
beneath hi desert and a bad connexion for him i felt that
as to fortun in all probabl he might do much better; and that as
to a ration companion or use helpmat he could not do wors
but i could not reason so to a man in love and wa will
to trust to there be no harm in her to her have that sort
of disposit which in good hand like hi might be easili led
aright and turn out veri well the advantag of the match i felt
to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have i now)
that there would be a gener cry-out upon her extrem good luck
even _your_ satisfact i made sure of it cross my mind immedi
that you would not regret your friend leav highburi for the
sake of her be settl so well i rememb say to myself
`even emma with all her partial for harriet will think thi a
good match

i cannot help wonder at your know so littl of emma as to say
ani such thing what! think a farmer (and with all hi sens and all
hi merit mr martin is noth more) a good match for my intim
friend! not regret her leav highburi for the sake of marri
a man whom i could never admit as an acquaint of my own! i
wonder you should think it possibl for me to have such feel
i assur you mine are veri differ i must think your statement
by no mean fair you are not just to harriet claim
they would be estim veri differ by other as well as myself;
mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedli
her inferior as to rank in society--th sphere in which she move
is much abov his--it would be a degrad

a degrad to illegitimaci and ignor to be marri
to a respect intellig gentleman-farmer!

as to the circumst of her birth though in a legal sens
she may be call nobodi it will not hold in common sens
she is not to pay for the offenc of other by be held below
the level of those with whom she is brought up--ther can scarc
be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of
fortune--h allow is veri liberal; noth ha ever been grudg
for her improv or comfort--that she is a gentleman daughter
is indubit to me; that she associ with gentlemen daughter
no one i apprehend will deny--sh is superior to mr robert martin

whoever might be her parent said mr knightley whoever may
have had the charg of her it doe not appear to have been ani part
of their plan to introduc her into what you would call good societi
after receiv a veri indiffer educ she is left in
mr goddard hand to shift as she can;--to move in short
in mr goddard line to have mr goddard acquaint
her friend evid thought thi good enough for her; and it _was_
good enough she desir noth better herself till you chose
to turn her into a friend her mind had no distast for her own set
nor ani ambit beyond it she wa as happi as possibl with the
martin in the summer she had no sens of superior then
if she ha it now you have given it you have been no friend to
harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceed so far
if he had not felt persuad of her not be disinclin to him
i know him well he ha too much real feel to address ani
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit
he is the farthest from it of ani man i know depend upon it he
had encourag

it wa most conveni to emma not to make a direct repli to thi
assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again

you are a veri warm friend to mr martin; but as i said befor
are unjust to harriet harriet claim to marri well are not
so contempt as you repres them she is not a clever girl
but she ha better sens than you are awar of and doe not
deserv to have her understand spoken of so slightingli
waiv that point howev and suppos her to be as you
describ her onli pretti and good-natur let me tell you that in
the degre she possess them they are not trivial recommend
to the world in gener for she is in fact a beauti girl
and must be thought so by ninety-nin peopl out of an hundred;
and till it appear that men are much more philosoph on the subject
of beauti than they are gener supposed; till they do fall
in love with well-inform mind instead of handsom face a girl
with such loveli as harriet ha a certainti of be admir
and sought after of have the power of chuse from among mani
consequ a claim to be nice her good-natur too is not so veri
slight a claim comprehend as it doe real thorough sweet
of temper and manner a veri humbl opinion of herself and a great
readi to be pleas with other peopl i am veri much mistaken
if your sex in gener would not think such beauti and such temper
the highest claim a woman could possess

upon my word emma to hear you abus the reason you have
is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sens
than misappli it as you do

to be sure! cri she play i know _that_ is the feel
of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactli
what everi man delight in--what at onc bewitch hi sens
and satisfi hi judgment oh! harriet may pick and chuse
were you yourself ever to marri she is the veri woman for you
and is she at seventeen just enter into life just begin
to be known to be wonder at becaus she doe not accept the first
offer she receives? no--pray let her have time to look about her

i have alway thought it a veri foolish intimaci said mr knightley
present though i have kept my thought to myself; but i now
perceiv that it will be a veri unfortun one for harriet
you will puff her up with such idea of her own beauti and of what
she ha a claim to that in a littl while nobodi within her
reach will be good enough for her vaniti work on a weak head
produc everi sort of mischief noth so easi as for a young ladi
to rais her expect too high miss harriet smith may not find
offer of marriag flow in so fast though she is a veri pretti girl
men of sens whatev you may chuse to say do not want silli wive
men of famili would not be veri fond of connect themselv
with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be
afraid of the inconveni and disgrac they might be involv in
when the mysteri of her parentag came to be reveal let her marri
robert martin and she is safe respect and happi for ever;
but if you encourag her to expect to marri greatli and teach
her to be satisfi with noth less than a man of consequ
and larg fortun she may be a parlour-board at mr goddard
all the rest of her life--or at least (for harriet smith is a
girl who will marri somebodi or other) till she grow desper
and is glad to catch at the old writing-mast son

we think so veri differ on thi point mr knightley
that there can be no use in canvass it we shall onli be make
each other more angri but as to my _letting_ her marri robert martin
it is impossible; she ha refus him and so decidedli i think
as must prevent ani second applic she must abid by the evil
of have refus him whatev it may be; and as to the refus itself
i will not pretend to say that i might not influenc her a little;
but i assur you there wa veri littl for me or for ani bodi to do
hi appear is so much against him and hi manner so bad
that if she ever were dispos to favour him she is not now
i can imagin that befor she had seen ani bodi superior
she might toler him he wa the brother of her friend
and he took pain to pleas her; and altogeth have seen
nobodi better (that must have been hi great assistant)
she might not while she wa at abbey-mil find him disagre
but the case is alter now she know now what gentlemen are;
and noth but a gentleman in educ and manner ha ani chanc
with harriet

nonsens errant nonsens as ever wa talked! cri mr knightley--robert
martin manner have sens sincer and good-humour to recommend
them; and hi mind ha more true gentil than harriet smith could understand

emma made no answer and tri to look cheer unconcern but wa
realli feel uncomfort and want him veri much to be gone
she did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself
a better judg of such a point of femal right and refin than he
could be; but yet she had a sort of habitu respect for hi judgment
in gener which made her dislik have it so loudli against her;
and to have him sit just opposit to her in angri state
wa veri disagre some minut pass in thi unpleas silenc
with onli one attempt on emma side to talk of the weather
but he made no answer he wa think the result of hi thought
appear at last in these word

robert martin ha no great loss--if he can but think so; and i
hope it will not be long befor he doe your view for harriet
are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love
of match-mak it is fair to suppos that view and plan
and project you have;--and as a friend i shall just hint to you
that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain

emma laugh and disclaim he continu

depend upon it elton will not do elton is a veri good sort of man
and a veri respect vicar of highburi but not at all like
to make an imprud match he know the valu of a good incom
as well as ani bodi elton may talk sentiment but he will
act ration he is as well acquaint with hi own claim as you
can be with harriet he know that he is a veri handsom young man
and a great favourit wherev he goes; and from hi gener way
of talk in unreserv moment when there are onli men present
i am convinc that he doe not mean to throw himself away
i have heard him speak with great anim of a larg famili
of young ladi that hi sister are intim with who have all
twenti thousand pound apiec

i am veri much oblig to you said emma laugh again
if i had set my heart on mr elton marri harriet it would
have been veri kind to open my eyes; but at present i onli want
to keep harriet to myself i have done with match-mak inde
i could never hope to equal my own do at randal i shall leav
off while i am well

good morn to you--said he rise and walk off abruptli
he wa veri much vex he felt the disappoint of the young man
and wa mortifi to have been the mean of promot it by the
sanction he had given; and the part which he wa persuad emma had
taken in the affair wa provok him exceedingli

emma remain in a state of vexat too; but there wa more
indistinct in the caus of her than in hi she did not alway
feel so absolut satisfi with herself so entir convinc that
her opinion were right and her adversari wrong as mr knightley
he walk off in more complet self-approb than he left for her
she wa not so materi cast down howev but that a littl
time and the return of harriet were veri adequ restor
harriet stay away so long wa begin to make her uneasi
the possibl of the young man come to mr goddard
that morn and meet with harriet and plead hi own caus
gave alarm idea the dread of such a failur after all becam the
promin uneasiness; and when harriet appear and in veri good spirit
and without have ani such reason to give for her long absenc
she felt a satisfact which settl her with her own mind
and convinc her that let mr knightley think or say what he would
she had done noth which woman friendship and woman feel
would not justifi

he had frighten her a littl about mr elton; but when she consid
that mr knightley could not have observ him as she had done
neither with the interest nor (she must be allow to tell herself
in spite of mr knightley pretensions) with the skill of such
an observ on such a question as herself that he had spoken it
hastili and in anger she wa abl to believ that he had rather
said what he wish resent to be true than what he knew
ani thing about he certainli might have heard mr elton speak
with more unreserv than she had ever done and mr elton might not
be of an imprud inconsider disposit as to money matters;
he might natur be rather attent than otherwis to them;
but then mr knightley did not make due allow for the influenc
of a strong passion at war with all interest motiv mr knightley
saw no such passion and of cours thought noth of it effects;
but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of it overcom ani
hesit that a reason prudenc might origin suggest;
and more than a reason becom degre of prudenc she wa veri
sure did not belong to mr elton

harriet cheer look and manner establish hers: she came back
not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton miss nash
had been tell her someth which she repeat immedi
with great delight mr perri had been to mr goddard to attend
a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash
that as he wa come back yesterday from clayton park he had met
mr elton and found to hi great surpriz that mr elton wa
actual on hi road to london and not mean to return till
the morrow though it wa the whist-club night which he had been
never known to miss before; and mr perri had remonstr with him
about it and told him how shabbi it wa in him their best player
to absent himself and tri veri much to persuad him to put off
hi journey onli one day; but it would not do; mr elton had been
determin to go on and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way inde
that he wa go on busi which he would not put off for ani
induc in the world; and someth about a veri enviabl commiss
and be the bearer of someth exceedingli preciou mr perri
could not quit understand him but he wa veri sure there must
be a _lady_ in the case and he told him so; and mr elton onli
look veri consciou and smile and rode off in great spirit
miss nash had told her all thi and had talk a great deal more
about mr elton; and said look so veri significantli at her
that she did not pretend to understand what hi busi might be
but she onli knew that ani woman whom mr elton could prefer
she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for beyond a doubt
mr elton had not hi equal for beauti or agreeabl



chapter ix


mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel
with herself he wa so much displeas that it wa longer than
usual befor he came to hartfield again; and when they did meet
hi grave look shew that she wa not forgiven she wa sorri
but could not repent on the contrari her plan and proceed
were more and more justifi and endear to her by the gener
appear of the next few day

the pictur elegantli frame came safe to hand soon after
mr elton return and be hung over the mantelpiec of the common
sitting-room he got up to look at it and sigh out hi half sentenc
of admir just as he ought; and as for harriet feel they were
visibl form themselv into as strong and steadi an attach
as her youth and sort of mind admit emma wa soon perfectli
satisfi of mr martin be no otherwis rememb than as
he furnish a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantag to the latter

her view of improv her littl friend mind by a great deal
of use read and convers had never yet led to more than
a few first chapter and the intent of go on to-morrow
it wa much easier to chat than to study; much pleasant to let
her imagin rang and work at harriet fortun than to be
labour to enlarg her comprehens or exercis it on sober facts;
and the onli literari pursuit which engag harriet at present
the onli mental provis she wa make for the even of life
wa the collect and transcrib all the riddl of everi sort
that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot-press paper
made up by her friend and ornament with cipher and trophi

in thi age of literatur such collect on a veri grand scale
are not uncommon miss nash head-teach at mr goddard
had written out at least three hundred; and harriet who had taken
the first hint of it from her hope with miss woodhous help
to get a great mani more emma assist with her invent
memori and taste; and as harriet wrote a veri pretti hand
it wa like to be an arrang of the first order in form
as well as quantiti

mr woodhous wa almost as much interest in the busi as the girl
and tri veri often to recollect someth worth their put in
so mani clever riddl as there use to be when he wa young--h
wonder he could not rememb them! but he hope he should in time
and it alway end in kitti a fair but frozen maid

hi good friend perri too whom he had spoken to on the subject
did not at present recollect ani thing of the riddl kind;
but he had desir perri to be upon the watch and as he went about
so much someth he thought might come from that quarter

it wa by no mean hi daughter wish that the intellect of
highburi in gener should be put under requisit mr elton
wa the onli one whose assist she ask he wa invit
to contribut ani realli good enigma charad or conundrum
that he might recollect; and she had the pleasur of see him
most intent at work with hi recollections; and at the same time
as she could perceiv most earnestli care that noth ungal
noth that did not breath a compliment to the sex should pass
hi lip they owe to him their two or three politest puzzles;
and the joy and exult with which at last he recal
and rather sentiment recit that well-known charad

my first doth afflict denot
which my second is destind to feel
and my whole is the best antidot
that afflict to soften and heal--

made her quit sorri to acknowledg that they had transcrib it
some page ago alreadi

whi will not you write one yourself for us mr elton? said she;
that is the onli secur for it freshness; and noth could be
easier to you

oh no! he had never written hardli ever ani thing of the kind
in hi life the stupidest fellow! he wa afraid not even miss
woodhouse--h stopt a moment--or miss smith could inspir him

the veri next day howev produc some proof of inspir
he call for a few moment just to leav a piec of paper on the
tabl contain as he said a charad which a friend of hi had
address to a young ladi the object of hi admir but which
from hi manner emma wa immedi convinc must be hi own

i do not offer it for miss smith collect said he
be my friend i have no right to expos it in ani degre
to the public eye but perhap you may not dislik look at it

the speech wa more to emma than to harriet which emma
could understand there wa deep conscious about him
and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend
he wa gone the next moment:--aft anoth moment paus

take it said emma smile and push the paper toward
harriet--it is for you take your own

but harriet wa in a tremor and could not touch it; and emma
never loth to be first wa oblig to examin it herself

to miss--

charad

my first display the wealth and pomp of king
lord of the earth! their luxuri and eas
anoth view of man my second bring
behold him there the monarch of the seas!

but ah! unit what revers we have!
man boast power and freedom all are flown;
lord of the earth and sea he bend a slave
and woman love woman reign alon

thi readi wit the word will soon suppli
may it approv beam in that soft eye!

she cast her eye over it ponder caught the mean read it through
again to be quit certain and quit mistress of the line and then
pass it to harriet sat happili smile and say to herself
while harriet wa puzzl over the paper in all the confus
of hope and dul veri well mr elton veri well inde
i have read wors charad _courtship_--a veri good hint i give
you credit for it thi is feel your way thi is say veri
plainly--`pray miss smith give me leav to pay my address to you
approv my charad and my intent in the same glanc

may it approv beam in that soft eye!

harriet exactli soft is the veri word for her eye--of all epithet
the justest that could be given

thi readi wit the word will soon suppli

humph--harriet readi wit! all the better a man must be veri much
in love inde to describ her so ah! mr knightley i wish
you had the benefit of this; i think thi would convinc you
for onc in your life you would be oblig to own yourself mistaken
an excel charad indeed! and veri much to the purpos
thing must come to a crisi soon now

she wa oblig to break off from these veri pleasant observ
which were otherwis of a sort to run into great length by the
eager of harriet wonder question

what can it be miss woodhouse?--what can it be? i have not an idea--i
cannot guess it in the least what can it possibl be? do tri
to find it out miss woodhous do help me i never saw ani thing
so hard is it kingdom? i wonder who the friend was--and who could
be the young ladi do you think it is a good one? can it be woman?

and woman love woman reign alon

can it be neptune?

behold him there the monarch of the seas!

or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? oh no! shark is onli
one syllabl it must be veri clever or he would not have brought it
oh! miss woodhous do you think we shall ever find it out?

mermaid and sharks! nonsense! my dear harriet what are you
think of? where would be the use of hi bring us a charad made
by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? give me the paper and listen

for miss ---------- read miss smith

my first display the wealth and pomp of king
lord of the earth! their luxuri and eas

that is _court_

anoth view of man my second brings;
behold him there the monarch of the seas!

that is _ship_;--plain as it can be--now for the cream

but ah! unit (_courtship_ you know) what revers we have!
man boast power and freedom all are flown
lord of the earth and sea he bend a slave
and woman love woman reign alon

a veri proper compliment!--and then follow the applic
which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulti
in comprehend read it in comfort to yourself there can
be no doubt of it be written for you and to you

harriet could not long resist so delight a persuas
she read the conclud line and wa all flutter and happi
she could not speak but she wa not want to speak it wa enough
for her to feel emma spoke for her

there is so point and so particular a mean in thi compliment
said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton intent
you are hi object--and you will soon receiv the completest proof
of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived;
but now it is clear; the state of hi mind is as clear and decid
as my wish on the subject have been ever sinc i knew you
ye harriet just so long have i been want the veri circumst
to happen what ha happen i could never tell whether an attach
between you and mr elton were most desir or most natur
it probabl and it elig have realli so equal each
other! i am veri happi i congratul you my dear harriet with all
my heart thi is an attach which a woman may well feel pride
in creat thi is a connexion which offer noth but good
it will give you everi thing that you want--consider independ
a proper home--it will fix you in the centr of all your real friend
close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimaci for ever
thi harriet is an allianc which can never rais a blush in either
of us

dear miss woodhouse!--and dear miss woodhous wa all that harriet
with mani tender embrac could articul at first; but when they
did arriv at someth more like convers it wa suffici
clear to her friend that she saw felt anticip and rememb
just as she ought mr elton superior had veri ampl acknowledg

whatev you say is alway right cri harriet and therefor
i suppos and believ and hope it must be so; but otherwis i could
not have imagin it it is so much beyond ani thing i deserv
mr elton who might marri ani body! there cannot be two opinion
about _him_ he is so veri superior onli think of those sweet
verses--`to miss -------- dear me how clever!--could it realli
be meant for me?

i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that
it is a certainti receiv it on my judgment it is a sort
of prologu to the play a motto to the chapter; and will be soon
follow by matter-of-fact prose

it is a sort of thing which nobodi could have expect i am sure
a month ago i had no more idea myself!--th strangest thing do
take place!

when miss smith and mr elton get acquainted--they do indeed--and
realli it is strange; it is out of the common cours that what is
so evid so palpabl desirable--what court the pre-arrang
of other peopl should so immedi shape itself into the proper form
you and mr elton are by situat call together; you belong
to one anoth by everi circumst of your respect home
your marri will be equal to the match at randal there doe
seem to be a someth in the air of hartfield which give love
exactli the right direct and send it into the veri channel
where it ought to flow

the cours of true love never did run smooth--

a hartfield edit of shakespear would have a long note on that passag

that mr elton should realli be in love with me--m of all peopl
who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas! and he
the veri handsomest man that ever wa and a man that everi bodi
look up to quit like mr knightley! hi compani so sought after
that everi bodi say he need not eat a singl meal by himself if he
doe not chuse it; that he ha more invit than there are day
in the week and so excel in the church! miss nash ha put down
all the text he ha ever preach from sinc he came to highburi
dear me! when i look back to the first time i saw him! how littl
did i think!--th two abbot and i ran into the front room and
peep through the blind when we heard he wa go by and miss
nash came and scold us away and staid to look through herself;
howev she call me back present and let me look too
which wa veri good-natur and how beauti we thought he looked!
he wa arm-in-arm with mr cole

thi is an allianc which whoever--whatev your friend may be
must be agreeabl to them provid at least they have common sense;
and we are not to be address our conduct to fool if they
are anxiou to see you _happily_ marri here is a man whose amiabl
charact give everi assur of it;--if they wish to have you
settl in the same countri and circl which they have chosen
to place you in here it will be accomplished; and if their onli
object is that you should in the common phrase be _well_ marri
here is the comfort fortun the respect establish
the rise in the world which must satisfi them

ye veri true how nice you talk; i love to hear you
you understand everi thing you and mr elton are one as clever
as the other thi charade!--if i had studi a twelvemonth
i could never have made ani thing like it

i thought he meant to tri hi skill by hi manner of declin
it yesterday

i do think it is without except the best charad i ever read

i never read one more to the purpos certainli

it is as long again as almost all we have had befor

i do not consid it length as particularli in it favour
such thing in gener cannot be too short

harriet wa too intent on the line to hear the most satisfactori
comparison were rise in her mind

it is one thing said she presently--h cheek in a glow--to
have veri good sens in a common way like everi bodi els
and if there is ani thing to say to sit down and write a letter
and say just what you must in a short way; and anoth to write
vers and charad like thi

emma could not have desir a more spirit reject of mr martin prose

such sweet lines! continu harriet--thes two last!--but
how shall i ever be abl to return the paper or say i have found
it out?--oh! miss woodhous what can we do about that?

leav it to me you do noth he will be here thi even
i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsens
or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed--your
soft eye shall chuse their own time for beam trust to me

oh! miss woodhous what a piti that i must not write thi beauti
charad into my book! i am sure i have not got one half so good

leav out the two last line and there is no reason whi you
should not write it into your book

oh! but those two line are--

--the best of all granted;--for privat enjoyment; and for privat
enjoy keep them they are not at all the less written you know
becaus you divid them the couplet doe not ceas to be nor doe
it mean chang but take it away and all _appropriation_ ceas
and a veri pretti gallant charad remain fit for ani collect
depend upon it he would not like to have hi charad slight
much better than hi passion a poet in love must be encourag in
both capac or neither give me the book i will write it down
and then there can be no possibl reflect on you

harriet submit though her mind could hardli separ the part
so as to feel quit sure that her friend were not write down
a declar of love it seem too preciou an offer for ani
degre of public

i shall never let that book go out of my own hand said she

veri well repli emma; a most natur feeling; and the longer
it last the better i shall be pleas but here is my father
coming: you will not object to my read the charad to him
it will be give him so much pleasure! he love ani thing of
the sort and especi ani thing that pay woman a compliment
he ha the tenderest spirit of gallantri toward us all!--you must
let me read it to him

harriet look grave

my dear harriet you must not refin too much upon thi
charade--y will betray your feel improperli if you are
too consciou and too quick and appear to affix more mean
or even quit all the mean which may be affix to it
do not be overpow by such a littl tribut of admir
if he had been anxiou for secreci he would not have left the paper
while i wa by; but he rather push it toward me than toward you
do not let us be too solemn on the busi he ha encourag
enough to proceed without our sigh out our soul over thi charad

oh! no--i hope i shall not be ridicul about it do as you pleas

mr woodhous came in and veri soon led to the subject again
by the recurr of hi veri frequent inquiri of well my dear
how doe your book go on?--hav you got ani thing fresh?

ye papa; we have someth to read you someth quit fresh
a piec of paper wa found on the tabl thi morning--(dropt
we suppos by a fairy)--contain a veri pretti charad and we
have just copi it in

she read it to him just as he like to have ani thing read
slowli and distinctli and two or three time over with explan
of everi part as she proceeded--and he wa veri much pleas and
as she had foreseen especi struck with the complimentari conclus

aye that veri just inde that veri properli said
veri true `woman love woman it is such a pretti charad
my dear that i can easili guess what fairi brought it--nobodi
could have written so prettili but you emma

emma onli nod and smiled--aft a littl think
and a veri tender sigh he ad

ah! it is no difficulti to see who you take after! your dear mother
wa so clever at all those things! if i had but her memory! but i
can rememb nothing;--not even that particular riddl which you
have heard me mention; i can onli recollect the first stanza;
and there are sever

kitti a fair but frozen maid
kindl a flame i yet deplor
the hood-winkd boy i call to aid
though of hi near approach afraid
so fatal to my suit befor

and that is all that i can recollect of it--but it is veri clever
all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it

ye papa it is written out in our second page we copi it
from the eleg extract it wa garrick you know

aye veri true--i wish i could recollect more of it

kitti a fair but frozen maid

the name make me think of poor isabella; for she wa veri near
be christen catherin after her grandmama i hope we shall
have her here next week have you thought my dear where you
shall put her--and what room there will be for the children?

oh! yes--sh will have her own room of course; the room she alway
has;--and there is the nurseri for the children--just as usual
you know whi should there be ani change?

i do not know my dear--but it is so long sinc she wa here!--not
sinc last easter and then onli for a few days--mr john knightley
be a lawyer is veri inconvenient--poor isabella!--sh is sadli
taken away from us all!--and how sorri she will be when she come
not to see miss taylor here!

she will not be surpriz papa at least

i do not know my dear i am sure i wa veri much surpriz
when i first heard she wa go to be marri

we must ask mr and mr weston to dine with us while isabella
is here

ye my dear if there is time--but--(in a veri depress tone)--sh
is come for onli one week there will not be time for ani thing

it is unfortun that they cannot stay longer--but it seem a case
of necess mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th
and we ought to be thank papa that we are to have the whole
of the time they can give to the countri that two or three day
are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promis
to give up hi claim thi christmas--though you know it is longer
sinc they were with him than with us

it would be veri hard inde my dear if poor isabella were
to be anywher but at hartfield

mr woodhous could never allow for mr knightley claim on
hi brother or ani bodi claim on isabella except hi own
he sat muse a littl while and then said

but i do not see whi poor isabella should be oblig to go back
so soon though he doe i think emma i shall tri and persuad
her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay veri well

ah! papa--that is what you never have been abl to accomplish
and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay
behind her husband

thi wa too true for contradict unwelcom as it wa mr woodhous
could onli give a submiss sigh; and as emma saw hi spirit
affect by the idea of hi daughter attach to her husband
she immedi led to such a branch of the subject as must rais them

harriet must give us as much of her compani as she can while
my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleas
with the children we are veri proud of the children are not we
papa? i wonder which she will think the handsomest henri or john?

aye i wonder which she will poor littl dear how glad they
will be to come they are veri fond of be at hartfield harriet

i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not

henri is a fine boy but john is veri like hi mama henri is the eldest
he wa name after me not after hi father john the second
is name after hi father some peopl are surpriz i believ
that the eldest wa not but isabella would have him call henri
which i thought veri pretti of her and he is a veri clever boy
inde they are all remark clever; and they have so mani
pretti way they will come and stand by my chair and say
`grandpapa can you give me a bit of string? and onc henri ask me
for a knife but i told him knive were onli made for grandpapa
i think their father is too rough with them veri often

he appear rough to you said emma becaus you are so veri
gentl yourself; but if you could compar him with other papa
you would not think him rough he wish hi boy to be activ and hardy;
and if they misbehav can give them a sharp word now and then;
but he is an affection father--certainli mr john knightley
is an affection father the children are all fond of him

and then their uncl come in and toss them up to the ceil
in a veri fright way!

but they like it papa; there is noth they like so much
it is such enjoy to them that if their uncl did not lay down
the rule of their take turn whichev began would never give way
to the other

well i cannot understand it

that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot
understand the pleasur of the other

later in the morn and just as the girl were go to separ
in prepar for the regular four oclock dinner the hero
of thi inimit charad walk in again harriet turn away;
but emma could receiv him with the usual smile and her quick eye
soon discern in hi the conscious of have made a push--of
have thrown a die; and she imagin he wa come to see how it
might turn up hi ostens reason howev wa to ask whether
mr woodhous parti could be made up in the even without him
or whether he should be in the smallest degre necessari at hartfield
if he were everi thing els must give way; but otherwis hi friend
cole had been say so much about hi dine with him--had made
such a point of it that he had promis him condit to come

emma thank him but could not allow of hi disappoint hi
friend on their account; her father wa sure of hi rubber
he re-urged--sh re-declined; and he seem then about to make
hi bow when take the paper from the tabl she return it--

oh! here is the charad you were so oblig as to leav with us;
thank you for the sight of it we admir it so much that i have
ventur to write it into miss smith collect your friend
will not take it amiss i hope of cours i have not transcrib
beyond the first eight line

mr elton certainli did not veri well know what to say
he look rather doubtingly--rath confused; said someth about
honour--glanc at emma and at harriet and then see the book
open on the tabl took it up and examin it veri attent
with the view of pass off an awkward moment emma smilingli said

you must make my apolog to your friend; but so good a charad
must not be confin to one or two he may be sure of everi woman
approb while he write with such gallantri

i have no hesit in say repli mr elton though hesit
a good deal while he spoke; i have no hesit in saying--at
least if my friend feel at all as _i_ do--i have not the smallest
doubt that could he see hi littl effus honour as _i_ see it
(look at the book again and replac it on the table) he
would consid it as the proudest moment of hi life

after thi speech he wa gone as soon as possibl emma could not
think it too soon; for with all hi good and agreeabl qualiti
there wa a sort of parad in hi speech which wa veri apt
to inclin her to laugh she ran away to indulg the inclin
leav the tender and the sublim of pleasur to harriet share



chapter x


though now the middl of decemb there had yet been no weather
to prevent the young ladi from toler regular exercise;
and on the morrow emma had a charit visit to pay to a poor
sick famili who live a littl way out of highburi

their road to thi detach cottag wa down vicarag lane a lane
lead at right angl from the broad though irregular main street
of the place; and as may be infer contain the bless abod
of mr elton a few inferior dwell were first to be pass
and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarag
an old and not veri good hous almost as close to the road as it
could be it had no advantag of situation; but had been veri much
smarten up by the present proprietor; and such as it wa
there could be no possibl of the two friend pass it without
a slacken pace and observ eyes--emma remark was--

there it is there go you and your riddle-book one of these days--
harriet was--

oh what a sweet house!--how veri beautiful!--ther are the yellow
curtain that miss nash admir so much

i do not often walk thi way _now_ said emma as they proceed
but _then_ there will be an induc and i shall gradual get
intim acquaint with all the hedg gate pool and pollard
of thi part of highburi

harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarag
and her curios to see it wa so extrem that consid exterior
and probabl emma could onli class it as a proof of love
with mr elton see readi wit in her

i wish we could contriv it said she; but i cannot think
of ani toler pretenc for go in;--no servant that i want
to inquir about of hi housekeeper--no messag from my father

she ponder but could think of noth after a mutual silenc
of some minut harriet thu began again--

i do so wonder miss woodhous that you should not be marri
or go to be married! so charm as you are!--

emma laugh and repli

my be charm harriet is not quit enough to induc me to marry;
i must find other peopl charming--on other person at least
and i am not onli not go to be marri at present but have
veri littl intent of ever marri at all

ah!--so you say; but i cannot believ it

i must see somebodi veri superior to ani one i have seen yet
to be tempted; mr elton you know (recollect herself)
is out of the question: and i do _not_ wish to see ani such person
i would rather not be tempt i cannot realli chang for the better
if i were to marri i must expect to repent it

dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!--

i have none of the usual induc of women to marri
were i to fall in love inde it would be a differ thing!
but i never have been in love; it is not my way or my nature;
and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i
should be a fool to chang such a situat as mine fortun i
do not want; employ i do not want; consequ i do not want:
i believ few marri women are half as much mistress of their
husband hous as i am of hartfield; and never never could i expect
to be so truli belov and important; so alway first and alway
right in ani man eye as i am in my father

but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates!

that is as formid an imag as you could present harriet; and if i
thought i should ever be like miss bates! so silly--so satisfied--
so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguish and unfastidious--
and so apt to tell everi thing rel to everi bodi about me
i would marri to-morrow but between _us_ i am convinc there never
can be ani like except in be unmarri

but still you will be an old maid! and that so dreadful!

never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid; and it is
poverti onli which make celibaci contempt to a gener public!
a singl woman with a veri narrow incom must be a ridicul
disagre old maid! the proper sport of boy and girl
but a singl woman of good fortun is alway respect
and may be as sensibl and pleasant as ani bodi els and the
distinct is not quit so much against the candour and common
sens of the world as appear at first; for a veri narrow incom
ha a tendenc to contract the mind and sour the temper
those who can bare live and who live perforc in a veri small
and gener veri inferior societi may well be illiber and cross
thi doe not appli howev to miss bates; she is onli too good
natur and too silli to suit me; but in gener she is veri
much to the tast of everi bodi though singl and though poor
poverti certainli ha not contract her mind: i realli believ
if she had onli a shill in the world she would be veri like
to give away sixpenc of it; and nobodi is afraid of her: that is a
great charm

dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself
when you grow old?

if i know myself harriet mine is an activ busi mind with a great
mani independ resources; and i do not perceiv whi i should be
more in want of employ at forti or fifti than one-and-twenti
woman usual occup of hand and mind will be as open to me then
as they are now; or with no import variat if i draw less
i shall read more; if i give up music i shall take to carpet-work
and as for object of interest object for the affect
which is in truth the great point of inferior the want of which
is realli the great evil to be avoid in _not_ marri i shall
be veri well off with all the children of a sister i love so much
to care about there will be enough of them in all probabl
to suppli everi sort of sensat that declin life can need
there will be enough for everi hope and everi fear; and though my
attach to none can equal that of a parent it suit my idea
of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephew
and nieces!--i shall often have a niec with me

do you know miss batess niece? that is i know you must have
seen her a hundr times--but are you acquainted?

oh! yes; we are alway forc to be acquaint whenev she come
to highburi by the bye _that_ is almost enough to put one out
of conceit with a niec heaven forbid! at least that i should
ever bore peopl half so much about all the knightley togeth
as she doe about jane fairfax one is sick of the veri name
of jane fairfax everi letter from her is read forti time over;
her compliment to all friend go round and round again; and if she
doe but send her aunt the pattern of a stomach or knit a pair
of garter for her grandmoth one hear of noth els for a month
i wish jane fairfax veri well; but she tire me to death

they were now approach the cottag and all idl topic
were supersed emma wa veri compassionate; and the distress
of the poor were as sure of relief from her person attent
and kind her counsel and her patienc as from her purs
she understood their way could allow for their ignor and
their temptat had no romant expect of extraordinari
virtu from those for whom educ had done so little; enter into
their troubl with readi sympathi and alway gave her assist
with as much intellig as good-wil in the present instanc
it wa sick and poverti togeth which she came to visit;
and after remain there as long as she could give comfort or advic
she quit the cottag with such an impress of the scene
as made her say to harriet as they walk away

these are the sight harriet to do one good how trifl they
make everi thing els appear!--i feel now as if i could think of
noth but these poor creatur all the rest of the day; and yet
who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?

veri true said harriet poor creatures! one can think
of noth els

and realli i do not think the impress will soon be over
said emma as she cross the low hedg and totter footstep
which end the narrow slipperi path through the cottag garden
and brought them into the lane again i do not think it will
stop to look onc more at all the outward wretched of the place
and recal the still greater within

oh! dear no said her companion

they walk on the lane made a slight bend; and when that bend
wa pass mr elton wa immedi in sight; and so near
as to give emma time onli to say farther

ah! harriet here come a veri sudden trial of our stabil
in good thought well (smiling) i hope it may be allow that
if compass ha produc exert and relief to the suffer
it ha done all that is truli import if we feel for the wretch
enough to do all we can for them the rest is empti sympathi
onli distress to ourselv

harriet could just answer oh! dear ye befor the gentleman
join them the want and suffer of the poor famili howev
were the first subject on meet he had been go to call
on them hi visit he would now defer; but they had a veri
interest parley about what could be done and should be done
mr elton then turn back to accompani them

to fall in with each other on such an errand as thi thought emma;
to meet in a charit scheme; thi will bring a great increas
of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring
on the declar it must if i were not here i wish i were
anywher els

anxiou to separ herself from them as far as she could she soon
afterward took possess of a narrow footpath a littl rais
on one side of the lane leav them togeth in the main road
but she had not been there two minut when she found that harriet
habit of depend and imit were bring her up too and that
in short they would both be soon after her thi would not do;
she immedi stop under pretenc of have some alter
to make in the lace of her half-boot and stoop down in complet
occup of the footpath beg them to have the good to walk on
and she would follow in half a minut they did as they were desired;
and by the time she judg it reason to have done with her boot
she had the comfort of farther delay in her power be overtaken
by a child from the cottag set out accord to order
with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield to walk by the side
of thi child and talk to and question her wa the most natur
thing in the world or would have been the most natur had she been
act just then without design; and by thi mean the other were
still abl to keep ahead without ani oblig of wait for her
she gain on them howev involuntarily: the child pace wa quick
and their rather slow; and she wa the more concern at it
from their be evid in a convers which interest them
mr elton wa speak with anim harriet listen with a veri
pleas attention; and emma have sent the child on wa begin
to think how she might draw back a littl more when they both
look around and she wa oblig to join them

mr elton wa still talk still engag in some interest detail;
and emma experienc some disappoint when she found that he
wa onli give hi fair companion an account of the yesterday
parti at hi friend cole and that she wa come in herself for
the stilton chees the north wiltshir the butter the celleri
the beet-root and all the dessert

thi would soon have led to someth better of cours wa her
consol reflection; ani thing interest between those who love;
and ani thing will serv as introduct to what is near the heart
if i could but have kept longer away!

they now walk on togeth quietli till within view of the vicarag
pale when a sudden resolut of at least get harriet into
the hous made her again find someth veri much amiss about her boot
and fall behind to arrang it onc more she then broke the lace
off short and dexter throw it into a ditch wa present
oblig to entreat them to stop and acknowledg her inabl to
put herself to right so as to be abl to walk home in toler comfort

part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am
to contriv i realli am a most troublesom companion to you both
but i hope i am not often so ill-equip mr elton i must beg
leav to stop at your hous and ask your housekeep for a bit
of ribband or string or ani thing just to keep my boot on

mr elton look all happi at thi proposition; and noth
could exceed hi alert and attent in conduct them into
hi hous and endeavour to make everi thing appear to advantag
the room they were taken into wa the one he chiefli occupi
and look forwards; behind it wa anoth with which it immedi
communicated; the door between them wa open and emma pass
into it with the housekeep to receiv her assist in the most
comfort manner she wa oblig to leav the door ajar as she
found it; but she fulli intend that mr elton should close it
it wa not close howev it still remain ajar; but by engag
the housekeep in incess convers she hope to make it
practic for him to chuse hi own subject in the adjoin room
for ten minut she could hear noth but herself it could
be protract no longer she wa then oblig to be finish
and make her appear

the lover were stand togeth at one of the window it had a
most favour aspect; and for half a minut emma felt the glori
of have scheme success but it would not do; he had not
come to the point he had been most agreeabl most delightful;
he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purpos
follow them; other littl gallantri and allus had been dropt
but noth seriou

cautiou veri cautiou thought emma; he advanc inch by inch
and will hazard noth till he believ himself secur

still howev though everi thing had not been accomplish
by her ingeni devic she could not but flatter herself
that it had been the occas of much present enjoy to both
and must be lead them forward to the great event



chapter xi


mr elton must now be left to himself it wa no longer in emma
power to superintend hi happi or quicken hi measur
the come of her sister famili wa so veri near at hand
that first in anticip and then in realiti it becam henceforth
her prime object of interest; and dure the ten day of their stay
at hartfield it wa not to be expected--sh did not herself expect--
that ani thing beyond occasion fortuit assist could
be afford by her to the lover they might advanc rapidli
if they would however; they must advanc somehow or other whether
they would or no she hardli wish to have more leisur for them
there are peopl who the more you do for them the less they will
do for themselv

mr and mr john knightley from have been longer than usual
absent from surri were excit of cours rather more than the
usual interest till thi year everi long vacat sinc their
marriag had been divid between hartfield and donwel abbey;
but all the holiday of thi autumn had been given to sea-bath
for the children and it wa therefor mani month sinc they had
been seen in a regular way by their surri connexion or seen at all
by mr woodhous who could not be induc to get so far as london
even for poor isabella sake; and who consequ wa now most
nervous and apprehens happi in forestal thi too short visit

he thought much of the evil of the journey for her and not a
littl of the fatigu of hi own hors and coachman who were to
bring some of the parti the last half of the way; but hi alarm
were needless; the sixteen mile be happili accomplish
and mr and mr john knightley their five children and a compet
number of nursery-maid all reach hartfield in safeti
the bustl and joy of such an arriv the mani to be talk to
welcom encourag and various dispers and dispos of
produc a nois and confus which hi nerv could not have born
under ani other caus nor have endur much longer even for this;
but the way of hartfield and the feel of her father were
so respect by mr john knightley that in spite of matern
solicitud for the immedi enjoy of her littl one
and for their have instantli all the liberti and attend
all the eat and drink and sleep and play
which they could possibl wish for without the smallest delay
the children were never allow to be long a disturb to him
either in themselv or in ani restless attend on them

mr john knightley wa a pretti eleg littl woman of gentl
quiet manner and a disposit remark amiabl and affectionate;
wrapt up in her family; a devot wife a doat mother
and so tenderli attach to her father and sister that but for
these higher tie a warmer love might have seem imposs
she could never see a fault in ani of them she wa not a woman
of strong understand or ani quickness; and with thi resembl
of her father she inherit also much of hi constitution;
wa delic in her own health over-car of that of her children
had mani fear and mani nerv and wa as fond of her own mr wingfield
in town as her father could be of mr perri they were alik too
in a gener benevol of temper and a strong habit of regard
for everi old acquaint

mr john knightley wa a tall gentleman-lik and veri clever man;
rise in hi profess domest and respect in hi
privat character; but with reserv manner which prevent hi be
gener pleasing; and capabl of be sometim out of humour
he wa not an ill-temp man not so often unreason cross
as to deserv such a reproach; but hi temper wa not hi
great perfection; and inde with such a worship wife
it wa hardli possibl that ani natur defect in it should not
be increas the extrem sweet of her temper must hurt hi
he had all the clear and quick of mind which she want
and he could sometim act an ungraci or say a sever thing

he wa not a great favourit with hi fair sister-in-law noth
wrong in him escap her she wa quick in feel the littl
injuri to isabella which isabella never felt herself
perhap she might have pass over more had hi manner been
flatter to isabella sister but they were onli those of a calmli
kind brother and friend without prais and without blindness;
but hardli ani degre of person compliment could have made her
regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eye which he sometim
fell into the want of respect forbear toward her father
there he had not alway the patienc that could have been wish
mr woodhous peculiar and fidgeti were sometim provok
him to a ration remonstr or sharp retort equal ill-bestow
it did not often happen; for mr john knightley had realli a great
regard for hi father-in-law and gener a strong sens of what wa
due to him; but it wa too often for emma chariti especi as
there wa all the pain of apprehens frequent to be endur
though the offenc came not the begin howev of everi visit
display none but the properest feel and thi be of necess
so short might be hope to pass away in unsulli cordial
they had not been long seat and compos when mr woodhous
with a melancholi shake of the head and a sigh call hi daughter
attent to the sad chang at hartfield sinc she had been there last

ah my dear said he poor miss taylor--it is a grievou busi

oh ye sir cri she with readi sympathi how you must
miss her! and dear emma too!--what a dread loss to you both!--
i have been so griev for you--i could not imagin how you could
possibl do without her--it is a sad chang indeed--but i hope
she is pretti well sir

pretti well my dear--i hope--pretti well--i do not know
but that the place agre with her toler

mr john knightley here ask emma quietli whether there were ani
doubt of the air of randal

oh! no--non in the least i never saw mr weston better in my life--
never look so well papa is onli speak hi own regret

veri much to the honour of both wa the handsom repli

and do you see her sir toler often? ask isabella
in the plaintiv tone which just suit her father

mr woodhous hesitated--not near so often my dear as i could wish

oh! papa we have miss see them but one entir day sinc
they marri either in the morn or even of everi day
except one have we seen either mr weston or mr weston
and gener both either at randal or here--and as you
may suppos isabella most frequent here they are veri
veri kind in their visit mr weston is realli as kind as herself
papa if you speak in that melancholi way you will be give
isabella a fals idea of us all everi bodi must be awar that miss
taylor must be miss but everi bodi ought also to be assur
that mr and mr weston do realli prevent our miss her by ani
mean to the extent we ourselv anticipated--which is the exact truth

just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hope
it wa from your letter her wish of shew you attent could
not be doubt and hi be a disengag and social man make it
all easi i have been alway tell you my love that i had no idea
of the chang be so veri materi to hartfield as you apprehended;
and now you have emma account i hope you will be satisfi

whi to be sure said mr woodhouse--y certainly--i cannot deni
that mr weston poor mr weston doe come and see us pretti often--
but then--sh is alway oblig to go away again

it would be veri hard upon mr weston if she did not papa--
you quit forget poor mr weston

i think inde said john knightley pleasantli that mr weston
ha some littl claim you and i emma will ventur to take the part
of the poor husband i be a husband and you not be a wife
the claim of the man may veri like strike us with equal forc
as for isabella she ha been marri long enough to see the conveni
of put all the mr weston asid as much as she can

me my love cri hi wife hear and understand onli in part--
are you talk about me?--i am sure nobodi ought to be or can be
a greater advoc for matrimoni than i am; and if it had not been
for the miseri of her leav hartfield i should never have thought
of miss taylor but as the most fortun woman in the world;
and as to slight mr weston that excel mr weston i think
there is noth he doe not deserv i believ he is one of the
veri best-temp men that ever exist except yourself
and your brother i do not know hi equal for temper i shall
never forget hi fli henri kite for him that veri windi day
last easter--and ever sinc hi particular kind last septemb
twelvemonth in write that note at twelv oclock at night
on purpos to assur me that there wa no scarlet fever at cobham
i have been convinc there could not be a more feel heart nor
a better man in existence--if ani bodi can deserv him it must be
miss taylor

where is the young man? said john knightley ha he been here
on thi occasion--or ha he not?

he ha not been here yet repli emma there wa a strong
expect of hi come soon after the marriag but it end
in nothing; and i have not heard him mention late

but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father
he wrote a letter to poor mr weston to congratul her
and a veri proper handsom letter it wa she shew it to me
i thought it veri well done of him inde whether it wa hi own idea
you know one cannot tell he is but young and hi uncl perhaps--

my dear papa he is three-and-twenti you forget how time pass

three-and-twenty!--i he indeed?--wel i could not have thought it--
and he wa but two year old when he lost hi poor mother! well
time doe fli indeed!--and my memori is veri bad howev it wa
an exceed good pretti letter and gave mr and mr weston
a great deal of pleasur i rememb it wa written from weymouth
and date sept 28th--and began `mi dear madam but i forget
how it went on; and it wa sign `f c weston churchill--
i rememb that perfectli

how veri pleas and proper of him! cri the good-heart mr john
knightley i have no doubt of hi be a most amiabl young man
but how sad it is that he should not live at home with hi father!
there is someth so shock in a child be taken away from hi
parent and natur home! i never could comprehend how mr weston
could part with him to give up one child! i realli never
could think well of ani bodi who propos such a thing to ani bodi els

nobodi ever did think well of the churchil i fanci
observ mr john knightley coolli but you need not imagin
mr weston to have felt what you would feel in give up henri
or john mr weston is rather an easi cheerful-temp man
than a man of strong feelings; he take thing as he find them
and make enjoy of them somehow or other depend i suspect
much more upon what is call societi for hi comfort that is
upon the power of eat and drink and play whist with hi
neighbour five time a week than upon famili affect or ani
thing that home afford

emma could not like what border on a reflect on mr weston
and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggl and let
it pass she would keep the peac if possible; and there wa
someth honour and valuabl in the strong domest habit
the all-suffici of home to himself whenc result her brother
disposit to look down on the common rate of social intercours
and those to whom it wa important--it had a high claim to forbear



chapter xii


mr knightley wa to dine with them--rath against the inclin
of mr woodhous who did not like that ani one should share with him
in isabella first day emma sens of right howev had decid it;
and besid the consider of what wa due to each brother
she had particular pleasur from the circumst of the late
disagr between mr knightley and herself in procur him
the proper invit

she hope they might now becom friend again she thought it
wa time to make up making-up inde would not do _she_ certainli
had not been in the wrong and _he_ would never own that he had
concess must be out of the question; but it wa time to appear
to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hope it might rather
assist the restor of friendship that when he came into the room
she had one of the children with her--th youngest a nice littl girl
about eight month old who wa now make her first visit to hartfield
and veri happi to be danc about in her aunt arm it did assist;
for though he began with grave look and short question he wa soon
led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child
out of her arm with all the unceremoni of perfect amiti
emma felt they were friend again; and the convict give
her at first great satisfact and then a littl sauci
she could not help say as he wa admir the babi

what a comfort it is that we think alik about our nephew and niec
as to men and women our opinion are sometim veri different;
but with regard to these children i observ we never disagre

if you were as much guid by natur in your estim of men
and women and as littl under the power of fanci and whim in your
deal with them as you are where these children are concern
we might alway think alik

to be sure--our discord must alway aris from my be
in the wrong

ye said he smiling--and reason good i wa sixteen year
old when you were born

a materi differ then she replied--and no doubt you were
much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but doe
not the laps of one-and-twenti year bring our understand
a good deal nearer?

yes--a good deal _nearer_

but still not near enough to give me a chanc of be right
if we think differ

i have still the advantag of you by sixteen year experi and by
not be a pretti young woman and a spoil child come my dear emma
let us be friend and say no more about it tell your aunt littl emma
that she ought to set you a better exampl than to be renew
old grievanc and that if she were not wrong befor she is now

that true she cried--veri true littl emma grow up
a better woman than your aunt be infinit clever and not
half so conceit now mr knightley a word or two more and i
have done as far as good intent went we were _both_ right
and i must say that no effect on my side of the argument have yet
prove wrong i onli want to know that mr martin is not veri
veri bitterli disappoint

a man cannot be more so wa hi short full answer

ah!--inde i am veri sorry--com shake hand with me

thi had just taken place and with great cordial when john
knightley made hi appear and how dye do george? and john
how are you? succeed in the true english style buri under
a calm that seem all but indiffer the real attach
which would have led either of them if requisit to do everi thing
for the good of the other

the even wa quiet and convers as mr woodhous declin
card entir for the sake of comfort talk with hi
dear isabella and the littl parti made two natur divisions;
on one side he and hi daughter; on the other the two mr knightleys;
their subject total distinct or veri rare mixing--and emma
onli occasion join in one or the other

the brother talk of their own concern and pursuit but princip
of those of the elder whose temper wa by much the most commun
and who wa alway the greater talker as a magistr he had
gener some point of law to consult john about or at least
some curiou anecdot to give; and as a farmer as keep in hand
the home-farm at donwel he had to tell what everi field wa to bear
next year and to give all such local inform as could not fail
of be interest to a brother whose home it had equal been
the longest part of hi life and whose attach were strong
the plan of a drain the chang of a fenc the fell of a tree
and the destin of everi acr for wheat turnip or spring corn
wa enter into with as much equal of interest by john as hi
cooler manner render possible; and if hi will brother ever
left him ani thing to inquir about hi inquiri even approach
a tone of eager

while they were thu comfort occupi mr woodhous wa enjoy
a full flow of happi regret and fear affect with hi daughter

my poor dear isabella said he fondli take her hand
and interrupt for a few moment her busi labour for some one
of her five children--how long it is how terribl long sinc you
were here! and how tire you must be after your journey! you must
go to bed earli my dear--and i recommend a littl gruel to you
befor you go--you and i will have a nice basin of gruel togeth
my dear emma suppos we all have a littl gruel

emma could not suppos ani such thing know as she did
that both the mr knightley were as unpersuad on that articl
as herself;--and two basin onli were order after a littl
more discours in prais of gruel with some wonder at it
not be taken everi even by everi bodi he proceed to say
with an air of grave reflect

it wa an awkward busi my dear your spend the autumn
at south end instead of come here i never had much opinion
of the sea air

mr wingfield most strenuous recommend it sir--or we
should not have gone he recommend it for all the children
but particularli for the weak in littl bella throat--
both sea air and bath

ah! my dear but perri had mani doubt about the sea do her
ani good; and as to myself i have been long perfectli convinc
though perhap i never told you so befor that the sea is veri
rare of use to ani bodi i am sure it almost kill me onc

come come cri emma feel thi to be an unsaf subject i must
beg you not to talk of the sea it make me enviou and miserable;--
i who have never seen it! south end is prohibit if you pleas
my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiri about
mr perri yet; and he never forget you

oh! good mr perry--how is he sir?

whi pretti well; but not quit well poor perri is biliou
and he ha not time to take care of himself--h tell me he ha
not time to take care of himself--which is veri sad--but he is
alway want all round the countri i suppos there is not a man
in such practic anywher but then there is not so clever a man
ani where

and mr perri and the children how are they? do the children grow?
i have a great regard for mr perri i hope he will be call soon
he will be so pleas to see my littl one

i hope he will be here to-morrow for i have a question or two to ask
him about myself of some consequ and my dear whenev he come
you had better let him look at littl bella throat

oh! my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardli
ani uneasi about it either bath ha been of the greatest
servic to her or els it is to be attribut to an excel
embroc of mr wingfield which we have been appli
at time ever sinc august

it is not veri like my dear that bath should have been
of use to her--and if i had known you were want an embroc
i would have spoken to--

you seem to me to have forgotten mr and miss bate said emma
i have not heard one inquiri after them

oh! the good bateses--i am quit asham of myself--but you
mention them in most of your letter i hope they are quit well
good old mr bates--i will call upon her to-morrow and take
my children--they are alway so pleas to see my children--
and that excel miss bates!--such thorough worthi people!--
how are they sir?

whi pretti well my dear upon the whole but poor mr bate
had a bad cold about a month ago

how sorri i am! but cold were never so preval as they have been
thi autumn mr wingfield told me that he ha never known them
more gener or heavy--except when it ha been quit an influenza

that ha been a good deal the case my dear; but not to the degre
you mention perri say that cold have been veri gener
but not so heavi as he ha veri often known them in novemb
perri doe not call it altogeth a sickli season

no i do not know that mr wingfield consid it _very_ sickli except--

ah! my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is alway
a sickli season nobodi is healthi in london nobodi can be
it is a dread thing to have you forc to live there! so far off!--
and the air so bad!

no indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air our part of london is
veri superior to most others!--y must not confound us with london
in gener my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick squar
is veri differ from almost all the rest we are so veri airy!
i should be unwil i own to live in ani other part of the town;--
there is hardli ani other that i could be satisfi to have my
children in: but _we_ are so remark airy!--mr wingfield think
the vicin of brunswick squar decidedli the most favour as
to air

ah! my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it--
but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you
differ creatures; you do not look like the same now i cannot say
that i think you are ani of you look well at present

i am sorri to hear you say so sir; but i assur you except those
littl nervou head-ach and palpit which i am never entir
free from anywher i am quit well myself; and if the children were
rather pale befor they went to bed it wa onli becaus they were
a littl more tire than usual from their journey and the happi
of come i hope you will think better of their look to-morrow;
for i assur you mr wingfield told me that he did not believ
he had ever sent us off altogeth in such good case i trust
at least that you do not think mr knightley look ill
turn her eye with affection anxieti toward her husband

middl my dear; i cannot compliment you i think mr john
knightley veri far from look well

what is the matter sir?--did you speak to me? cri mr john
knightley hear hi own name

i am sorri to find my love that my father doe not think you
look well--but i hope it is onli from be a littl fatigu
i could have wish howev as you know that you had seen
mr wingfield befor you left home

my dear isabella--exclaim he hastily--pray do not concern
yourself about my look be satisfi with doctor and coddl
yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse

i did not thoroughli understand what you were tell your brother
cri emma about your friend mr graham intend to have a bailiff
from scotland to look after hi new estat what will it answer?
will not the old prejudic be too strong?

and she talk in thi way so long and success that when forc
to give her attent again to her father and sister she had noth
wors to hear than isabella kind inquiri after jane fairfax;
and jane fairfax though no great favourit with her in gener
she wa at that moment veri happi to assist in prais

that sweet amiabl jane fairfax! said mr john knightley--
it is so long sinc i have seen her except now and then for a moment
accident in town! what happi it must be to her good old
grandmoth and excel aunt when she come to visit them!
i alway regret excess on dear emma account that she cannot
be more at highbury; but now their daughter is marri i suppos
colonel and mr campbel will not be abl to part with her at all
she would be such a delight companion for emma

mr woodhous agre to it all but ad

our littl friend harriet smith howev is just such anoth
pretti kind of young person you will like harriet emma could
not have a better companion than harriet

i am most happi to hear it--but onli jane fairfax one know to be
so veri accomplish and superior!--and exactli emma age

thi topic wa discuss veri happili and other succeed of
similar moment and pass away with similar harmony; but the even
did not close without a littl return of agit the gruel came
and suppli a great deal to be said--much prais and mani comments--
undoubt decis of it wholesom for everi constitut
and pretti sever philipp upon the mani hous where it wa
never met with tolerable;--but unfortun among the failur
which the daughter had to instanc the most recent and therefor
most promin wa in her own cook at south end a young woman
hire for the time who never had been abl to understand what she
meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin
often as she had wish for and order it she had never been abl
to get ani thing toler here wa a danger open

ah! said mr woodhous shake hi head and fix hi eye on
her with tender concern--th ejacul in emma ear express
ah! there is no end of the sad consequ of your go to
south end it doe not bear talk of and for a littl while
she hope he would not talk of it and that a silent rumin
might suffic to restor him to the relish of hi own smooth gruel
after an interv of some minut howev he began with

i shall alway be veri sorri that you went to the sea thi autumn
instead of come here

but whi should you be sorri sir?--i assur you it did the children
a great deal of good

and moreov if you must go to the sea it had better not
have been to south end south end is an unhealthi place
perri wa surpriz to hear you had fix upon south end

i know there is such an idea with mani peopl but inde it is
quit a mistak sir--w all had our health perfectli well there
never found the least inconveni from the mud; and mr wingfield
say it is entir a mistak to suppos the place unhealthy;
and i am sure he may be depend on for he thoroughli understand
the natur of the air and hi own brother and famili have been
there repeatedli

you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere--
perri wa a week at cromer onc and he hold it to be the best
of all the sea-bath place a fine open sea he say and veri
pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodg there
quit away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--veri comfort
you should have consult perri

but my dear sir the differ of the journey;--onli consid how
great it would have been--an hundr mile perhap instead of forti

ah! my dear as perri say where health is at stake noth els
should be considered; and if one is to travel there is not much
to chuse between forti mile and an hundred--bett not move at all
better stay in london altogeth than travel forti mile to get
into a wors air thi is just what perri said it seem to him
a veri ill-judg measur

emma attempt to stop her father had been vain; and when he
had reach such a point as thi she could not wonder at her
brother-in-law break out

mr perri said he in a voic of veri strong displeasur
would do as well to keep hi opinion till it is ask for
whi doe he make it ani busi of hi to wonder at what i do?--
at my take my famili to one part of the coast or another?--i may
be allow i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry--
i want hi direct no more than hi drug he paused--
and grow cooler in a moment ad with onli sarcast dryness
if mr perri can tell me how to convey a wife and five children
a distanc of an hundr and thirti mile with no greater expens
or inconveni than a distanc of forti i should be as will to
prefer cromer to south end as he could himself

true true cri mr knightley with most readi interposition--
veri true that a consider indeed--but john as to what i
wa tell you of my idea of move the path to langham of turn
it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadow
i cannot conceiv ani difficulti i should not attempt it
if it were to be the mean of inconveni to the highburi peopl
but if you call to mind exactli the present line of the path
the onli way of prove it howev will be to turn to our map
i shall see you at the abbey to-morrow morn i hope and then we
will look them over and you shall give me your opinion

mr woodhous wa rather agit by such harsh reflect on
hi friend perri to whom he had in fact though unconsci
been attribut mani of hi own feel and expressions;--
but the sooth attent of hi daughter gradual remov
the present evil and the immedi alert of one brother
and better recollect of the other prevent ani renew of it



chapter xiii


there could hardli be a happier creatur in the world than mr john
knightley in thi short visit to hartfield go about everi morn
among her old acquaint with her five children and talk
over what she had done everi even with her father and sister
she had noth to wish otherwis but that the day did not pass
so swiftli it wa a delight visit;--perfect in be much too short

in gener their even were less engag with friend than
their mornings; but one complet dinner engag and out
of the hous too there wa no avoid though at christma
mr weston would take no denial; they must all dine at randal
one day;--even mr woodhous wa persuad to think it a possibl
thing in prefer to a divis of the parti

how they were all to be convey he would have made a difficulti
if he could but as hi son and daughter carriag and hors
were actual at hartfield he wa not abl to make more than
a simpl question on that head; it hardli amount to a doubt;
nor did it occupi emma long to convinc him that they might in one
of the carriag find room for harriet also

harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especi set
were the onli person invit to meet them;--th hour were to be earli
as well as the number few; mr woodhous habit and inclin
be consult in everi thing

the even befor thi great event (for it wa a veri great event
that mr woodhous should dine out on the 24th of december) had been
spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indispos
with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of be nurs
by mr goddard emma could not have allow her to leav the hous
emma call on her the next day and found her doom alreadi sign
with regard to randal she wa veri feverish and had a bad
sore throat: mr goddard wa full of care and affect mr perri
wa talk of and harriet herself wa too ill and low to resist
the author which exclud her from thi delight engag
though she could not speak of her loss without mani tear

emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mr goddard
unavoid absenc and rais her spirit by repres how much
mr elton would be depress when he knew her state; and left her
at last toler comfort in the sweet depend of hi have
a most comfortless visit and of their all miss her veri much
she had not advanc mani yard from mr goddard door when she
wa met by mr elton himself evid come toward it and as
they walk on slowli togeth in convers about the invalid--
of whom he on the rumour of consider ill had been go
to inquir that he might carri some report of her to hartfield--
they were overtaken by mr john knightley return from the
daili visit to donwel with hi two eldest boy whose healthi
glow face shew all the benefit of a countri run and seem
to ensur a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pud they
were hasten home for they join compani and proceed togeth
emma wa just describ the natur of her friend complaint;--
a throat veri much inflam with a great deal of heat about her
a quick low puls &c and she wa sorri to find from mr goddard
that harriet wa liabl to veri bad sore-throat and had often
alarm her with them mr elton look all alarm on the occas
as he exclaim

a sore-throat!--i hope not infecti i hope not of a putrid
infecti sort ha perri seen her? inde you should take care
of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run
no risk whi doe not perri see her?

emma who wa not realli at all frighten herself tranquillis thi
excess of apprehens by assur of mr goddard experi
and care; but as there must still remain a degre of uneasi
which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather
feed and assist than not she ad soon afterwards--a if quit
anoth subject

it is so cold so veri cold--and look and feel so veri much
like snow that if it were to ani other place or with ani other parti
i should realli tri not to go out to-day--and dissuad my father
from venturing; but as he ha made up hi mind and doe not seem
to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfer as i know it
would be so great a disappoint to mr and mr weston but upon
my word mr elton in your case i should certainli excus myself
you appear to me a littl hoars alreadi and when you consid
what demand of voic and what fatigu to-morrow will bring
i think it would be no more than common prudenc to stay at home
and take care of yourself to-night

mr elton look as if he did not veri well know what answer to make;
which wa exactli the case; for though veri much gratifi by the kind
care of such a fair ladi and not like to resist ani advic of
her he had not realli the least inclin to give up the visit;--
but emma too eager and busi in her own previou concept
and view to hear him imparti or see him with clear vision
wa veri well satisfi with hi mutter acknowledg of it
be veri cold certainli veri cold and walk on rejoic in
have extric him from randal and secur him the power
of send to inquir after harriet everi hour of the even

you do quit right said she;--w will make your apolog
to mr and mr weston

but hardli had she so spoken when she found her brother wa civilli
offer a seat in hi carriag if the weather were mr elton
onli object and mr elton actual accept the offer with much
prompt satisfact it wa a done thing; mr elton wa to go
and never had hi broad handsom face express more pleasur than
at thi moment; never had hi smile been stronger nor hi eye
more exult than when he next look at her

well said she to herself thi is most strange!--aft i
had got him off so well to chuse to go into compani and leav
harriet ill behind!--most strang indeed!--but there is i believ
in mani men especi singl men such an inclination--
such a passion for dine out--a dinner engag is so high in
the class of their pleasur their employ their digniti
almost their duti that ani thing give way to it--and thi must
be the case with mr elton; a most valuabl amiabl pleas young
man undoubtedli and veri much in love with harriet; but still
he cannot refus an invit he must dine out wherev he is ask
what a strang thing love is! he can see readi wit in harriet
but will not dine alon for her

soon afterward mr elton quit them and she could not but do him
the justic of feel that there wa a great deal of sentiment
in hi manner of name harriet at parting; in the tone of hi
voic while assur her that he should call at mr goddard
for news of her fair friend the last thing befor he prepar
for the happi of meet her again when he hope to be
abl to give a better report; and he sigh and smile himself
off in a way that left the balanc of approb much in hi favour

after a few minut of entir silenc between them john knightley
began with--

i never in my life saw a man more intent on be agreeabl than
mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladi are concern
with men he can be ration and unaffect but when he ha ladi
to pleas everi featur work

mr elton manner are not perfect repli emma; but where there
is a wish to pleas one ought to overlook and one doe overlook
a great deal where a man doe hi best with onli moder power
he will have the advantag over neglig superior there is
such perfect good-temp and good-wil in mr elton as one cannot
but valu

ye said mr john knightley present with some slyness
he seem to have a great deal of good-wil toward you

me! she repli with a smile of astonish are you imagin
me to be mr elton object?

such an imagin ha cross me i own emma; and if it never
occur to you befor you may as well take it into consider now

mr elton in love with me!--what an idea!

i do not say it is so; but you will do well to consid whether
it is so or not and to regul your behaviour accordingli
i think your manner to him encourag i speak as a friend
emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do
and what you mean to do

i thank you; but i assur you you are quit mistaken mr elton
and i are veri good friend and noth more; and she walk on
amus herself in the consider of the blunder which often
aris from a partial knowledg of circumst of the mistak
which peopl of high pretens to judgment are for ever fall into;
and not veri well pleas with her brother for imagin her blind
and ignor and in want of counsel he said no more

mr woodhous had so complet made up hi mind to the visit
that in spite of the increas cold he seem to have no idea
of shrink from it and set forward at last most punctual
with hi eldest daughter in hi own carriag with less appar
conscious of the weather than either of the others; too full
of the wonder of hi own go and the pleasur it wa to afford at
randal to see that it wa cold and too well wrapt up to feel it
the cold howev wa severe; and by the time the second carriag
wa in motion a few flake of snow were find their way down
and the sky had the appear of be so overcharg as to want onli
a milder air to produc a veri white world in a veri short time

emma soon saw that her companion wa not in the happiest humour
the prepar and the go abroad in such weather with the sacrific
of hi children after dinner were evil were disagre at least
which mr john knightley did not by ani mean like; he anticip
noth in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;
and the whole of their drive to the vicarag wa spent by him in
express hi discont

a man said he must have a veri good opinion of himself when
he ask peopl to leav their own firesid and encount such
a day as thi for the sake of come to see him he must think
himself a most agreeabl fellow; i could not do such a thing
it is the greatest absurdity--actu snow at thi moment!--
the folli of not allow peopl to be comfort at home--and the
folli of peopl not stay comfort at home when they can!
if we were oblig to go out such an even as thi by ani call of
duti or busi what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we
probabl with rather thinner cloth than usual set forward
voluntarili without excus in defianc of the voic of natur
which tell man in everi thing given to hi view or hi feel
to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can;--
here are we set forward to spend five dull hour in anoth
man hous with noth to say or to hear that wa not said
and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to-morrow
go in dismal weather to return probabl in worse;--four hors
and four servant taken out for noth but to convey five idl
shiver creatur into colder room and wors compani than they
might have had at home

emma did not find herself equal to give the pleas assent which no doubt
he wa in the habit of receiv to emul the veri true my love
which must have been usual administ by hi travel companion;
but she had resolut enough to refrain from make ani answer
at all she could not be compli she dread be quarrelsome;
her heroism reach onli to silenc she allow him to talk
and arrang the glass and wrap herself up without open
her lip

they arriv the carriag turn the step wa let down
and mr elton spruce black and smile wa with them instantli
emma thought with pleasur of some chang of subject mr elton
wa all oblig and cheerfulness; he wa so veri cheer
in hi civil inde that she began to think he must have
receiv a differ account of harriet from what had reach her
she had sent while dress and the answer had been much the same--
not better

_my_ report from mr goddard said she present wa not
so pleasant as i had hoped--`not better wa _my_ answer

hi face lengthen immediately; and hi voic wa the voic
of sentiment as he answer

oh! no--i am griev to find--i wa on the point of tell you that
when i call at mr goddard door which i did the veri last thing
befor i return to dress i wa told that miss smith wa not better
by no mean better rather wors veri much griev and concerned--
i had flatter myself that she must be better after such a cordial
as i knew had been given her in the morn

emma smile and answered--mi visit wa of use to the nervou part
of her complaint i hope; but not even i can charm away a sore throat;
it is a most sever cold inde mr perri ha been with her
as you probabl heard

yes--i imagined--that is--i did not--

he ha been use to her in these complaint and i hope to-morrow
morn will bring us both a more comfort report but it is
imposs not to feel uneasi such a sad loss to our parti to-day!

dreadful!--exactli so indeed--sh will be miss everi moment

thi wa veri proper; the sigh which accompani it wa realli estimable;
but it should have last longer emma wa rather in dismay when
onli half a minut afterward he began to speak of other thing
and in a voic of the greatest alacr and enjoy

what an excel devic said he the use of a sheepskin
for carriag how veri comfort they make it;--imposs to
feel cold with such precaut the contriv of modern day
inde have render a gentleman carriag perfectli complet
one is so fenc and guard from the weather that not a breath
of air can find it way unpermit weather becom absolut
of no consequ it is a veri cold afternoon--but in thi carriag
we know noth of the matter--ha! snow a littl i see

ye said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal
of it

christma weather observ mr elton quit seasonable;
and extrem fortun we may think ourselv that it did not
begin yesterday and prevent thi day parti which it might veri
possibl have done for mr woodhous would hardli have ventur had
there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequ
thi is quit the season inde for friendli meet at christma
everi bodi invit their friend about them and peopl think littl
of even the worst weather i wa snow up at a friend hous onc
for a week noth could be pleasant i went for onli one night
and could not get away till that veri day sennight

mr john knightley look as if he did not comprehend the pleasur
but said onli coolli

i cannot wish to be snow up a week at randal

at anoth time emma might have been amus but she wa too
much astonish now at mr elton spirit for other feel
harriet seem quit forgotten in the expect of a pleasant parti

we are sure of excel fire continu he and everi thing
in the greatest comfort charm peopl mr and mr weston;--
mr weston inde is much beyond prais and he is exactli
what one valu so hospit and so fond of society;--
it will be a small parti but where small parti are select
they are perhap the most agreeabl of ani mr weston dining-room
doe not accommod more than ten comfortably; and for my part
i would rather under such circumst fall short by two than
exceed by two i think you will agre with me (turn with a soft
air to emma) i think i shall certainli have your approb
though mr knightley perhap from be use to the larg parti
of london may not quit enter into our feel

i know noth of the larg parti of london sir--i never dine
with ani bodi

indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity) i had no idea that the
law had been so great a slaveri well sir the time must come
when you will be paid for all thi when you will have littl
labour and great enjoy

my first enjoy repli john knightley as they pass through
the sweep-gat will be to find myself safe at hartfield again



chapter xiv


some chang of counten wa necessari for each gentleman
as they walk into mr weston drawing-room;--mr elton must
compos hi joyou look and mr john knightley dispers hi
ill-humour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more
to fit them for the place--emma onli might be as natur prompt
and shew herself just as happi as she wa to her it wa real
enjoy to be with the weston mr weston wa a great favourit
and there wa not a creatur in the world to whom she spoke with
such unreserv as to hi wife; not ani one to whom she relat
with such convict of be listen to and understood of be
alway interest and alway intellig the littl affair
arrang perplex and pleasur of her father and herself
she could tell noth of hartfield in which mr weston had not
a live concern; and half an hour uninterrupt commun
of all those littl matter on which the daili happi of privat
life depend wa one of the first gratif of each

thi wa a pleasur which perhap the whole day visit might
not afford which certainli did not belong to the present half-hour;
but the veri sight of mr weston her smile her touch her voic
wa grate to emma and she determin to think as littl as
possibl of mr elton odditi or of ani thing els unpleas
and enjoy all that wa enjoy to the utmost

the misfortun of harriet cold had been pretti well gone through
befor her arriv mr woodhous had been safe seat long
enough to give the histori of it besid all the histori of hi own
and isabella come and of emma be to follow and had inde
just got to the end of hi satisfact that jame should come
and see hi daughter when the other appear and mr weston
who had been almost wholli engross by her attent to him
wa abl to turn away and welcom her dear emma

emma project of forget mr elton for a while made her rather
sorri to find when they had all taken their place that he wa
close to her the difficulti wa great of drive hi strang
insens toward harriet from her mind while he not onli sat
at her elbow but wa continu obtrud hi happi counten
on her notic and solicit address her upon everi occas
instead of forget him hi behaviour wa such that she could
not avoid the intern suggest of can it realli be as my brother
imagined? can it be possibl for thi man to be begin to transfer
hi affect from harriet to me?--absurd and insufferable!--
yet he would be so anxiou for her be perfectli warm would be
so interest about her father and so delight with mr weston;
and at last would begin admir her draw with so much zeal
and so littl knowledg as seem terribl like a would-b lover
and made it some effort with her to preserv her good manner
for her own sake she could not be rude; and for harriet in the hope
that all would yet turn out right she wa even posit civil;
but it wa an effort; especi as someth wa go on amongst
the other in the most overpow period of mr elton nonsens
which she particularli wish to listen to she heard enough
to know that mr weston wa give some inform about hi son;
she heard the word my son and frank and my son
repeat sever time over; and from a few other half-syl
veri much suspect that he wa announc an earli visit from
hi son; but befor she could quiet mr elton the subject wa
so complet past that ani reviv question from her would have
been awkward

now it so happen that in spite of emma resolut of never marri
there wa someth in the name in the idea of mr frank churchil
which alway interest her she had frequent thought--especi sinc
hi father marriag with miss taylor--that if she _were_ to marri
he wa the veri person to suit her in age charact and condit
he seem by thi connexion between the famili quit to belong to her
she could not but suppos it to be a match that everi bodi who knew
them must think of that mr and mr weston did think of it she wa
veri strongli persuaded; and though not mean to be induc by him
or by ani bodi els to give up a situat which she believ more
replet with good than ani she could chang it for she had a great
curios to see him a decid intent of find him pleasant
of be like by him to a certain degre and a sort of pleasur
in the idea of their be coupl in their friend imagin

with such sensat mr elton civil were dread ill-timed;
but she had the comfort of appear veri polit while feel
veri cross--and of think that the rest of the visit could not
possibl pass without bring forward the same inform again
or the substanc of it from the open-heart mr weston--so it proved;--
for when happili releas from mr elton and seat by mr weston
at dinner he made use of the veri first interv in the care
of hospit the veri first leisur from the saddl of mutton
to say to her

we want onli two more to be just the right number i should
like to see two more here--your pretti littl friend miss smith
and my son--and then i should say we were quit complet
i believ you did not hear me tell the other in the drawing-room
that we are expect frank i had a letter from him thi morn
and he will be with us within a fortnight

emma spoke with a veri proper degre of pleasure; and fulli assent
to hi proposit of mr frank churchil and miss smith make
their parti quit complet

he ha been want to come to us continu mr weston
ever sinc september: everi letter ha been full of it;
but he cannot command hi own time he ha those to pleas
who must be pleas and who (between ourselves) are sometim
to be pleas onli by a good mani sacrific but now
i have no doubt of see him here about the second week in januari

what a veri great pleasur it will be to you! and mr weston
is so anxiou to be acquaint with him that she must be almost
as happi as yourself

ye she would be but that she think there will be anoth
put-off she doe not depend upon hi come so much as i do:
but she doe not know the parti so well as i do the case
you see is--(but thi is quit between ourselves: i did not mention
a syllabl of it in the other room there are secret in all famili
you know)--th case is that a parti of friend are invit to pay
a visit at enscomb in january; and that frank come depend upon
their be put off if they are not put off he cannot stir
but i know they will becaus it is a famili that a certain ladi
of some consequ at enscomb ha a particular dislik to:
and though it is thought necessari to invit them onc in two or
three year they alway are put off when it come to the point
i have not the smallest doubt of the issu i am as confid
of see frank here befor the middl of januari as i am
of be here myself: but your good friend there (nod
toward the upper end of the table) ha so few vagari herself
and ha been so littl use to them at hartfield that she cannot
calcul on their effect as i have been long in the practic
of do

i am sorri there should be ani thing like doubt in the case
repli emma; but am dispos to side with you mr weston if you
think he will come i shall think so too; for you know enscomb

yes--i have some right to that knowledge; though i have never been
at the place in my life--sh is an odd woman!--but i never allow
myself to speak ill of her on frank account; for i do believ
her to be veri fond of him i use to think she wa not capabl
of be fond of ani bodi except herself: but she ha alway been
kind to him (in her way--allow for littl whim and capric
and expect everi thing to be as she likes) and it is no small credit
in my opinion to him that he should excit such an affection;
for though i would not say it to ani bodi els she ha no more
heart than a stone to peopl in general; and the devil of a temper

emma like the subject so well that she began upon it to mr weston
veri soon after their move into the drawing-room: wish her joy--
yet observ that she knew the first meet must be rather alarming--
mr weston agre to it; but ad that she should be veri
glad to be secur of undergo the anxieti of a first meet
at the time talk of: for i cannot depend upon hi come
i cannot be so sanguin as mr weston i am veri much afraid
that it will all end in noth mr weston i dare say ha been
tell you exactli how the matter stands?

yes--it seem to depend upon noth but the ill-humour
of mr churchil which i imagin to be the most certain
thing in the world

my emma! repli mr weston smile what is the certainti
of caprice? then turn to isabella who had not been
attend before--y must know my dear mr knightley
that we are by no mean so sure of see mr frank churchil
in my opinion as hi father think it depend entir upon
hi aunt spirit and pleasure; in short upon her temper
to you--to my two daughters--i may ventur on the truth
mr churchil rule at enscomb and is a veri odd-temp woman;
and hi come now depend upon her be will to spare him

oh mr churchill; everi bodi know mr churchil
repli isabella: and i am sure i never think of that poor young
man without the greatest compass to be constantli live
with an ill-temp person must be dread it is what we
happili have never known ani thing of; but it must be a life
of miseri what a bless that she never had ani children!
poor littl creatur how unhappi she would have made them!

emma wish she had been alon with mr weston she should then have
heard more: mr weston would speak to her with a degre of unreserv
which she would not hazard with isabella; and she realli believ
would scarc tri to conceal ani thing rel to the churchil
from her except those view on the young man of which her own
imagin had alreadi given her such instinct knowledg
but at present there wa noth more to be said mr woodhous
veri soon follow them into the drawing-room to be sit
long after dinner wa a confin that he could not endur
neither wine nor convers wa ani thing to him; and gladli did
he move to those with whom he wa alway comfort

while he talk to isabella howev emma found an opportun
of say

and so you do not consid thi visit from your son as by ani
mean certain i am sorri for it the introduct must be unpleas
whenev it take place; and the sooner it could be over the better

yes; and everi delay make one more apprehens of other delay
even if thi famili the braithwait are put off i am still
afraid that some excus may be found for disappoint us
i cannot bear to imagin ani reluct on hi side; but i am sure
there is a great wish on the churchil to keep him to themselv
there is jealousi they are jealou even of hi regard for hi father
in short i can feel no depend on hi come and i wish mr weston
were less sanguin

he ought to come said emma if he could stay onli a coupl
of day he ought to come; and one can hardli conceiv a young man
not have it in hi power to do as much as that a young _woman_
if she fall into bad hand may be teaz and kept at a distanc
from those she want to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young
_man_ be under such restraint as not to be abl to spend a week
with hi father if he like it

one ought to be at enscomb and know the way of the famili
befor one decid upon what he can do repli mr weston
one ought to use the same caution perhap in judg of the
conduct of ani one individu of ani one family; but enscomb
i believ certainli must not be judg by gener rules:
_she_ is so veri unreasonable; and everi thing give way to her

but she is so fond of the nephew: he is so veri great a favourit
now accord to my idea of mr churchil it would be most natur
that while she make no sacrific for the comfort of the husband
to whom she owe everi thing while she exercis incess capric
toward _him_ she should frequent be govern by the nephew
to whom she owe noth at all

my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper
to understand a bad one or to lay down rule for it: you must
let it go it own way i have no doubt of hi have at time
consider influence; but it may be perfectli imposs for him
to know beforehand _when_ it will be

emma listen and then coolli said i shall not be satisfi
unless he come

he may have a great deal of influenc on some point
continu mr weston and on other veri little: and among those
on which she is beyond hi reach it is but too like may be
thi veri circumst of hi come away from them to visit us



chapter xv


mr woodhous wa soon readi for hi tea; and when he had drank hi
tea he wa quit readi to go home; and it wa as much as hi three
companion could do to entertain away hi notic of the late
of the hour befor the other gentlemen appear mr weston wa
chatti and convivi and no friend to earli separ of ani sort;
but at last the drawing-room parti did receiv an augment
mr elton in veri good spirit wa one of the first to walk in
mr weston and emma were sit togeth on a sofa he join
them immedi and with scarc an invit seat himself
between them

emma in good spirit too from the amus afford her mind
by the expect of mr frank churchil wa will to forget
hi late improprieti and be as well satisfi with him as befor
and on hi make harriet hi veri first subject wa readi to listen
with most friendli smile

he profess himself extrem anxiou about her fair friend--
her fair love amiabl friend did she know?--had she
heard ani thing about her sinc their be at randalls?--
he felt much anxiety--h must confess that the natur of her
complaint alarm him consider and in thi style he talk
on for some time veri properli not much attend to ani answer
but altogeth suffici awak to the terror of a bad sore throat;
and emma wa quit in chariti with him

but at last there seem a pervers turn; it seem all at onc as if
he were more afraid of it be a bad sore throat on her account
than on harriets--mor anxiou that she should escap the infect
than that there should be no infect in the complaint he began
with great earnest to entreat her to refrain from visit
the sick-chamb again for the present--to entreat her to _promise_
_him_ not to ventur into such hazard till he had seen mr perri
and learnt hi opinion; and though she tri to laugh it off
and bring the subject back into it proper cours there wa no
put an end to hi extrem solicitud about her she wa vex
it did appear--ther wa no conceal it--exactli like the pretenc
of be in love with her instead of harriet; an inconst
if real the most contempt and abominable! and she had difficulti
in behav with temper he turn to mr weston to implor
her assist would not she give him her support?--would not she
add her persuas to hi to induc miss woodhous not to go
to mr goddard till it were certain that miss smith disord
had no infection? he could not be satisfi without a promise--
would not she give him her influenc in procur it?

so scrupul for other he continu and yet so careless
for herself! she want me to nurs my cold by stay at home to-day
and yet will not promis to avoid the danger of catch an ulcer
sore throat herself is thi fair mr weston?--judg between us
have not i some right to complain? i am sure of your kind support
and aid

emma saw mr weston surpriz and felt that it must be great
at an address which in word and manner wa assum to himself
the right of first interest in her; and as for herself she wa
too much provok and offend to have the power of directli
say ani thing to the purpos she could onli give him a look;
but it wa such a look as she thought must restor him to hi sens
and then left the sofa remov to a seat by her sister and give
her all her attent

she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidli
did anoth subject succeed; for mr john knightley now came
into the room from examin the weather and open on them
all with the inform of the ground be cover with snow
and of it still snow fast with a strong drift wind;
conclud with these word to mr woodhouse:

thi will prove a spirit begin of your winter engag
sir someth new for your coachman and hors to be make
their way through a storm of snow

poor mr woodhous wa silent from consternation; but everi bodi els
had someth to say; everi bodi wa either surpriz or not surpriz
and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer mr weston
and emma tri earnestli to cheer him and turn hi attent
from hi son-in-law who wa pursu hi triumph rather unfeelingli

i admir your resolut veri much sir said he in ventur
out in such weather for of cours you saw there would be snow
veri soon everi bodi must have seen the snow come on
i admir your spirit; and i dare say we shall get home veri well
anoth hour or two snow can hardli make the road impassable;
and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part
of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we
shall be all safe at hartfield befor midnight

mr weston with triumph of a differ sort wa confess that he
had known it to be snow some time but had not said a word
lest it should make mr woodhous uncomfort and be an excus
for hi hurri away as to there be ani quantiti of snow fallen
or like to fall to imped their return that wa a mere joke;
he wa afraid they would find no difficulti he wish the road might
be impass that he might be abl to keep them all at randalls;
and with the utmost good-wil wa sure that accommod might
be found for everi bodi call on hi wife to agre with him
that with a littl contriv everi bodi might be lodg
which she hardli knew how to do from the conscious of there
be but two spare room in the hous

what is to be done my dear emma?--what is to be done?
wa mr woodhous first exclam and all that he could say
for some time to her he look for comfort; and her assur
of safeti her represent of the excel of the hors
and of jame and of their have so mani friend about them
reviv him a littl

hi eldest daughter alarm wa equal to hi own the horror of
be block up at randal while her children were at hartfield
wa full in her imagination; and fanci the road to be now just
passabl for adventur peopl but in a state that admit no delay
she wa eager to have it settl that her father and emma should remain
at randal while she and her husband set forward instantli through
all the possibl accumul of drift snow that might imped them

you had better order the carriag directli my love said she;
i dare say we shall be abl to get along if we set off directly;
and if we do come to ani thing veri bad i can get out and walk
i am not at all afraid i should not mind walk half the way
i could chang my shoe you know the moment i got home; and it is not
the sort of thing that give me cold

indeed! repli he then my dear isabella it is the most
extraordinari sort of thing in the world for in gener everi
thing doe give you cold walk home!--y are prettili shod
for walk home i dare say it will be bad enough for the hors

isabella turn to mr weston for her approb of the plan
mr weston could onli approv isabella then went to emma;
but emma could not so entir give up the hope of their be
all abl to get away; and they were still discuss the point
when mr knightley who had left the room immedi after hi
brother first report of the snow came back again and told them
that he had been out of door to examin and could answer for there
not be the smallest difficulti in their get home whenev they
like it either now or an hour henc he had gone beyond the sweep--
some way along the highburi road--th snow wa nowher abov half
an inch deep--in mani place hardli enough to whiten the ground;
a veri few flake were fall at present but the cloud were part
and there wa everi appear of it be soon over he had seen
the coachmen and they both agre with him in there be noth
to apprehend

to isabella the relief of such tide wa veri great and they
were scarc less accept to emma on her father account
who wa immedi set as much at eas on the subject as hi nervou
constitut allowed; but the alarm that had been rais could not
be appeas so as to admit of ani comfort for him while he continu
at randal he wa satisfi of there be no present danger in
return home but no assur could convinc him that it wa safe
to stay; and while the other were various urg and recommend
mr knightley and emma settl it in a few brief sentences: thus--

your father will not be easy; whi do not you go?

i am readi if the other are

shall i ring the bell?

ye do

and the bell wa rung and the carriag spoken for a few
minut more and emma hope to see one troublesom companion
deposit in hi own hous to get sober and cool and the other
recov hi temper and happi when thi visit of hardship were over

the carriag came: and mr woodhous alway the first object on
such occas wa care attend to hi own by mr knightley
and mr weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some
renew of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actual fallen
and the discoveri of a much darker night than he had been prepar for
he wa afraid they should have a veri bad drive he wa afraid
poor isabella would not like it and there would be poor emma
in the carriag behind he did not know what they had best do
they must keep as much togeth as they could; and jame wa talk to
and given a charg to go veri slow and wait for the other carriag

isabella stept in after her father; john knightley forget that he
did not belong to their parti stept in after hi wife veri naturally;
so that emma found on be escort and follow into the second
carriag by mr elton that the door wa to be law shut on them
and that they were to have a tete-a-tet drive it would not have been
the awkward of a moment it would have been rather a pleasur
previou to the suspicion of thi veri day; she could have talk
to him of harriet and the three-quart of a mile would have
seem but one but now she would rather it had not happen
she believ he had been drink too much of mr weston good wine
and felt sure that he would want to be talk nonsens

to restrain him as much as might be by her own manner she wa
immedi prepar to speak with exquisit calm and graviti
of the weather and the night; but scarc had she begun scarc had
they pass the sweep-gat and join the other carriag than she
found her subject cut up--her hand seized--h attent demand
and mr elton actual make violent love to her: avail himself
of the preciou opportun declar sentiment which must be alreadi
well known hoping--fearing--adoring--readi to die if she refus him;
but flatter himself that hi ardent attach and unequal
love and unexampl passion could not fail of have some effect
and in short veri much resolv on be serious accept as soon
as possibl it realli wa so without scruple--without apology--
without much appar diffid mr elton the lover of harriet
wa profess himself _her_ lover she tri to stop him; but vainly;
he would go on and say it all angri as she wa the thought of
the moment made her resolv to restrain herself when she did speak
she felt that half thi folli must be drunken and therefor
could hope that it might belong onli to the pass hour
accordingli with a mixtur of the seriou and the play which she
hope would best suit hi half and half state she repli

i am veri much astonish mr elton thi to _me_! you forget yourself--
you take me for my friend--ani messag to miss smith i shall
be happi to deliver; but no more of thi to _me_ if you pleas

miss smith!--messag to miss smith!--what could she possibl mean!--
and he repeat her word with such assur of accent such boast
pretenc of amaz that she could not help repli with quick

mr elton thi is the most extraordinari conduct! and i can account
for it onli in one way; you are not yourself or you could not speak
either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself
enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it

but mr elton had onli drunk wine enough to elev hi spirit
not at all to confus hi intellect he perfectli knew hi own meaning;
and have warmli protest against her suspicion as most injuri
and slightli touch upon hi respect for miss smith as her friend--
but acknowledg hi wonder that miss smith should be mention
at all--h resum the subject of hi own passion and wa veri
urgent for a favour answer

as she thought less of hi inebrieti she thought more of hi inconst
and presumption; and with fewer struggl for polit repli

it is imposs for me to doubt ani longer you have made
yourself too clear mr elton my astonish is much beyond
ani thing i can express after such behaviour as i have wit
dure the last month to miss smith--such attent as i
have been in the daili habit of observing--to be address me
in thi manner--thi is an unsteadi of charact inde
which i had not suppos possible! believ me sir i am far
veri far from gratifi in be the object of such profess

good heaven! cri mr elton what can be the mean of this?--
miss smith!--i never thought of miss smith in the whole cours
of my existence--nev paid her ani attent but as your friend:
never care whether she were dead or aliv but as your friend
if she ha fanci otherwis her own wish have misl her
and i am veri sorry--extrem sorry--but miss smith indeed!--oh!
miss woodhouse! who can think of miss smith when miss woodhous
is near! no upon my honour there is no unsteadi of charact
i have thought onli of you i protest against have paid the smallest
attent to ani one els everi thing that i have said or done
for mani week past ha been with the sole view of mark my
ador of yourself you cannot realli serious doubt it
no!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--i am sure you have seen
and understood me

it would be imposs to say what emma felt on hear this--
which of all her unpleas sensat wa uppermost she wa
too complet overpow to be immedi abl to reply:
and two moment of silenc be ampl encourag for mr elton
sanguin state of mind he tri to take her hand again as he
joyous exclaimed--

charm miss woodhouse! allow me to interpret thi interest silenc
it confess that you have long understood me

no sir cri emma it confess no such thing so far from
have long understood you i have been in a most complet error
with respect to your view till thi moment as to myself i am
veri sorri that you should have been give way to ani feelings--
noth could be farther from my wishes--your attach to my
friend harriet--your pursuit of her (pursuit it appeared) gave me
great pleasur and i have been veri earnestli wish you success:
but had i suppos that she were not your attract to hartfield
i should certainli have thought you judg ill in make your visit
so frequent am i to believ that you have never sought to recommend
yourself particularli to miss smith?--that you have never thought
serious of her?

never madam cri he affront in hi turn: never i assur you
_i_ think serious of miss smith!--miss smith is a veri good sort
of girl; and i should be happi to see her respect settl
i wish her extrem well: and no doubt there are men who might not
object to--everi bodi ha their level: but as for myself i am not
i think quit so much at a loss i need not so total despair
of an equal allianc as to be address myself to miss smith!--
no madam my visit to hartfield have been for yourself only;
and the encourag i received--

encouragement!--i give you encouragement!--sir you have been entir
mistaken in suppos it i have seen you onli as the admir
of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than
a common acquaint i am exceedingli sorry: but it is well that
the mistak end where it doe had the same behaviour continu
miss smith might have been led into a misconcept of your views;
not be awar probabl ani more than myself of the veri
great inequ which you are so sensibl of but as it is
the disappoint is singl and i trust will not be last
i have no thought of matrimoni at present

he wa too angri to say anoth word; her manner too decid
to invit supplication; and in thi state of swell resent
and mutual deep mortif they had to continu togeth a few
minut longer for the fear of mr woodhous had confin them
to a foot-pac if there had not been so much anger there would have
been desper awkwardness; but their straightforward emot left
no room for the littl zigzag of embarrass without know
when the carriag turn into vicarag lane or when it stop
they found themselv all at onc at the door of hi house;
and he wa out befor anoth syllabl passed--emma then felt it
indispens to wish him a good night the compliment wa just return
coldli and proudly; and under indescrib irrit of spirit
she wa then convey to hartfield

there she wa welcom with the utmost delight by her father
who had been trembl for the danger of a solitari drive from
vicarag lane--turn a corner which he could never bear to think of--
and in strang hands--a mere common coachman--no james; and there it
seem as if her return onli were want to make everi thing go well:
for mr john knightley asham of hi ill-humour wa now all
kind and attention; and so particularli solicit for the comfort
of her father as to seem--if not quit readi to join him in a basin
of gruel--perfectli sensibl of it be exceedingli wholesome;
and the day wa conclud in peac and comfort to all their littl parti
except herself--but her mind had never been in such perturbation;
and it need a veri strong effort to appear attent and cheer till
the usual hour of separ allow her the relief of quiet reflect



chapter xvi


the hair wa curl and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think
and be miserable--it wa a wretch busi indeed!--such an overthrow
of everi thing she had been wish for!--such a develop of everi
thing most unwelcome!--such a blow for harriet!--that wa the worst
of all everi part of it brought pain and humili of some sort
or other; but compar with the evil to harriet all wa light;
and she would gladli have submit to feel yet more mistaken--
more in error--mor disgrac by mis-judg than she actual wa
could the effect of her blunder have been confin to herself

if i had not persuad harriet into like the man i could have
born ani thing he might have doubl hi presumpt to me--
but poor harriet!

how she could have been so deceived!--h protest that he
had never thought serious of harriet--never! she look back
as well as she could; but it wa all confus she had taken
up the idea she suppos and made everi thing bend to it
hi manner howev must have been unmark waver dubiou
or she could not have been so misl

the picture!--how eager he had been about the picture!--
and the charade!--and an hundr other circumstances;--
how clearli they had seem to point at harriet to be sure
the charad with it readi wit--but then the soft eyes--
in fact it suit neither; it wa a jumbl without tast or truth
who could have seen through such thick-head nonsense?

certainli she had often especi of late thought hi manner
to herself unnecessarili gallant; but it had pass as hi way
as a mere error of judgment of knowledg of tast as one proof
among other that he had not alway live in the best societi
that with all the gentl of hi address true eleg
wa sometim wanting; but till thi veri day she had never
for an instant suspect it to mean ani thing but grate respect
to her as harriet friend

to mr john knightley wa she indebt for her first idea on
the subject for the first start of it possibl there wa
no deni that those brother had penetr she rememb
what mr knightley had onc said to her about mr elton the caution
he had given the convict he had profess that mr elton would
never marri indiscreetly; and blush to think how much truer
a knowledg of hi charact had been there shewn than ani she
had reach herself it wa dread mortifying; but mr elton
wa prove himself in mani respect the veri revers of what she
had meant and believ him; proud assum conceited; veri full
of hi own claim and littl concern about the feel of other

contrari to the usual cours of thing mr elton want
to pay hi address to her had sunk him in her opinion
hi profess and hi propos did him no servic she thought
noth of hi attach and wa insult by hi hope
he want to marri well and have the arrog to rais hi
eye to her pretend to be in love; but she wa perfectli easi
as to hi not suffer ani disappoint that need be care for
there had been no real affect either in hi languag or manner
sigh and fine word had been given in abundance; but she could
hardli devis ani set of express or fanci ani tone of voic
less alli with real love she need not troubl herself to piti him
he onli want to aggrandis and enrich himself; and if miss woodhous
of hartfield the heiress of thirti thousand pound were not quit
so easili obtain as he had fanci he would soon tri for miss
somebodi els with twenti or with ten

but--that he should talk of encourag should consid her as
awar of hi view accept hi attent mean (in short)
to marri him!--should suppos himself her equal in connexion
or mind!--look down upon her friend so well understand the
gradat of rank below him and be so blind to what rose abov
as to fanci himself shew no presumpt in address her!--
it wa most provok

perhap it wa not fair to expect him to feel how veri much he
wa her inferior in talent and all the eleg of mind
the veri want of such equal might prevent hi percept of it;
but he must know that in fortun and consequ she wa greatli
hi superior he must know that the woodhous had been settl
for sever gener at hartfield the younger branch
of a veri ancient family--and that the elton were nobodi
the land properti of hartfield certainli wa inconsider
be but a sort of notch in the donwel abbey estat to which all
the rest of highburi belonged; but their fortun from other sourc
wa such as to make them scarc secondari to donwel abbey itself
in everi other kind of consequence; and the woodhous had long
held a high place in the consider of the neighbourhood which
mr elton had first enter not two year ago to make hi way
as he could without ani allianc but in trade or ani thing
to recommend him to notic but hi situat and hi civility--
but he had fanci her in love with him; that evid must
have been hi dependence; and after rave a littl about the
seem incongru of gentl manner and a conceit head
emma wa oblig in common honesti to stop and admit that her own
behaviour to him had been so complais and oblig so full of
courtesi and attent as (suppos her real motiv unperceived)
might warrant a man of ordinari observ and delicaci
like mr elton in fanci himself a veri decid favourit if _she_
had so misinterpret hi feel she had littl right to wonder
that _he_ with self-interest to blind him should have mistaken her

the first error and the worst lay at her door it wa foolish
it wa wrong to take so activ a part in bring ani two
peopl togeth it wa adventur too far assum too much
make light of what ought to be seriou a trick of what ought
to be simpl she wa quit concern and asham and resolv
to do such thing no more

here have i said she actual talk poor harriet into be
veri much attach to thi man she might never have thought of him
but for me; and certainli never would have thought of him with hope
if i had not assur her of hi attach for she is as modest
and humbl as i use to think him oh! that i had been satisfi with
persuad her not to accept young martin there i wa quit right
that wa well done of me; but there i should have stop and left
the rest to time and chanc i wa introduc her into good compani
and give her the opportun of pleas some one worth having;
i ought not to have attempt more but now poor girl her peac
is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her;
and if she were _not_ to feel thi disappoint so veri much i am
sure i have not an idea of ani bodi els who would be at all desir
for her;--william coxe--oh! no i could not endur william coxe--
a pert young lawyer

she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relaps and then resum
a more seriou more dispirit cogit upon what had been
and might be and must be the distress explan she had
to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffer
with the awkward of futur meet the difficulti of
continu or discontinu the acquaint of subdu feel
conceal resent and avoid eclat were enough to occupi
her in most unmirth reflect some time longer and she went
to bed at last with noth settl but the convict of her have
blunder most dread

to youth and natur cheer like emma though under
temporari gloom at night the return of day will hardli fail
to bring return of spirit the youth and cheer of morn
are in happi analog and of power operation; and if the
distress be not poignant enough to keep the eye unclos they
will be sure to open to sensat of soften pain and brighter hope

emma got up on the morrow more dispos for comfort than she had
gone to bed more readi to see allevi of the evil befor her
and to depend on get toler out of it

it wa a great consol that mr elton should not be realli
in love with her or so particularli amiabl as to make it shock
to disappoint him--that harriet natur should not be of that
superior sort in which the feel are most acut and retentive--
and that there could be no necess for ani bodi know
what had pass except the three princip and especi
for her father be given a moment uneasi about it

these were veri cheer thoughts; and the sight of a great deal
of snow on the ground did her further servic for ani thing wa
welcom that might justifi their all three be quit asund
at present

the weather wa most favour for her; though christma day
she could not go to church mr woodhous would have been miser
had hi daughter attempt it and she wa therefor safe from
either excit or receiv unpleas and most unsuit idea
the ground cover with snow and the atmospher in that unsettl
state between frost and thaw which is of all other the most
unfriendli for exercis everi morn begin in rain or snow
and everi even set in to freez she wa for mani day a most
honour prison no intercours with harriet possibl but by note;
no church for her on sunday ani more than on christma day; and no
need to find excus for mr elton absent himself

it wa weather which might fairli confin everi bodi at home;
and though she hope and believ him to be realli take comfort
in some societi or other it wa veri pleasant to have her father
so well satisfi with hi be all alon in hi own hous
too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no
weather could keep entir from them--

ah! mr knightley whi do not you stay at home like poor mr elton?

these day of confin would have been but for her privat
perplex remark comfort as such seclus exactli
suit her brother whose feel must alway be of great import
to hi companions; and he had besid so thoroughli clear off
hi ill-humour at randal that hi amiabl never fail him
dure the rest of hi stay at hartfield he wa alway agreeabl
and oblig and speak pleasantli of everi bodi but with all
the hope of cheer and all the present comfort of delay
there wa still such an evil hang over her in the hour of explan
with harriet as made it imposs for emma to be ever perfectli at eas



chapter xvii


mr and mr john knightley were not detain long at hartfield
the weather soon improv enough for those to move who must move;
and mr woodhous have as usual tri to persuad hi daughter
to stay behind with all her children wa oblig to see the whole
parti set off and return to hi lament over the destini
of poor isabella;--which poor isabella pass her life with
those she doat on full of their merit blind to their fault
and alway innoc busi might have been a model of right
feminin happi

the even of the veri day on which they went brought a note
from mr elton to mr woodhous a long civil ceremoni note
to say with mr elton best compliment that he wa propos
to leav highburi the follow morn in hi way to bath;
where in complianc with the press entreati of some friend
he had engag to spend a few week and veri much regret
the imposs he wa under from variou circumst of
weather and busi of take a person leav of mr woodhous
of whose friendli civil he should ever retain a grate sense--
and had mr woodhous ani command should be happi to attend to them

emma wa most agreeabl surprized--mr elton absenc just
at thi time wa the veri thing to be desir she admir
him for contriv it though not abl to give him much credit
for the manner in which it wa announc resent could not
have been more plainli spoken than in a civil to her father
from which she wa so pointedli exclud she had not even a
share in hi open compliments--h name wa not mentioned;--
and there wa so strike a chang in all thi and such an
ill-judg solemn of leave-tak in hi grace acknowledg
as she thought at first could not escap her father suspicion

it did however--h father wa quit taken up with the surpriz
of so sudden a journey and hi fear that mr elton might never get
safe to the end of it and saw noth extraordinari in hi languag
it wa a veri use note for it suppli them with fresh matter
for thought and convers dure the rest of their lone even
mr woodhous talk over hi alarm and emma wa in spirit
to persuad them away with all her usual promptitud

she now resolv to keep harriet no longer in the dark she had
reason to believ her nearli recov from her cold and it wa
desir that she should have as much time as possibl for get
the better of her other complaint befor the gentleman return
she went to mr goddard accordingli the veri next day to undergo
the necessari penanc of communication; and a sever one it was--
she had to destroy all the hope which she had been so industri
feeding--to appear in the ungraci charact of the one preferred--
and acknowledg herself grossli mistaken and mis-judg in all her
idea on one subject all her observ all her convict
all her propheci for the last six week

the confess complet renew her first shame--and the sight
of harriet tear made her think that she should never be in chariti
with herself again

harriet bore the intellig veri well--blam nobody--
and in everi thing testifi such an ingenu of disposit
and lowli opinion of herself as must appear with particular
advantag at that moment to her friend

emma wa in the humour to valu simplic and modesti to the utmost;
and all that wa amiabl all that ought to be attach
seem on harriet side not her own harriet did not consid
herself as have ani thing to complain of the affect of such
a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction--
she never could have deserv him--and nobodi but so partial
and kind a friend as miss woodhous would have thought it possibl

her tear fell abundantly--but her grief wa so truli artless
that no digniti could have made it more respect in emma eyes--
and she listen to her and tri to consol her with all her heart
and understanding--r for the time convinc that harriet wa
the superior creatur of the two--and that to resembl her would
be more for her own welfar and happi than all that geniu or
intellig could do

it wa rather too late in the day to set about be simple-mind
and ignorant; but she left her with everi previou resolut
confirm of be humbl and discreet and repress imagin
all the rest of her life her second duti now inferior onli to her
father claim wa to promot harriet comfort and endeavour
to prove her own affect in some better method than by match-mak
she got her to hartfield and shew her the most unvari kind
strive to occupi and amus her and by book and convers
to drive mr elton from her thought

time she knew must be allow for thi be thoroughli done; and she
could suppos herself but an indiffer judg of such matter in gener
and veri inadequ to sympathis in an attach to mr elton
in particular; but it seem to her reason that at harriet age
and with the entir extinct of all hope such a progress might be
made toward a state of composur by the time of mr elton return
as to allow them all to meet again in the common routin of acquaint
without ani danger of betray sentiment or increas them

harriet did think him all perfect and maintain the non-exist
of ani bodi equal to him in person or goodness--and did in truth
prove herself more resolut in love than emma had foreseen;
but yet it appear to her so natur so inevit to strive
against an inclin of that sort _unrequited_ that she could not
comprehend it continu veri long in equal forc

if mr elton on hi return made hi own indiffer as evid
and indubit as she could not doubt he would anxious do
she could not imagin harriet persist to place her happi
in the sight or the recollect of him

their be fix so absolut fix in the same place wa bad
for each for all three not one of them had the power of remov
or of effect ani materi chang of societi they must encount
each other and make the best of it

harriet wa farther unfortun in the tone of her companion at
mr goddards; mr elton be the ador of all the teacher
and great girl in the school; and it must be at hartfield onli
that she could have ani chanc of hear him spoken of with cool
moder or repel truth where the wound had been given
there must the cure be found if anywhere; and emma felt that
till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peac
for herself



chapter xviii


mr frank churchil did not come when the time propos
drew near mr weston fear were justifi in the arriv
of a letter of excus for the present he could not be spare
to hi veri great mortif and regret; but still he look
forward with the hope of come to randal at no distant period

mr weston wa exceedingli disappointed--much more disappoint
in fact than her husband though her depend on see the
young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguin temper
though for ever expect more good than occur doe not
alway pay for it hope by ani proportion depress
it soon fli over the present failur and begin to hope again
for half an hour mr weston wa surpriz and sorry; but then he
began to perceiv that frank come two or three month later
would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;
and that he would be abl without ani doubt to stay consider
longer with them than if he had come sooner

these feel rapidli restor hi comfort while mr weston
of a more apprehens disposit foresaw noth but a repetit
of excus and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband
wa to suffer suffer a great deal more herself

emma wa not at thi time in a state of spirit to care realli
about mr frank churchil not come except as a disappoint
at randal the acquaint at present had no charm for her
she want rather to be quiet and out of temptation; but still as it
wa desir that she should appear in gener like her usual self
she took care to express as much interest in the circumst
and enter as warmli into mr and mr weston disappoint
as might natur belong to their friendship

she wa the first to announc it to mr knightley; and exclaim
quit as much as wa necessari (or be act a part perhap
rather more) at the conduct of the churchil in keep him away
she then proceed to say a good deal more than she felt of the
advantag of such an addit to their confin societi in surry;
the pleasur of look at somebodi new; the gala-day to highburi entir
which the sight of him would have made; and end with reflect
on the churchil again found herself directli involv in a
disagr with mr knightley; and to her great amus
perceiv that she wa take the other side of the question from her
real opinion and make use of mr weston argument against herself

the churchil are veri like in fault said mr knightley
coolly; but i dare say he might come if he would

i do not know whi you should say so he wish exceedingli to come;
but hi uncl and aunt will not spare him

i cannot believ that he ha not the power of come if he made
a point of it it is too unlik for me to believ it without proof

how odd you are! what ha mr frank churchil done to make you
suppos him such an unnatur creature?

i am not suppos him at all an unnatur creatur in suspect
that he may have learnt to be abov hi connexion and to care
veri littl for ani thing but hi own pleasur from live with
those who have alway set him the exampl of it it is a great deal
more natur than one could wish that a young man brought up
by those who are proud luxuri and selfish should be proud
luxuri and selfish too if frank churchil had want to see
hi father he would have contriv it between septemb and januari
a man at hi age--what is he?--thre or four-and-twenty--cannot be
without the mean of do as much as that it is imposs

that easili said and easili felt by you who have alway
been your own master you are the worst judg in the world
mr knightley of the difficulti of depend you do not know
what it is to have temper to manag

it is not to be conceiv that a man of three or four-and-twenti
should not have liberti of mind or limb to that amount he cannot
want money--h cannot want leisur we know on the contrari
that he ha so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at
the idlest haunt in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some
watering-plac or other a littl while ago he wa at weymouth
thi prove that he can leav the churchil

ye sometim he can

and those time are whenev he think it worth hi while;
whenev there is ani temptat of pleasur

it is veri unfair to judg of ani bodi conduct without an
intim knowledg of their situat nobodi who ha not been
in the interior of a famili can say what the difficulti
of ani individu of that famili may be we ought to be
acquaint with enscomb and with mr churchil temper
befor we pretend to decid upon what her nephew can do
he may at time be abl to do a great deal more than he can at other

there is one thing emma which a man can alway do if he chuse
and that is hi duty; not by manoeuvr and finess but by vigour
and resolut it is frank churchil duti to pay thi attent
to hi father he know it to be so by hi promis and messages;
but if he wish to do it it might be done a man who felt rightli
would say at onc simpli and resolut to mr churchill--
`everi sacrific of mere pleasur you will alway find me readi to make
to your convenience; but i must go and see my father immedi
i know he would be hurt by my fail in such a mark of respect to him
on the present occas i shall therefor set off to-morrow--
if he would say so to her at onc in the tone of decis becom
a man there would be no opposit made to hi go

no said emma laughing; but perhap there might be some made to hi
come back again such languag for a young man entir depend
to use!--nobodi but you mr knightley would imagin it possibl
but you have not an idea of what is requisit in situat directli
opposit to your own mr frank churchil to be make such
a speech as that to the uncl and aunt who have brought him up
and are to provid for him!--stand up in the middl of the room
i suppos and speak as loud as he could!--how can you imagin
such conduct practicable?

depend upon it emma a sensibl man would find no difficulti in it
he would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--mad
of cours as a man of sens would make it in a proper manner--
would do him more good rais him higher fix hi interest stronger
with the peopl he depend on than all that a line of shift
and expedi can ever do respect would be ad to affect
they would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had
done rightli by hi father would do rightli by them; for they know
as well as he doe as well as all the world must know that he
ought to pay thi visit to hi father; and while meanli exert
their power to delay it are in their heart not think the better
of him for submit to their whim respect for right conduct
is felt by everi bodi if he would act in thi sort of manner
on principl consist regularli their littl mind would bend
to hi

i rather doubt that you are veri fond of bend littl minds;
but where littl mind belong to rich peopl in author
i think they have a knack of swell out till they are quit as
unmanag as great one i can imagin that if you as you are
mr knightley were to be transport and place all at onc in
mr frank churchil situat you would be abl to say and do
just what you have been recommend for him; and it might have
a veri good effect the churchil might not have a word to say
in return; but then you would have no habit of earli obedi
and long observ to break through to him who ha it might
not be so easi to burst forth at onc into perfect independ
and set all their claim on hi gratitud and regard at nought
he may have as strong a sens of what would be right as you can have
without be so equal under particular circumst to act up
to it

then it would not be so strong a sens if it fail to produc
equal exert it could not be an equal convict

oh the differ of situat and habit! i wish you would tri
to understand what an amiabl young man may be like to feel
in directli oppos those whom as child and boy he ha been
look up to all hi life

our amiabl young man is a veri weak young man if thi be the first
occas of hi carri through a resolut to do right against
the will of other it ought to have been a habit with him by
thi time of follow hi duti instead of consult expedi
i can allow for the fear of the child but not of the man
as he becam ration he ought to have rous himself and shaken off
all that wa unworthi in their author he ought to have oppos
the first attempt on their side to make him slight hi father
had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulti now

we shall never agre about him cri emma; but that is
noth extraordinari i have not the least idea of hi be
a weak young man: i feel sure that he is not mr weston would
not be blind to folli though in hi own son; but he is veri like
to have a more yield compli mild disposit than would suit
your notion of man perfect i dare say he has; and though
it may cut him off from some advantag it will secur him mani other

yes; all the advantag of sit still when he ought to move
and of lead a life of mere idl pleasur and fanci himself
extrem expert in find excus for it he can sit down and
write a fine flourish letter full of profess and falsehood
and persuad himself that he ha hit upon the veri best method
in the world of preserv peac at home and prevent hi father
have ani right to complain hi letter disgust me

your feel are singular they seem to satisfi everi bodi els

i suspect they do not satisfi mr weston they hardli can
satisfi a woman of her good sens and quick feelings: stand in
a mother place but without a mother affect to blind her
it is on her account that attent to randal is doubli due
and she must doubli feel the omiss had she been a person
of consequ herself he would have come i dare say; and it would
not have signifi whether he did or no can you think your friend
behindhand in these sort of considerations? do you suppos she
doe not often say all thi to herself? no emma your amiabl
young man can be amiabl onli in french not in english he may be
veri `aimabl have veri good manner and be veri agreeable; but he
can have no english delicaci toward the feel of other people:
noth realli amiabl about him

you seem determin to think ill of him

me!--not at all repli mr knightley rather displeased; i do
not want to think ill of him i should be as readi to acknowledg
hi merit as ani other man; but i hear of none except what are
mere personal; that he is well-grown and good-look with smooth
plausibl manner

well if he have noth els to recommend him he will be a
treasur at highburi we do not often look upon fine young men
well-br and agreeabl we must not be nice and ask for all
the virtu into the bargain cannot you imagin mr knightley
what a _sensation_ hi come will produce? there will be but one subject
throughout the parish of donwel and highbury; but one interest--
one object of curiosity; it will be all mr frank churchill;
we shall think and speak of nobodi els

you will excus my be so much over-pow if i find him
convers i shall be glad of hi acquaintance; but if he is onli
a chatter coxcomb he will not occupi much of my time or thought

my idea of him is that he can adapt hi convers to the tast
of everi bodi and ha the power as well as the wish of be
univers agreeabl to you he will talk of farming; to me
of draw or music; and so on to everi bodi have that gener
inform on all subject which will enabl him to follow the lead
or take the lead just as proprieti may requir and to speak
extrem well on each; that is my idea of him

and mine said mr knightley warmli is that if he turn out ani
thing like it he will be the most insuffer fellow breathing!
what! at three-and-twenti to be the king of hi company--th great man--
the practis politician who is to read everi bodi charact
and make everi bodi talent conduc to the display of hi
own superiority; to be dispens hi flatteri around that he
may make all appear like fool compar with himself! my dear emma
your own good sens could not endur such a puppi when it came
to the point

i will say no more about him cri emma you turn everi
thing to evil we are both prejudiced; you against i for him;
and we have no chanc of agre till he is realli here

prejudiced! i am not prejud

but i am veri much and without be at all asham of it
my love for mr and mr weston give me a decid prejudic in
hi favour

he is a person i never think of from one month end to anoth
said mr knightley with a degre of vexat which made emma
immedi talk of someth els though she could not comprehend
whi he should be angri

to take a dislik to a young man onli becaus he appear to be
of a differ disposit from himself wa unworthi the real
liber of mind which she wa alway use to acknowledg in him;
for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid
to hi charg she had never befor for a moment suppos it could
make him unjust to the merit of anoth

emma and harriet had been walk togeth one morn and
in emma opinion had been talk enough of mr elton for that day
she could not think that harriet solac or her own sin requir more;
and she wa therefor industri get rid of the subject
as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she
had succeed and after speak some time of what the poor must
suffer in winter and receiv no other answer than a veri plaintive--
mr elton is so good to the poor! she found someth els must be done

they were just approach the hous where live mr and miss bate
she determin to call upon them and seek safeti in number
there wa alway suffici reason for such an attention; mr and
miss bate love to be call on and she knew she wa consid
by the veri few who presum ever to see imperfect in her
as rather neglig in that respect and as not contribut what she
ought to the stock of their scanti comfort

she had had mani a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart
as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuas
of it be veri disagreeable--a wast of time--tiresom women--
and all the horror of be in danger of fall in with the second-r
and third-rat of highburi who were call on them for ever
and therefor she seldom went near them but now she made the sudden
resolut of not pass their door without go in--observ
as she propos it to harriet that as well as she could calcul
they were just now quit safe from ani letter from jane fairfax

the hous belong to peopl in busi mr and miss bate occupi
the drawing-room floor; and there in the veri moderate-s apart
which wa everi thing to them the visitor were most cordial
and even grate welcomed; the quiet neat old ladi who with her
knit wa seat in the warmest corner want even to give up
her place to miss woodhous and her more activ talk daughter
almost readi to overpow them with care and kind thank for
their visit solicitud for their shoe anxiou inquiri after
mr woodhous health cheer commun about her mother
and sweet-cak from the beaufet--mr cole had just been there
just call in for ten minut and had been so good as to sit an
hour with them and _she_ had taken a piec of cake and been so kind
as to say she like it veri much; and therefor she hope miss
woodhous and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piec too

the mention of the cole wa sure to be follow by that of mr elton
there wa intimaci between them and mr cole had heard from
mr elton sinc hi go away emma knew what wa coming; they must
have the letter over again and settl how long he had been gone
and how much he wa engag in compani and what a favourit he
wa wherev he went and how full the master of the ceremoni
ball had been; and she went through it veri well with all the
interest and all the commend that could be requisit and alway
put forward to prevent harriet be oblig to say a word

thi she had been prepar for when she enter the house;
but meant have onc talk him handsom over to be no farther
incommod by ani troublesom topic and to wander at larg amongst
all the mistress and miss of highburi and their card-parti
she had not been prepar to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton;
but he wa actual hurri off by miss bate she jump away
from him at last abruptli to the cole to usher in a letter from
her niec

oh! yes--mr elton i understand--certainli as to dancing--
mr cole wa tell me that danc at the room at bath was--
mr cole wa so kind as to sit some time with us talk of jane;
for as soon as she came in she began inquir after her
jane is so veri great a favourit there whenev she is with us
mr cole doe not know how to shew her kind enough;
and i must say that jane deserv it as much as ani bodi can
and so she began inquir after her directli say `i know you
cannot have heard from jane late becaus it is not her time
for writing; and when i immedi said `but inde we have
we had a letter thi veri morn i do not know that i ever saw
ani bodi more surpriz `have you upon your honour? said she;
`well that is quit unexpect do let me hear what she say

emma polit wa at hand directli to say with smile interest--

have you heard from miss fairfax so lately? i am extrem happi
i hope she is well?

thank you you are so kind! repli the happili deceiv aunt
while eagerli hunt for the letter--oh! here it is i wa sure
it could not be far off; but i had put my huswif upon it you see
without be awar and so it wa quit hid but i had it in my hand
so veri late that i wa almost sure it must be on the tabl
i wa read it to mr cole and sinc she went away i wa
read it again to my mother for it is such a pleasur to her--
a letter from jane--that she can never hear it often enough;
so i knew it could not be far off and here it is onli just under
my huswife--and sinc you are so kind as to wish to hear what
she says;--but first of all i realli must in justic to jane
apologis for her write so short a letter--onli two page you see--
hardli two--and in gener she fill the whole paper and cross half
my mother often wonder that i can make it out so well
she often say when the letter is first open `well hetti
now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work--
dont you maam?--and then i tell her i am sure she would contriv
to make it out herself if she had nobodi to do it for her--
everi word of it--i am sure she would pore over it till she had
made out everi word and inde though my mother eye are not
so good as they were she can see amazingli well still thank god!
with the help of spectacl it is such a blessing! my mother
are realli veri good inde jane often say when she is here
`i am sure grandmama you must have had veri strong eye to see
as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--i onli wish
my eye may last me as well

all thi spoken extrem fast oblig miss bate to stop for breath;
and emma said someth veri civil about the excel of miss
fairfax handwrit

you are extrem kind repli miss bate highli gratified;
you who are such a judg and write so beauti yourself
i am sure there is nobodi prais that could give us so much pleasur
as miss woodhous my mother doe not hear; she is a littl deaf
you know maam address her do you hear what miss woodhous
is so oblig to say about jane handwriting?

and emma had the advantag of hear her own silli compliment
repeat twice over befor the good old ladi could comprehend it
she wa ponder in the meanwhil upon the possibl without seem
veri rude of make her escap from jane fairfax letter and had
almost resolv on hurri away directli under some slight excus
when miss bate turn to her again and seiz her attent

my mother deaf is veri trifl you see--just noth at all
by onli rais my voic and say ani thing two or three time over
she is sure to hear; but then she is use to my voic but it is veri
remark that she should alway hear jane better than she doe me
jane speak so distinct! howev she will not find her grandmama
at all deafer than she wa two year ago; which is say a great
deal at my mother time of life--and it realli is full two year
you know sinc she wa here we never were so long without see
her befor and as i wa tell mr cole we shall hardli know
how to make enough of her now

are you expect miss fairfax here soon?

oh yes; next week

indeed!--that must be a veri great pleasur

thank you you are veri kind ye next week everi bodi is
so surprized; and everi bodi say the same oblig thing i am
sure she will be as happi to see her friend at highburi as they
can be to see her ye friday or saturday; she cannot say which
becaus colonel campbel will be want the carriag himself one
of those day so veri good of them to send her the whole way!
but they alway do you know oh ye friday or saturday next
that is what she write about that is the reason of her write out
of rule as we call it; for in the common cours we should not have
heard from her befor next tuesday or wednesday

ye so i imagin i wa afraid there could be littl chanc
of my hear ani thing of miss fairfax to-day

so oblig of you! no we should not have heard if it had not
been for thi particular circumst of her be to come here
so soon my mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three month
with us at least three month she say so posit as i
am go to have the pleasur of read to you the case is
you see that the campbel are go to ireland mr dixon ha
persuad her father and mother to come over and see her directli
they had not intend to go over till the summer but she is so
impati to see them again--for till she marri last octob
she wa never away from them so much as a week which must make
it veri strang to be in differ kingdom i wa go to say
but howev differ countri and so she wrote a veri urgent letter
to her mother--or her father i declar i do not know which it wa
but we shall see present in jane letter--wrot in mr dixon
name as well as her own to press their come over directli
and they would give them the meet in dublin and take them back
to their countri seat baly-craig a beauti place i fanci
jane ha heard a great deal of it beauty; from mr dixon i mean--
i do not know that she ever heard about it from ani bodi else;
but it wa veri natur you know that he should like to speak
of hi own place while he wa pay hi addresses--and as jane use
to be veri often walk out with them--for colonel and mr campbel
were veri particular about their daughter not walk out
often with onli mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them;
of cours she heard everi thing he might be tell miss campbel
about hi own home in ireland; and i think she wrote us word
that he had shewn them some draw of the place view that he
had taken himself he is a most amiabl charm young man
i believ jane wa quit long to go to ireland from hi account
of thing

at thi moment an ingeni and anim suspicion enter
emma brain with regard to jane fairfax thi charm mr dixon
and the not go to ireland she said with the insidi design
of farther discoveri

you must feel it veri fortun that miss fairfax should be allow
to come to you at such a time consid the veri particular
friendship between her and mr dixon you could hardli have expect
her to be excus from accompani colonel and mr campbel

veri true veri true inde the veri thing that we have alway
been rather afraid of; for we should not have like to have her
at such a distanc from us for month together--not abl to come
if ani thing wa to happen but you see everi thing turn out
for the best they want her (mr and mr dixon) excess to
come over with colonel and mr campbell; quit depend upon it;
noth can be more kind or press than their _joint_ invit
jane say as you will hear presently; mr dixon doe not seem in the
least backward in ani attent he is a most charm young man
ever sinc the servic he render jane at weymouth when they were
out in that parti on the water and she by the sudden whirl
round of someth or other among the sail would have been dash
into the sea at onc and actual wa all but gone if he had not
with the greatest presenc of mind caught hold of her habit--
(i can never think of it without trembling!)--but ever sinc we
had the histori of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon!

but in spite of all her friend urgenc and her own wish
of see ireland miss fairfax prefer devot the time to you
and mr bates?

yes--entir her own do entir her own choice; and colonel
and mr campbel think she doe quit right just what they
should recommend; and inde they particularli _wish_ her to tri
her nativ air as she ha not been quit so well as usual late

i am concern to hear of it i think they judg wise
but mr dixon must be veri much disappoint mr dixon
i understand ha no remark degre of person beauty; is not
by ani mean to be compar with miss fairfax

oh! no you are veri oblig to say such things--but certainli not
there is no comparison between them miss campbel alway wa
absolut plain--but extrem eleg and amiabl

ye that of cours

jane caught a bad cold poor thing! so long ago as the 7th
of novemb (a i am go to read to you) and ha never been
well sinc a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her?
she never mention it befor becaus she would not alarm us
just like her! so considerate!--but howev she is so far from well
that her kind friend the campbel think she had better come home
and tri an air that alway agre with her; and they have no doubt
that three or four month at highburi will entir cure her--
and it is certainli a great deal better that she should come here
than go to ireland if she is unwel nobodi could nurs her as we
should do

it appear to me the most desir arrang in the world

and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the
campbel leav town in their way to holyhead the monday following--
as you will find from jane letter so sudden!--y may guess
dear miss woodhous what a flurri it ha thrown me in!
if it wa not for the drawback of her illness--but i am afraid
we must expect to see her grown thin and look veri poorli
i must tell you what an unlucki thing happen to me as to that
i alway make a point of read jane letter through to myself first
befor i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there
be ani thing in them to distress her jane desir me to do it
so i alway do: and so i began to-day with my usual caution;
but no sooner did i come to the mention of her be unwel than i
burst out quit frighten with `bless me! poor jane is ill!--
which my mother be on the watch heard distinctli and wa sadli
alarm at howev when i read on i found it wa not near so bad
as i had fanci at first; and i make so light of it now to her
that she doe not think much about it but i cannot imagin
how i could be so off my guard if jane doe not get well soon
we will call in mr perri the expens shall not be thought of;
and though he is so liber and so fond of jane that i dare say
he would not mean to charg ani thing for attend we could not
suffer it to be so you know he ha a wife and famili to maintain
and is not to be give away hi time well now i have just given you
a hint of what jane write about we will turn to her letter and i am
sure she tell her own stori a great deal better than i can tell it
for her

i am afraid we must be run away said emma glanc at harriet
and begin to rise--mi father will be expect us
i had no intent i thought i had no power of stay more than
five minut when i first enter the hous i mere call
becaus i would not pass the door without inquir after mr bates;
but i have been so pleasantli detained! now howev we must wish
you and mr bate good morn

and not all that could be urg to detain her succeed
she regain the street--happi in thi that though much had been
forc on her against her will though she had in fact heard
the whole substanc of jane fairfax letter she had been abl
to escap the letter itself



chapter ii


jane fairfax wa an orphan the onli child of mr batess
youngest daughter

the marriag of lieut fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantri
and miss jane bate had had it day of fame and pleasur
hope and interest; but noth now remain of it save the melancholi
remembr of him die in action abroad--of hi widow sink
under consumpt and grief soon afterwards--and thi girl

by birth she belong to highbury: and when at three year old
on lose her mother she becam the properti the charg
the consol the fondl of her grandmoth and aunt there had
seem everi probabl of her be perman fix there;
of her be taught onli what veri limit mean could command
and grow up with no advantag of connexion or improv
to be engraft on what natur had given her in a pleas person
good understand and warm-heart well-mean relat

but the compassion feel of a friend of her father gave
a chang to her destini thi wa colonel campbel who had
veri highli regard fairfax as an excel offic and most
deserv young man; and farther had been indebt to him for
such attent dure a sever camp-fev as he believ had save
hi life these were claim which he did not learn to overlook
though some year pass away from the death of poor fairfax
befor hi own return to england put ani thing in hi power
when he did return he sought out the child and took notic of her
he wa a marri man with onli one live child a girl
about jane age: and jane becam their guest pay them long visit
and grow a favourit with all; and befor she wa nine year old
hi daughter great fond for her and hi own wish of be
a real friend unit to produc an offer from colonel campbel
of undertak the whole charg of her educ it wa accepted;
and from that period jane had belong to colonel campbel famili
and had live with them entir onli visit her grandmoth
from time to time

the plan wa that she should be brought up for educ others;
the veri few hundr pound which she inherit from her father
make independ imposs to provid for her otherwis
wa out of colonel campbel power; for though hi incom by pay
and appoint wa handsom hi fortun wa moder and must
be all hi daughters; but by give her an educ he hope
to be suppli the mean of respect subsist hereaft

such wa jane fairfax histori she had fallen into good hand
known noth but kind from the campbel and been given
an excel educ live constantli with right-mind
and well-inform peopl her heart and understand had receiv
everi advantag of disciplin and culture; and colonel campbel
resid be in london everi lighter talent had been done
full justic to by the attend of first-rat master
her disposit and abil were equal worthi of all that
friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she wa as far
as such an earli age can be qualifi for the care of children
fulli compet to the offic of instruct herself; but she
wa too much belov to be part with neither father nor mother
could promot and the daughter could not endur it the evil day
wa put off it wa easi to decid that she wa still too young;
and jane remain with them share as anoth daughter in all
the ration pleasur of an eleg societi and a judici
mixtur of home and amus with onli the drawback of the futur
the sober suggest of her own good understand to remind
her that all thi might soon be over

the affect of the whole famili the warm attach of miss
campbel in particular wa the more honour to each parti
from the circumst of jane decid superior both in beauti
and acquir that natur had given it in featur could not
be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher power of mind
be unfelt by the parent they continu togeth with unab
regard howev till the marriag of miss campbel who by that chanc
that luck which so often defi anticip in matrimoni affair
give attract to what is moder rather than to what is superior
engag the affect of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeabl
almost as soon as they were acquainted; and wa elig
and happili settl while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn

thi event had veri late taken place; too late for ani thing to be
yet attempt by her less fortun friend toward enter on her path
of duty; though she had now reach the age which her own judgment
had fix on for begin she had long resolv that one-and-twenti
should be the period with the fortitud of a devot noviti
she had resolv at one-and-twenti to complet the sacrific
and retir from all the pleasur of life of ration intercours
equal societi peac and hope to penanc and mortif for ever

the good sens of colonel and mr campbel could not oppos such
a resolut though their feel did as long as they live
no exert would be necessari their home might be her for ever;
and for their own comfort they would have retain her wholly;
but thi would be selfishness:--what must be at last had better
be soon perhap they began to feel it might have been kinder
and wiser to have resist the temptat of ani delay and spare
her from a tast of such enjoy of eas and leisur as must
now be relinquish still howev affect wa glad to catch
at ani reason excus for not hurri on the wretch moment
she had never been quit well sinc the time of their daughter marriage;
and till she should have complet recov her usual strength
they must forbid her engag in duti which so far from be
compat with a weaken frame and vari spirit seem
under the most favour circumst to requir someth
more than human perfect of bodi and mind to be discharg with
toler comfort

with regard to her not accompani them to ireland her account
to her aunt contain noth but truth though there might be some
truth not told it wa her own choic to give the time of their
absenc to highbury; to spend perhap her last month of perfect
liberti with those kind relat to whom she wa so veri dear:
and the campbel whatev might be their motiv or motiv
whether singl or doubl or trebl gave the arrang
their readi sanction and said that they depend more on a few
month spent in her nativ air for the recoveri of her health
than on ani thing els certain it wa that she wa to come;
and that highburi instead of welcom that perfect novelti which
had been so long promis it--mr frank churchill--must put up for
the present with jane fairfax who could bring onli the fresh
of a two year absenc

emma wa sorry;--to have to pay civil to a person she did
not like through three long months!--to be alway do more than
she wish and less than she ought! whi she did not like jane
fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; mr knightley
had onc told her it wa becaus she saw in her the realli
accomplish young woman which she want to be thought herself;
and though the accus had been eagerli refut at the time
there were moment of self-examin in which her conscienc could
not quit acquit her but she could never get acquaint with her:
she did not know how it wa but there wa such cold and reserve--
such appar indiffer whether she pleas or not--and then
her aunt wa such an etern talker!--and she wa made such a fuss
with by everi body!--and it had been alway imagin that they were
to be so intimate--becaus their age were the same everi bodi had
suppos they must be so fond of each other these were her reasons--
she had no better

it wa a dislik so littl just--everi imput fault wa so magnifi
by fanci that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after ani
consider absenc without feel that she had injur her;
and now when the due visit wa paid on her arriv after a two year
interv she wa particularli struck with the veri appear
and manner which for those two whole year she had been depreci
jane fairfax wa veri eleg remark elegant; and she had
herself the highest valu for eleg her height wa pretti
just such as almost everi bodi would think tall and nobodi could
think veri tall; her figur particularli graceful; her size a most
becom medium between fat and thin though a slight appear
of ill-health seem to point out the likeliest evil of the two
emma could not but feel all this; and then her face--h features--
there wa more beauti in them altogeth than she had remembered;
it wa not regular but it wa veri pleas beauti her eye
a deep grey with dark eye-lash and eyebrow had never been deni
their praise; but the skin which she had been use to cavil at
as want colour had a clear and delicaci which realli need
no fuller bloom it wa a style of beauti of which eleg
wa the reign charact and as such she must in honour
by all her principl admir it:--eleg which whether of person
or of mind she saw so littl in highburi there not to be vulgar
wa distinct and merit

in short she sat dure the first visit look at jane fairfax
with twofold complacency; the sens of pleasur and the sens
of render justic and wa determin that she would dislik
her no longer when she took in her histori inde her situat
as well as her beauty; when she consid what all thi eleg
wa destin to what she wa go to sink from how she wa go
to live it seem imposs to feel ani thing but compass
and respect; especi if to everi well-known particular entitl
her to interest were ad the highli probabl circumst
of an attach to mr dixon which she had so natur start
to herself in that case noth could be more pitiabl
or more honour than the sacrific she had resolv on
emma wa veri will now to acquit her of have seduc
mr dixon action from hi wife or of ani thing mischiev
which her imagin had suggest at first if it were love
it might be simpl singl successless love on her side alon
she might have been unconsci suck in the sad poison
while a sharer of hi convers with her friend; and from the best
the purest of motiv might now be deni herself thi visit
to ireland and resolv to divid herself effectu from
him and hi connexion by soon begin her career of labori duti

upon the whole emma left her with such soften charit feel
as made her look around in walk home and lament that highburi
afford no young man worthi of give her independence;
nobodi that she could wish to scheme about for her

these were charm feelings--but not last befor she had
commit herself by ani public profess of etern friendship for
jane fairfax or done more toward a recant of past prejudic
and error than say to mr knightley she certainli is handsome;
she is better than handsome! jane had spent an even at hartfield
with her grandmoth and aunt and everi thing wa relaps much
into it usual state former provoc reappear the aunt
wa as tiresom as ever; more tiresom becaus anxieti for her
health wa now ad to admir of her powers; and they had to
listen to the descript of exactli how littl bread and butter
she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner
as well as to see exhibit of new cap and new workbag for her
mother and herself; and jane offenc rose again they had music;
emma wa oblig to play; and the thank and prais which necessarili
follow appear to her an affect of candour an air
of great mean onli to shew off in higher style her own veri
superior perform she wa besid which wa the worst of all
so cold so cautious! there wa no get at her real opinion
wrapt up in a cloak of polit she seem determin
to hazard noth she wa disgustingli wa suspici reserv

if ani thing could be more where all wa most she wa more
reserv on the subject of weymouth and the dixon than ani thing
she seem bent on give no real insight into mr dixon charact
or her own valu for hi compani or opinion of the suitabl
of the match it wa all gener approb and smoothness;
noth delin or distinguish it did her no servic howev
her caution wa thrown away emma saw it artific and return
to her first surmis there probabl _was_ someth more to conceal
than her own preference; mr dixon perhap had been veri near
chang one friend for the other or been fix onli to miss campbel
for the sake of the futur twelv thousand pound

the like reserv prevail on other topic she and mr frank churchil
had been at weymouth at the same time it wa known that they were
a littl acquainted; but not a syllabl of real inform could emma
procur as to what he truli wa wa he handsome?--sh believ
he wa reckon a veri fine young man wa he agreeable?--
he wa gener thought so did he appear a sensibl young man;
a young man of information?--at a watering-plac or in a common
london acquaint it wa difficult to decid on such point
manner were all that could be safe judg of under a much longer
knowledg than they had yet had of mr churchil she believ
everi bodi found hi manner pleas emma could not forgiv her



chapter iii


emma could not forgiv her;--but as neither provoc nor resent
were discern by mr knightley who had been of the parti and had
seen onli proper attent and pleas behaviour on each side
he wa express the next morn be at hartfield again on
busi with mr woodhous hi approb of the whole; not so
openli as he might have done had her father been out of the room
but speak plain enough to be veri intellig to emma
he had been use to think her unjust to jane and had now great
pleasur in mark an improv

a veri pleasant even he began as soon as mr woodhous
had been talk into what wa necessari told that he understood
and the paper swept away;--particularli pleasant you and miss
fairfax gave us some veri good music i do not know a more
luxuri state sir than sit at one eas to be entertain
a whole even by two such young women; sometim with music
and sometim with convers i am sure miss fairfax must
have found the even pleasant emma you left noth undon
i wa glad you made her play so much for have no instrument
at her grandmoth it must have been a real indulg

i am happi you approv said emma smiling; but i hope i am
not often defici in what is due to guest at hartfield

no my dear said her father instantly; _that_ i am sure you
are not there is nobodi half so attent and civil as you are
if ani thing you are too attent the muffin last night--if it
had been hand round onc i think it would have been enough

no said mr knightley nearli at the same time; you are not
often deficient; not often defici either in manner or comprehens
i think you understand me therefor

an arch look expressed--i understand you well enough; but she
said onli miss fairfax is reserv

i alway told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcom
all that part of her reserv which ought to be overcom all that
ha it foundat in diffid what aris from discret
must be honour

you think her diffid i do not see it

my dear emma said he move from hi chair into one close
by her you are not go to tell me i hope that you
had not a pleasant even

oh! no; i wa pleas with my own persever in ask questions;
and amus to think how littl inform i obtain

i am disappoint wa hi onli answer

i hope everi bodi had a pleasant even said mr woodhous
in hi quiet way i had onc i felt the fire rather too much;
but then i move back my chair a littl a veri littl and it did
not disturb me miss bate wa veri chatti and good-humour
as she alway is though she speak rather too quick howev
she is veri agreeabl and mr bate too in a differ way
i like old friends; and miss jane fairfax is a veri pretti sort of
young ladi a veri pretti and a veri well-behav young ladi inde
she must have found the even agreeabl mr knightley becaus she
had emma

true sir; and emma becaus she had miss fairfax

emma saw hi anxieti and wish to appeas it at least for
the present said and with a sincer which no one could question--

she is a sort of eleg creatur that one cannot keep one eye from
i am alway watch her to admire; and i do piti her from my heart

mr knightley look as if he were more gratifi than he care
to express; and befor he could make ani repli mr woodhous
whose thought were on the batess said--

it is a great piti that their circumst should be so confined!
a great piti indeed! and i have often wished--but it is so littl one
can ventur to do--smal trifl present of ani thing uncommon--
now we have kill a porker and emma think of send them
a loin or a leg; it is veri small and delicate--hartfield pork is
not like ani other pork--but still it is pork--and my dear emma
unless one could be sure of their make it into steak nice fri
as our are fri without the smallest greas and not roast it
for no stomach can bear roast pork--i think we had better send the leg--
do not you think so my dear?

my dear papa i sent the whole hind-quart i knew you would wish it
there will be the leg to be salt you know which is so veri nice
and the loin to be dress directli in ani manner they like

that right my dear veri right i had not thought of it befor
but that is the best way they must not over-salt the leg; and then
if it is not over-salt and if it is veri thoroughli boil
just as serl boil our and eaten veri moder of with a
boil turnip and a littl carrot or parsnip i do not consid
it unwholesom

miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard
of perfect in highburi both in person and mind

an interest in thi news you who have been hear and see
so much of late on these subject who must have been so deep
in the busi on miss campbel account--w shall not excus
your be indiffer about mr elton and miss hawkin

when i have seen mr elton repli jane i dare say i
shall be interested--but i believ it requir _that_ with me
and as it is some month sinc miss campbel marri the impress
may be a littl worn off

ye he ha been gone just four week as you observ miss woodhous
said miss bate four week yesterday--a miss hawkins!--wel i had
alway rather fanci it would be some young ladi hereabouts;
not that i ever--mr cole onc whisper to me--but i immedi said
`no mr elton is a most worthi young man--but--in short i do
not think i am particularli quick at those sort of discoveri
i do not pretend to it what is befor me i see at the same time
nobodi could wonder if mr elton should have aspired--miss woodhous
let me chatter on so good-humouredli she know i would not

is not strictli speak handsome?

handsome! oh! no--far from it--certainli plain i told you he
wa plain

my dear you said that miss campbel would not allow him to be plain
and that you yourself--

oh! as for me my judgment is worth noth where i have a regard
i alway think a person well-look but i gave what i believ
the gener opinion when i call him plain

well my dear jane i believ we must be run away
the weather doe not look well and grandmama will be uneasi
you are too oblig my dear miss woodhouse; but we realli must
take leav thi ha been a most agreeabl piec of news inde

and jane you had better go home directly--i would not have you
out in a shower!--w think she is the better for highburi alreadi

my dear sir oh! mr knightley is come too well that is
so very!--i am sure if jane is tire you will be so kind as to
give her your arm--mr elton and miss hawkins!--good morn
to you

emma alon with her father had half her attent want by him
while he lament that young peopl would be in such a hurri to marry--
and to marri stranger too--and the other half she could give
to her own view of the subject it wa to herself an amus
and a veri welcom piec of news as prove that mr elton
could not have suffer long; but she wa sorri for harriet:
harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope wa by give
the first inform herself to save her from hear it abruptli
from other it wa now about the time that she wa like to call
if she were to meet miss bate in her way!--and upon it begin
to rain emma wa oblig to expect that the weather would be
detain her at mr goddard and that the intellig would
undoubtedli rush upon her without prepar

the shower wa heavi but short; and it had not been over five minut
when in came harriet with just the heat agit look which
hurri thither with a full heart wa like to give; and the
oh! miss woodhous what do you think ha happened! which instantli
burst forth had all the evid of correspond perturb
as the blow wa given emma felt that she could not now shew greater
kind than in listening; and harriet uncheck ran eagerli
through what she had to tell she had set out from mr goddard
half an hour ago--sh had been afraid it would rain--sh had been
afraid it would pour down everi moment--but she thought she might
get to hartfield first--sh had hurri on as fast as possible;
but then as she wa pass by the hous where a young woman
wa make up a gown for her she thought she would just step
in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay
half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain
and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directli as fast
as she could and took shelter at fords--ford wa the princip
woollen-drap linen-drap and haberdash shop united;
the shop first in size and fashion in the place--and so
there she had set without an idea of ani thing in the world
full ten minut perhaps--when all of a sudden who should come in--
to be sure it wa so veri odd!--but they alway dealt at fords--
who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother!--
dear miss woodhouse! onli think i thought i should have faint
i did not know what to do i wa sit near the door--elizabeth saw
me directly; but he did not; he wa busi with the umbrella
i am sure she saw me but she look away directli and took
no notice; and they both went to quit the farther end of the shop;
and i kept sit near the door!--oh! dear; i wa so miserable!
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away
you know becaus of the rain; but i did so wish myself anywher
in the world but there--oh! dear miss woodhouse--wel at last
i fanci he look round and saw me; for instead of go
on with her buy they began whisper to one anoth
i am sure they were talk of me; and i could not help think
that he wa persuad her to speak to me--(do you think he wa
miss woodhouse?)--for present she came forward--cam quit up
to me and ask me how i did and seem readi to shake hand
if i would she did not do ani of it in the same way that she used;
i could see she wa altered; but howev she seem to _try_ to be
veri friendli and we shook hand and stood talk some time;
but i know no more what i said--i wa in such a tremble!--i rememb
she said she wa sorri we never met now; which i thought almost
too kind! dear miss woodhous i wa absolut miserable!
by that time it wa begin to hold up and i wa determin
that noth should stop me from get away--and then--onli think!--
i found he wa come up toward me too--slowli you know and as
if he did not quit know what to do; and so he came and spoke
and i answered--and i stood for a minut feel dread
you know one cant tell how; and then i took courag and said it
did not rain and i must go; and so off i set; and i had not got
three yard from the door when he came after me onli to say
if i wa go to hartfield he thought i had much better go round
by mr cole stabl for i should find the near way quit float
by thi rain oh! dear i thought it would have been the death of me!
so i said i wa veri much oblig to him: you know i could
not do less; and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round
by the stables--i believ i did--but i hardli knew where i wa
or ani thing about it oh! miss woodhous i would rather done
ani thing than have it happen: and yet you know there wa a sort
of satisfact in see him behav so pleasantli and so kindli
and elizabeth too oh! miss woodhous do talk to me and make
me comfort again

veri sincer did emma wish to do so; but it wa not immedi in
her power she wa oblig to stop and think she wa not thoroughli
comfort herself the young man conduct and hi sister
seem the result of real feel and she could not but piti them
as harriet describ it there had been an interest mixtur
of wound affect and genuin delicaci in their behaviour
but she had believ them to be well-mean worthi peopl before;
and what differ did thi make in the evil of the connexion?
it wa folli to be disturb by it of cours he must be sorri
to lose her--they must be all sorri ambit as well as love
had probabl been mortifi they might all have hope to rise
by harriet acquaintance: and besid what wa the valu of
harriet description?--so easili pleased--so littl discerning;--
what signifi her praise?

she exert herself and did tri to make her comfort
by consid all that had pass as a mere trifl and quit
unworthi of be dwelt on

it might be distress for the moment said she; but you seem
to have behav extrem well; and it is over--and may never--
can never as a first meet occur again and therefor you need
not think about it

harriet said veri true and she would not think about it;
but still she talk of it--stil she could talk of noth else;
and emma at last in order to put the martin out of her head
wa oblig to hurri on the news which she had meant to give
with so much tender caution; hardli know herself whether
to rejoic or be angri asham or onli amus at such a state
of mind in poor harriet--such a conclus of mr elton import
with her!

mr elton right howev gradual reviv though she did not
feel the first intellig as she might have done the day befor
or an hour befor it interest soon increased; and befor their
first convers wa over she had talk herself into all the
sensat of curios wonder and regret pain and pleasur
as to thi fortun miss hawkin which could conduc to place
the martin under proper subordin in her fanci

emma learn to be rather glad that there had been such a meet
it had been servic in deaden the first shock without retain
ani influenc to alarm as harriet now live the martin could
not get at her without seek her where hitherto they had want
either the courag or the condescens to seek her; for sinc her
refus of the brother the sister never had been at mr goddards;
and a twelvemonth might pass without their be thrown togeth again
with ani necess or even ani power of speech



chapter iv


human natur is so well dispos toward those who are in
interest situat that a young person who either marri
or die is sure of be kindli spoken of

a week had not pass sinc miss hawkinss name wa first
mention in highburi befor she wa by some mean or other
discov to have everi recommend of person and mind;
to be handsom eleg highli accomplish and perfectli amiable:
and when mr elton himself arriv to triumph in hi happi prospect
and circul the fame of her merit there wa veri littl more
for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose
music she princip play

mr elton return a veri happi man he had gone away reject
and mortified--disappoint in a veri sanguin hope after a seri
of what appear to him strong encouragement; and not onli lose
the right ladi but find himself debas to the level of a veri
wrong one he had gone away deepli offended--h came back engag
to another--and to anoth as superior of cours to the first
as under such circumst what is gain alway is to what is lost
he came back gay and self-satisfi eager and busi care noth
for miss woodhous and defi miss smith

the charm augusta hawkin in addit to all the usual advantag
of perfect beauti and merit wa in possess of an independ fortun
of so mani thousand as would alway be call ten; a point of
some digniti as well as some convenience: the stori told well;
he had not thrown himself away--h had gain a woman of 10000 l
or thereabouts; and he had gain her with such delight rapidity--
the first hour of introduct had been so veri soon follow by
distinguish notice; the histori which he had to give mr cole
of the rise and progress of the affair wa so glorious--th step
so quick from the accident rencontr to the dinner at mr green
and the parti at mr browns--smil and blush rise in importance--
with conscious and agit richli scattered--th ladi
had been so easili impressed--so sweetli disposed--had in short
to use a most intellig phrase been so veri readi to have him
that vaniti and prudenc were equal content

he had caught both substanc and shadow--both fortun and affect
and wa just the happi man he ought to be; talk onli of himself
and hi own concerns--expect to be congratulated--readi to be
laugh at--and with cordial fearless smile now address
all the young ladi of the place to whom a few week ago
he would have been more cautious gallant

the wed wa no distant event as the parti had onli themselv
to pleas and noth but the necessari prepar to wait for;
and when he set out for bath again there wa a gener expect
which a certain glanc of mr cole did not seem to contradict
that when he next enter highburi he would bring hi bride

dure hi present short stay emma had bare seen him; but just
enough to feel that the first meet wa over and to give her
the impress of hi not be improv by the mixtur of piqu
and pretens now spread over hi air she wa in fact
begin veri much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleas
at all; and hi sight wa so insepar connect with some veri
disagre feel that except in a moral light as a penanc
a lesson a sourc of profit humili to her own mind
she would have been thank to be assur of never see him again
she wish him veri well; but he gave her pain and hi welfar
twenti mile off would administ most satisfact

the pain of hi continu resid in highburi howev must certainli
be lessen by hi marriag mani vain solicitud would be prevented--
mani awkward smooth by it a _mrs_ _elton_ would be an excus for
ani chang of intercourse; former intimaci might sink without remark
it would be almost begin their life of civil again

of the ladi individu emma thought veri littl she wa good
enough for mr elton no doubt; accomplish enough for highbury--
handsom enough--to look plain probabl by harriet side
as to connexion there emma wa perfectli easy; persuad
that after all hi own vaunt claim and disdain of harriet
he had done noth on that articl truth seem attain
_what_ she wa must be uncertain; but _who_ she wa might be found out;
and set asid the 10000 l it did not appear that she wa at
all harriet superior she brought no name no blood no allianc
miss hawkin wa the youngest of the two daughter of a bristol--
merchant of cours he must be called; but as the whole of the
profit of hi mercantil life appear so veri moder it wa
not unfair to guess the digniti of hi line of trade had been veri
moder also part of everi winter she had been use to spend in bath;
but bristol wa her home the veri heart of bristol; for though
the father and mother had die some year ago an uncl remained--
in the law line--noth more distinctli honour wa hazard
of him than that he wa in the law line; and with him the daughter
had live emma guess him to be the drudg of some attorney
and too stupid to rise and all the grandeur of the connexion
seem depend on the elder sister who wa _very_ _well_ _married_
to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ near bristol who kept two carriages!
that wa the wind-up of the history; that wa the glori of
miss hawkin

could she but have given harriet her feel about it all!
she had talk her into love; but alas! she wa not so easili to be
talk out of it the charm of an object to occupi the mani vacanc
of harriet mind wa not to be talk away he might be supersed
by another; he certainli would indeed; noth could be clearer;
even a robert martin would have been sufficient; but noth els
she fear would cure her harriet wa one of those who
have onc begun would be alway in love and now poor girl!
she wa consider wors from thi reappear of mr elton
she wa alway have a glimps of him somewher or other emma saw
him onli once; but two or three time everi day harriet wa sure
_just_ to meet with him or _just_ to miss him _just_ to hear hi voic
or see hi shoulder _just_ to have someth occur to preserv him
in her fanci in all the favour warmth of surpriz and conjectur
she wa moreov perpetu hear about him; for except when
at hartfield she wa alway among those who saw no fault in mr elton
and found noth so interest as the discuss of hi concerns;
and everi report therefor everi guess--al that had alreadi
occur all that might occur in the arrang of hi affair
comprehend incom servant and furnitur wa continu
in agit around her her regard wa receiv strength by
invari prais of him and her regret kept aliv and feel
irrit by ceaseless repetit of miss hawkinss happi
and continu observ of how much he seem attached!--
hi air as he walk by the house--th veri sit of hi hat
be all in proof of how much he wa in love!

had it been allow entertain had there been no pain
to her friend or reproach to herself in the waver of
harriet mind emma would have been amus by it variat
sometim mr elton predomin sometim the martins; and each
wa occasion use as a check to the other mr elton
engag had been the cure of the agit of meet mr martin
the unhappi produc by the knowledg of that engag had been
a littl put asid by elizabeth martin call at mr goddard
a few day afterward harriet had not been at home; but a note had
been prepar and left for her written in the veri style to touch;
a small mixtur of reproach with a great deal of kindness;
and till mr elton himself appear she had been much occupi
by it continu ponder over what could be done in return
and wish to do more than she dare to confess but mr elton
in person had driven away all such care while he staid
the martin were forgotten; and on the veri morn of hi set off
for bath again emma to dissip some of the distress it occas
judg it best for her to return elizabeth martin visit

how that visit wa to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--
and what might be safest had been a point of some doubt
consider absolut neglect of the mother and sister
when invit to come would be ingratitud it must not be:
and yet the danger of a renew of the acquaintance!--

after much think she could determin on noth better than harriet
return the visit; but in a way that if they had understand
should convinc them that it wa to be onli a formal acquaint
she meant to take her in the carriag leav her at the abbey mill
while she drove a littl farther and call for her again so soon
as to allow no time for insidi applic or danger
recurr to the past and give the most decid proof of what
degre of intimaci wa chosen for the futur

she could think of noth better: and though there wa someth
in it which her own heart could not approve--someth of ingratitud
mere gloss over--it must be done or what would becom of harriet?



chapter v


small heart had harriet for visit onli half an hour befor her
friend call for her at mr goddard her evil star had led
her to the veri spot where at that moment a trunk direct to
_the_ _rev_ _philip_ _elton_ _white-hart_ _bath_ wa to be seen under the
oper of be lift into the butcher cart which wa to
convey it to where the coach past; and everi thing in thi world
except that trunk and the direct wa consequ a blank

she went however; and when they reach the farm and she wa to
be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led
between espali apple-tre to the front door the sight of everi
thing which had given her so much pleasur the autumn befor
wa begin to reviv a littl local agitation; and when they part
emma observ her to be look around with a sort of fear curios
which determin her not to allow the visit to exceed the propos
quarter of an hour she went on herself to give that portion
of time to an old servant who wa marri and settl in donwel

the quarter of an hour brought her punctual to the white gate again;
and miss smith receiv her summon wa with her without delay
and unattend by ani alarm young man she came solitarili
down the gravel walk--a miss martin just appear at the door
and part with her seemingli with ceremoni civil

harriet could not veri soon give an intellig account
she wa feel too much; but at last emma collect from her
enough to understand the sort of meet and the sort of pain it
wa creat she had seen onli mr martin and the two girl
they had receiv her doubtingli if not coolly; and noth
beyond the merest commonplac had been talk almost all the time--
till just at last when mr martin say all of a sudden
that she thought miss smith wa grown had brought on a more
interest subject and a warmer manner in that veri room
she had been measur last septemb with her two friend
there were the pencil mark and memorandum on the wainscot by
the window _he_ had done it they all seem to rememb the day
the hour the parti the occasion--to feel the same conscious
the same regrets--to be readi to return to the same good understanding;
and they were just grow again like themselv (harriet as emma
must suspect as readi as the best of them to be cordial and happy)
when the carriag reappear and all wa over the style of
the visit and the short of it were then felt to be decis
fourteen minut to be given to those with whom she had thank
pass six week not six month ago!--emma could not but pictur
it all and feel how justli they might resent how natur
harriet must suffer it wa a bad busi she would have given
a great deal or endur a great deal to have had the martin
in a higher rank of life they were so deserv that a _little_
higher should have been enough: but as it wa how could she have
done otherwise?--impossible!--sh could not repent they must
be separated; but there wa a great deal of pain in the process--
so much to herself at thi time that she soon felt the necess
of a littl consol and resolv on go home by way of randal
to procur it her mind wa quit sick of mr elton and the martin
the refresh of randal wa absolut necessari

it wa a good scheme; but on drive to the door they heard
that neither master nor mistress wa at home; they had both
been out some time; the man believ they were gone to hartfield

thi is too bad cri emma as they turn away and now we
shall just miss them; too provoking!--i do not know when i have been
so disappoint and she lean back in the corner to indulg
her murmur or to reason them away; probabl a littl of both--
such be the commonest process of a not ill-dispos mind
present the carriag stopt; she look up; it wa stopt
by mr and mr weston who were stand to speak to her
there wa instant pleasur in the sight of them and still greater
pleasur wa convey in sound--for mr weston immedi accost
her with

how dye do?--how dye do?--w have been sit with your father--
glad to see him so well frank come to-morrow--i had a letter
thi morning--w see him to-morrow by dinner-tim to a certainty--
he is at oxford to-day and he come for a whole fortnight; i knew it would
be so if he had come at christma he could not have staid three days;
i wa alway glad he did not come at christmas; now we are go
to have just the right weather for him fine dri settl weather
we shall enjoy him completely; everi thing ha turn out exactli
as we could wish

there wa no resist such news no possibl of avoid the
influenc of such a happi face as mr weston confirm as it all
wa by the word and the counten of hi wife fewer and quieter
but not less to the purpos to know that _she_ thought hi come
certain wa enough to make emma consid it so and sincer did
she rejoic in their joy it wa a most delight reanim
of exhaust spirit the worn-out past wa sunk in the fresh
of what wa coming; and in the rapid of half a moment thought
she hope mr elton would now be talk of no more

mr weston gave her the histori of the engag at enscomb
which allow hi son to answer for have an entir fortnight at
hi command as well as the rout and the method of hi journey;
and she listen and smile and congratul

i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclus

emma could imagin she saw a touch of the arm at thi speech
from hi wife

we had better move on mr weston said she we are detain
the girl

well well i am ready;--and turn again to emma but you must
not be expect such a _very_ fine young man; you have onli had _my_
account you know; i dare say he is realli noth extraordinary:--
though hi own sparkl eye at the moment were speak a veri
differ convict

emma could look perfectli unconsci and innoc and answer
in a manner that appropri noth

think of me to-morrow my dear emma about four oclock
wa mr weston part injunction; spoken with some anxieti
and meant onli for her

four oclock!--depend upon it he will be here by three wa mr weston
quick amendment; and so end a most satisfactori meet
emma spirit were mount quit up to happiness; everi thing wore
a differ air; jame and hi hors seem not half so sluggish
as befor when she look at the hedg she thought the elder at
least must soon be come out; and when she turn round to harriet
she saw someth like a look of spring a tender smile even there

will mr frank churchil pass through bath as well as oxford?--
wa a question howev which did not augur much

but neither geographi nor tranquil could come all at onc
and emma wa now in a humour to resolv that they should both come
in time

the morn of the interest day arriv and mr weston
faith pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelv
oclock that she wa to think of her at four

my dear dear anxiou friend--said she in mental soliloquy
while walk downstair from her own room alway overcar
for everi bodi comfort but your own; i see you now in all your
littl fidget go again and again into hi room to be sure
that all is right the clock struck twelv as she pass through
the hall ti twelve; i shall not forget to think of you four
hour hence; and by thi time to-morrow perhap or a littl later
i may be think of the possibl of their all call here
i am sure they will bring him soon

she open the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sit with
her father--mr weston and hi son they had been arriv onli
a few minut and mr weston had scarc finish hi explan
of frank be a day befor hi time and her father wa yet
in the midst of hi veri civil welcom and congratul when
she appear to have her share of surpriz introduct and pleasur

the frank churchil so long talk of so high in interest
wa actual befor her--h wa present to her and she did
not think too much had been said in hi praise; he wa a _very_ good
look young man; height air address all were unexception
and hi counten had a great deal of the spirit and liveli
of hi fathers; he look quick and sensibl she felt immedi
that she should like him; and there wa a well-br eas of manner
and a readi to talk which convinc her that he came intend
to be acquaint with her and that acquaint they soon must be

he had reach randal the even befor she wa pleas
with the eager to arriv which had made him alter hi plan
and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half
a day

i told you yesterday cri mr weston with exult i told
you all that he would be here befor the time name i rememb
what i use to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey;
one cannot help get on faster than one ha planned; and the
pleasur of come in upon one friend befor the look-out begin
is worth a great deal more than ani littl exert it need

it is a great pleasur where one can indulg in it said the young man
though there are not mani hous that i should presum on so far;
but in come _home_ i felt i might do ani thing

the word _home_ made hi father look on him with fresh complac
emma wa directli sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;
the convict wa strengthen by what follow he wa veri much
pleas with randal thought it a most admir arrang hous
would hardli allow it even to be veri small admir the situat
the walk to highburi highburi itself hartfield still more
and profess himself to have alway felt the sort of interest
in the countri which none but one _own_ countri give and the
greatest curios to visit it that he should never have been
abl to indulg so amiabl a feel befor pass suspici
through emma brain; but still if it were a falsehood it wa a
pleasant one and pleasantli handl hi manner had no air of studi
or exagger he did realli look and speak as if in a state of no
common enjoy

their subject in gener were such as belong to an open acquaint
on hi side were the inquiries--wa she a horsewoman?--pleas rides?--
pleasant walks?--had they a larg neighbourhood?--highburi perhap
afford societi enough?--ther were sever veri pretti hous
in and about it--balls--had they balls?--wa it a music society?

but when satisfi on all these point and their acquaint
proportion advanc he contriv to find an opportun
while their two father were engag with each other of introduc
hi mother-in-law and speak of her with so much handsom prais
so much warm admir so much gratitud for the happi she
secur to hi father and her veri kind recept of himself
as wa an addit proof of hi know how to please--
and of hi certainli think it worth while to tri to pleas her
he did not advanc a word of prais beyond what she knew to be
thoroughli deserv by mr weston; but undoubtedli he could know
veri littl of the matter he understood what would be welcome;
he could be sure of littl els hi father marriag he said
had been the wisest measur everi friend must rejoic in it;
and the famili from whom he had receiv such a bless must
be ever consid as have confer the highest oblig
on him

he got as near as he could to thank her for miss taylor merit
without seem quit to forget that in the common cours of thing it
wa to be rather suppos that miss taylor had form miss woodhous
charact than miss woodhous miss taylor and at last as if resolv
to qualifi hi opinion complet for travel round to it object he
wound it all up with astonish at the youth and beauti of her person

eleg agreeabl manner i wa prepar for said he;
but i confess that consid everi thing i had not expect
more than a veri toler well-look woman of a certain age;
i did not know that i wa to find a pretti young woman in mr weston

you cannot see too much perfect in mr weston for my feel
said emma; were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ i should listen
with pleasure; but _she_ would be readi to quarrel with you for use
such word dont let her imagin that you have spoken of her as
a pretti young woman

i hope i should know better he replied; no depend upon it
(with a gallant bow) that in address mr weston i should
understand whom i might prais without ani danger of be thought
extravag in my term

emma wonder whether the same suspicion of what might be expect
from their know each other which had taken strong possess
of her mind had ever cross his; and whether hi compliment were
to be consid as mark of acquiesc or proof of defianc
she must see more of him to understand hi ways; at present she
onli felt they were agreeabl

she had no doubt of what mr weston wa often think about
hi quick eye she detect again and again glanc toward them
with a happi expression; and even when he might have determin not
to look she wa confid that he wa often listen

her own father perfect exempt from ani thought of the kind
the entir defici in him of all such sort of penetr
or suspicion wa a most comfort circumst happili he
wa not farther from approv matrimoni than from forese it--
though alway object to everi marriag that wa arrang
he never suffer beforehand from the apprehens of any;
it seem as if he could not think so ill of ani two person
understand as to suppos they meant to marri till it were
prove against them she bless the favour blind
he could now without the drawback of a singl unpleas surmis
without a glanc forward at ani possibl treacheri in hi guest
give way to all hi natur kind-heart civil in solicit
inquiri after mr frank churchil accommod on hi journey
through the sad evil of sleep two night on the road and express
veri genuin unmix anxieti to know that he had certainli escap
catch cold--which howev he could not allow him to feel quit
assur of himself till after anoth night

a reason visit paid mr weston began to move--h must be go
he had busi at the crown about hi hay and a great mani errand
for mr weston at ford but he need not hurri ani bodi els
hi son too well bred to hear the hint rose immedi also
say

as you are go farther on busi sir i will take the
opportun of pay a visit which must be paid some day or other
and therefor may as well be paid now i have the honour of be
acquaint with a neighbour of your (turn to emma) a ladi
resid in or near highbury; a famili of the name of fairfax
i shall have no difficulti i suppos in find the house;
though fairfax i believ is not the proper name--i should rather
say barn or bate do you know ani famili of that name?

to be sure we do cri hi father; mr bates--w pass her house--
i saw miss bate at the window true true you are acquaint
with miss fairfax; i rememb you knew her at weymouth and a fine
girl she is call upon her by all mean

there is no necess for my call thi morn said the
young man; anoth day would do as well; but there wa that degre
of acquaint at weymouth which--

oh! go to-day go to-day do not defer it what is right to be done
cannot be done too soon and besid i must give you a hint frank;
ani want of attent to her _here_ should be care avoid
you saw her with the campbel when she wa the equal of everi bodi
she mix with but here she is with a poor old grandmoth
who ha bare enough to live on if you do not call earli it
will be a slight

the son look convinc

i have heard her speak of the acquaint said emma; she is
a veri eleg young woman

he agre to it but with so quiet a ye as inclin her almost
to doubt hi real concurrence; and yet there must be a veri distinct
sort of eleg for the fashion world if jane fairfax could
be thought onli ordinarili gift with it

if you were never particularli struck by her manner befor
said she i think you will to-day you will see her to advantage;
see her and hear her--no i am afraid you will not hear her at all
for she ha an aunt who never hold her tongu

you are acquaint with miss jane fairfax sir are you?
said mr woodhous alway the last to make hi way in conversation;
then give me leav to assur you that you will find her a veri
agreeabl young ladi she is stay here on a visit to her grandmama
and aunt veri worthi people; i have known them all my life
they will be extrem glad to see you i am sure; and one of my
servant shall go with you to shew you the way

my dear sir upon no account in the world; my father can direct me

but your father is not go so far; he is onli go to the crown
quit on the other side of the street and there are a great mani houses;
you might be veri much at a loss and it is a veri dirti walk
unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you
where you had best cross the street

mr frank churchil still declin it look as seriou as he could
and hi father gave hi hearti support by call out my good friend
thi is quit unnecessary; frank know a puddl of water when he
see it and as to mr batess he may get there from the crown
in a hop step and jump

they were permit to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one
and a grace bow from the other the two gentlemen took leav
emma remain veri well pleas with thi begin of the acquaint
and could now engag to think of them all at randal ani hour of
the day with full confid in their comfort



chapter vi


the next morn brought mr frank churchil again he came with
mr weston to whom and to highburi he seem to take veri cordial
he had been sit with her it appear most companion at home
till her usual hour of exercise; and on be desir to chuse
their walk immedi fix on highbury--h did not doubt there
be veri pleasant walk in everi direct but if left to him
he should alway chuse the same highburi that airi cheer
happy-look highburi would be hi constant attraction--
highburi with mr weston stood for hartfield; and she trust to
it bear the same construct with him they walk thither directli

emma had hardli expect them: for mr weston who had call in
for half a minut in order to hear that hi son wa veri handsom
knew noth of their plans; and it wa an agreeabl surpriz
to her therefor to perceiv them walk up to the hous togeth
arm in arm she wa want to see him again and especi
to see him in compani with mr weston upon hi behaviour to whom
her opinion of him wa to depend if he were defici there
noth should make amend for it but on see them togeth
she becam perfectli satisfi it wa not mere in fine word
or hyperbol compliment that he paid hi duty; noth could be
more proper or pleas than hi whole manner to her--noth could
more agreeabl denot hi wish of consid her as a friend and
secur her affect and there wa time enough for emma to form a
reason judgment as their visit includ all the rest of the morn
they were all three walk about togeth for an hour or two--
first round the shrubberi of hartfield and afterward in highburi
he wa delight with everi thing; admir hartfield suffici
for mr woodhous ear; and when their go farther wa resolv on
confess hi wish to be made acquaint with the whole villag
and found matter of commend and interest much often than emma
could have suppos

some of the object of hi curios spoke veri amiabl feel
he beg to be shewn the hous which hi father had live in so long
and which had been the home of hi father father; and on recollect
that an old woman who had nurs him wa still live walk in quest
of her cottag from one end of the street to the other; and though
in some point of pursuit or observ there wa no posit merit
they shew altogeth a good-wil toward highburi in gener
which must be veri like a merit to those he wa with

emma watch and decid that with such feel as were now shewn
it could not be fairli suppos that he had been ever voluntarili
absent himself; that he had not been act a part or make
a parad of insincer professions; and that mr knightley certainli
had not done him justic

their first paus wa at the crown inn an inconsider hous
though the princip one of the sort where a coupl of pair of
post-hors were kept more for the conveni of the neighbourhood
than from ani run on the road; and hi companion had not expect
to be detain by ani interest excit there; but in pass it they
gave the histori of the larg room visibl added; it had been built
mani year ago for a ball-room and while the neighbourhood had been
in a particularli popul danc state had been occasion use
as such;--but such brilliant day had long pass away and now the
highest purpos for which it wa ever want wa to accommod a whist
club establish among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place
he wa immedi interest it charact as a ball-room caught him;
and instead of pass on he stopt for sever minut at the two
superior sash window which were open to look in and contempl
it capabl and lament that it origin purpos should
have ceas he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledg
none which they suggest no it wa long enough broad enough
handsom enough it would hold the veri number for comfort
they ought to have ball there at least everi fortnight through
the winter whi had not miss woodhous reviv the former good
old day of the room?--sh who could do ani thing in highbury!
the want of proper famili in the place and the convict
that none beyond the place and it immedi environ could be
tempt to attend were mentioned; but he wa not satisfi
he could not be persuad that so mani good-look hous as he saw
around him could not furnish number enough for such a meeting;
and even when particular were given and famili describ he wa
still unwil to admit that the inconveni of such a mixtur
would be ani thing or that there would be the smallest difficulti
in everi bodi return into their proper place the next morn
he argu like a young man veri much bent on dancing; and emma
wa rather surpriz to see the constitut of the weston prevail
so decidedli against the habit of the churchil he seem to have
all the life and spirit cheer feel and social inclin
of hi father and noth of the pride or reserv of enscomb
of pride inde there wa perhap scarc enough; hi indiffer
to a confus of rank border too much on ineleg of mind
he could be no judg howev of the evil he wa hold cheap
it wa but an effus of live spirit

at last he wa persuad to move on from the front of the crown;
and be now almost face the hous where the bates lodg
emma recollect hi intend visit the day befor and ask him
if he had paid it

ye oh! yes--h replied; i wa just go to mention it
a veri success visit:--i saw all the three ladies; and felt veri
much oblig to you for your preparatori hint if the talk aunt
had taken me quit by surpriz it must have been the death of me
as it wa i wa onli betray into pay a most unreason visit
ten minut would have been all that wa necessari perhap all that
wa proper; and i had told my father i should certainli be at home
befor him--but there wa no get away no pause; and to my
utter astonish i found when he (find me nowher else)
join me there at last that i had been actual sit with them
veri nearli three-quart of an hour the good ladi had not given me
the possibl of escap befor

and how did you think miss fairfax looking?

ill veri ill--that is if a young ladi can ever be allow to look ill
but the express is hardli admiss mr weston is it?
ladi can never look ill and serious miss fairfax is natur
so pale as almost alway to give the appear of ill health--
a most deplor want of complexion

emma would not agre to thi and began a warm defenc of miss
fairfax complexion it wa certainli never brilliant but she
would not allow it to have a sickli hue in general; and there wa
a soft and delicaci in her skin which gave peculiar eleg
to the charact of her face he listen with all due deference;
acknowledg that he had heard mani peopl say the same--but yet he
must confess that to him noth could make amend for the want
of the fine glow of health where featur were indiffer
a fine complexion gave beauti to them all; and where they were good
the effect was--fortun he need not attempt to describ what the
effect wa

well said emma there is no disput about taste--at least
you admir her except her complexion

he shook hi head and laughed--i cannot separ miss fairfax
and her complexion

did you see her often at weymouth? were you often in the same society?

at thi moment they were approach ford and he hastili exclaim
ha! thi must be the veri shop that everi bodi attend everi day
of their live as my father inform me he come to highburi himself
he say six day out of the seven and ha alway busi at ford
if it be not inconveni to you pray let us go in that i may prove
myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highburi
i must buy someth at ford it will be take out my freedom--
i dare say they sell glove

oh! ye glove and everi thing i do admir your patriot
you will be ador in highburi you were veri popular befor you came
becaus you were mr weston son--but lay out half a guinea at
ford and your popular will stand upon your own virtu

they went in; and while the sleek well-ti parcel of men beaver
and york tan were bring down and display on the counter
he said--but i beg your pardon miss woodhous you were speak
to me you were say someth at the veri moment of thi burst
of my _amor_ _patriae_ do not let me lose it i assur you the utmost
stretch of public fame would not make me amend for the loss of ani
happi in privat life

i mere ask whether you had known much of miss fairfax
and her parti at weymouth

and now that i understand your question i must pronounc it to be a
veri unfair one it is alway the ladi right to decid on the degre
of acquaint miss fairfax must alreadi have given her account--
i shall not commit myself by claim more than she may chuse to allow

upon my word! you answer as discreetli as she could do herself
but her account of everi thing leav so much to be guess
she is so veri reserv so veri unwil to give the least
inform about ani bodi that i realli think you may say what you
like of your acquaint with her

may i indeed?--then i will speak the truth and noth suit me
so well i met her frequent at weymouth i had known the campbel
a littl in town; and at weymouth we were veri much in the same set
colonel campbel is a veri agreeabl man and mr campbel a friendli
warm-heart woman i like them all

you know miss fairfax situat in life i conclude; what she
is destin to be?

yes--(rath hesitatingly)--i believ i do

you get upon delic subject emma said mr weston smiling;
rememb that i am here--mr frank churchil hardli know
what to say when you speak of miss fairfax situat in life
i will move a littl farther off

i certainli do forget to think of _her_ said emma as have ever
been ani thing but my friend and my dearest friend

he look as if he fulli understood and honour such a sentiment

when the glove were bought and they had quit the shop again
did you ever hear the young ladi we were speak of play?
said frank churchil

ever hear her! repeat emma you forget how much she belong
to highburi i have heard her everi year of our live sinc we
both began she play charmingli

you think so do you?--i want the opinion of some one who
could realli judg she appear to me to play well that is
with consider tast but i know noth of the matter myself--
i am excess fond of music but without the smallest skill
or right of judg of ani bodi performance--i have been use
to hear her admired; and i rememb one proof of her be
thought to play well:--a man a veri music man and in love
with anoth woman--engag to her--on the point of marriage--
would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument
if the ladi in question could sit down instead--nev seem
to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought
in a man of known music talent wa some proof

proof indeed! said emma highli amused--mr dixon is veri music
is he? we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you
than miss fairfax would have vouchsaf in half a year

ye mr dixon and miss campbel were the persons; and i thought
it a veri strong proof

certainly--veri strong it was; to own the truth a great deal
stronger than if _i_ had been miss campbel would have been at all
agreeabl to me i could not excus a man have more music
than love--mor ear than eye--a more acut sensibl to fine
sound than to my feel how did miss campbel appear to like it?

it wa her veri particular friend you know

poor comfort! said emma laugh one would rather have a stranger
prefer than one veri particular friend--with a stranger it might
not recur again--but the miseri of have a veri particular friend
alway at hand to do everi thing better than one doe oneself!--
poor mr dixon! well i am glad she is gone to settl in ireland

you are right it wa not veri flatter to miss campbell;
but she realli did not seem to feel it

so much the better--or so much the worse:--i do not know which
but be it sweet or be it stupid in her--quick of friendship
or dul of feeling--ther wa one person i think who must have
felt it: miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improp
and danger distinct

as to that--i do not--

oh! do not imagin that i expect an account of miss fairfax
sensat from you or from ani bodi els they are known to no
human be i guess but herself but if she continu to play
whenev she wa ask by mr dixon one may guess what one chuse

there appear such a perfectli good understand among them all--
he began rather quickli but check himself ad howev it
is imposs for me to say on what term they realli were--
how it might all be behind the scene i can onli say that there
wa smooth outwardli but you who have known miss fairfax from
a child must be a better judg of her charact and of how she
is like to conduct herself in critic situat than i can be

i have known her from a child undoubtedly; we have been children
and women together; and it is natur to suppos that we should
be intimate--that we should have taken to each other whenev
she visit her friend but we never did i hardli know how it
ha happened; a littl perhap from that wicked on my side
which wa prone to take disgust toward a girl so idol
and so cri up as she alway wa by her aunt and grandmoth
and all their set and then her reserve--i never could attach
myself to ani one so complet reserv

it is a most repuls qualiti inde said he oftentim
veri conveni no doubt but never pleas there is safeti
in reserv but no attract one cannot love a reserv person

not till the reserv ceas toward oneself; and then the attract
may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend
or an agreeabl companion than i have yet been to take
the troubl of conquer ani bodi reserv to procur one
intimaci between miss fairfax and me is quit out of the question
i have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that
such extrem and perpetu cautious of word and manner
such a dread of give a distinct idea about ani bodi is apt
to suggest suspicion of there be someth to conceal

he perfectli agre with her: and after walk togeth so long
and think so much alik emma felt herself so well acquaint with him
that she could hardli believ it to be onli their second meet
he wa not exactli what she had expected; less of the man of the
world in some of hi notion less of the spoil child of fortun
therefor better than she had expect hi idea seem more moderate--
hi feel warmer she wa particularli struck by hi manner
of consid mr elton hous which as well as the church
he would go and look at and would not join them in find much
fault with no he could not believ it a bad house; not such a hous
as a man wa to be piti for have if it were to be share with
the woman he love he could not think ani man to be piti for have
that hous there must be ampl room in it for everi real comfort
the man must be a blockhead who want more

mr weston laugh and said he did not know what he wa talk about
use onli to a larg hous himself and without ever think how mani
advantag and accommod were attach to it size he could
be no judg of the privat inevit belong to a small one
but emma in her own mind determin that he _did_ know what he
wa talk about and that he shew a veri amiabl inclin
to settl earli in life and to marri from worthi motiv
he might not be awar of the inroad on domest peac to be
occas by no housekeep room or a bad butler pantri
but no doubt he did perfectli feel that enscomb could not make
him happi and that whenev he were attach he would willingli
give up much of wealth to be allow an earli establish



chapter vii


emma veri good opinion of frank churchil wa a littl shaken
the follow day by hear that he wa gone off to london
mere to have hi hair cut a sudden freak seem to have seiz him
at breakfast and he had sent for a chais and set off intend to
return to dinner but with no more import view that appear than
have hi hair cut there wa certainli no harm in hi travel
sixteen mile twice over on such an errand; but there wa an air
of fopperi and nonsens in it which she could not approv it did
not accord with the ration of plan the moder in expens
or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believ herself
to discern in him yesterday vaniti extravag love of chang
restless of temper which must be do someth good or bad;
heedless as to the pleasur of hi father and mr weston
indiffer as to how hi conduct might appear in general; he becam
liabl to all these charg hi father onli call him a coxcomb
and thought it a veri good story; but that mr weston did not like it
wa clear enough by her pass it over as quickli as possibl
and make no other comment than that all young peopl would have
their littl whim

with the except of thi littl blot emma found that hi visit
hitherto had given her friend onli good idea of him mr weston
wa veri readi to say how attent and pleasant a companion he
made himself--how much she saw to like in hi disposit altogeth
he appear to have a veri open temper--certainli a veri cheer
and live one; she could observ noth wrong in hi notion
a great deal decidedli right; he spoke of hi uncl with warm regard
wa fond of talk of him--said he would be the best man in the
world if he were left to himself; and though there wa no be
attach to the aunt he acknowledg her kind with gratitud
and seem to mean alway to speak of her with respect
thi wa all veri promising; and but for such an unfortun fanci
for have hi hair cut there wa noth to denot him unworthi
of the distinguish honour which her imagin had given him;
the honour if not of be realli in love with her of be
at least veri near it and save onli by her own indifference--
(for still her resolut held of never marrying)--th honour in short
of be mark out for her by all their joint acquaint

mr weston on hi side ad a virtu to the account which must
have some weight he gave her to understand that frank admir
her extremely--thought her veri beauti and veri charming;
and with so much to be said for him altogeth she found she must
not judg him harshli as mr weston observ all young peopl
would have their littl whim

there wa one person among hi new acquaint in surri not so
lenient dispos in gener he wa judg throughout the parish
of donwel and highburi with great candour; liber allow
were made for the littl excess of such a handsom young man--
one who smile so often and bow so well; but there wa one spirit
among them not to be soften from it power of censur by bow
or smiles--mr knightley the circumst wa told him at hartfield;
for the moment he wa silent; but emma heard him almost immedi
afterward say to himself over a newspap he held in hi hand
hum! just the trifl silli fellow i took him for she had
half a mind to resent; but an instant observ convinc
her that it wa realli said onli to reliev hi own feel
and not meant to provoke; and therefor she let it pass

although in one instanc the bearer of not good tide
mr and mr weston visit thi morn wa in anoth respect
particularli opportun someth occur while they were
at hartfield to make emma want their advice; and which wa
still more lucki she want exactli the advic they gave

thi wa the occurrence:--th cole had been settl some year
in highburi and were veri good sort of people--friendli liber
and unpretending; but on the other hand they were of low origin
in trade and onli moder genteel on their first come into
the countri they had live in proport to their incom quietli
keep littl compani and that littl unexpensively; but the last
year or two had brought them a consider increas of means--
the hous in town had yield greater profit and fortun in gener
had smile on them with their wealth their view increased;
their want of a larger hous their inclin for more compani
they ad to their hous to their number of servant
to their expens of everi sort; and by thi time were in fortun
and style of live second onli to the famili at hartfield
their love of societi and their new dining-room prepar everi bodi
for their keep dinner-company; and a few parti chiefli among
the singl men had alreadi taken place the regular and best
famili emma could hardli suppos they would presum to invite--
neither donwel nor hartfield nor randal noth should
tempt _her_ to go if they did; and she regret that her father
known habit would be give her refus less mean than she
could wish the cole were veri respect in their way but they
ought to be taught that it wa not for them to arrang the term
on which the superior famili would visit them thi lesson
she veri much fear they would receiv onli from herself;
she had littl hope of mr knightley none of mr weston

but she had made up her mind how to meet thi presumpt so mani
week befor it appear that when the insult came at last
it found her veri differ affect donwel and randal
had receiv their invit and none had come for her father
and herself; and mr weston account for it with i suppos
they will not take the liberti with you; they know you do not
dine out wa not quit suffici she felt that she should
like to have had the power of refusal; and afterward as the idea
of the parti to be assembl there consist precis of those
whose societi wa dearest to her occur again and again
she did not know that she might not have been tempt to accept
harriet wa to be there in the even and the bates they had
been speak of it as they walk about highburi the day befor
and frank churchil had most earnestli lament her absenc
might not the even end in a dance? had been a question of hi
the bare possibl of it act as a farther irrit on her spirits;
and her be left in solitari grandeur even suppos the omiss
to be intend as a compliment wa but poor comfort

it wa the arriv of thi veri invit while the weston were
at hartfield which made their presenc so acceptable; for though her
first remark on read it wa that of cours it must be declin
she so veri soon proceed to ask them what they advis her to do
that their advic for her go wa most prompt and success

she own that consid everi thing she wa not absolut
without inclin for the parti the cole express themselv
so properly--ther wa so much real attent in the manner of it--
so much consider for her father they would have solicit the
honour earlier but had been wait the arriv of a folding-screen
from london which they hope might keep mr woodhous from ani draught
of air and therefor induc him the more readili to give them the
honour of hi compani upon the whole she wa veri persuadable;
and it be briefli settl among themselv how it might be
done without neglect hi comfort--how certainli mr goddard
if not mr bate might be depend on for bear him company--
mr woodhous wa to be talk into an acquiesc of hi daughter
go out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spend
the whole even away from him as for _his_ go emma did
not wish him to think it possibl the hour would be too late
and the parti too numer he wa soon pretti well resign

i am not fond of dinner-visit said he--i never wa
no more is emma late hour do not agre with us i am sorri
mr and mr cole should have done it i think it would be
much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer
and take their tea with us--tak us in their afternoon walk;
which they might do as our hour are so reason and yet get home
without be out in the damp of the even the dew of a summer
even are what i would not expos ani bodi to howev as they
are so veri desir to have dear emma dine with them and as you
will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her
i cannot wish to prevent it provid the weather be what it ought
neither damp nor cold nor windi then turn to mr weston
with a look of gentl reproach--ah! miss taylor if you had
not marri you would have staid at home with me

well sir cri mr weston as i took miss taylor away
it is incumb on me to suppli her place if i can; and i will
step to mr goddard in a moment if you wish it

but the idea of ani thing to be done in a _moment_ wa increas
not lessen mr woodhous agit the ladi knew better
how to allay it mr weston must be quiet and everi thing
deliber arrang

with thi treatment mr woodhous wa soon compos enough
for talk as usual he should be happi to see mr goddard
he had a great regard for mr goddard; and emma should write a line
and invit her jame could take the note but first of all
there must be an answer written to mr cole

you will make my excus my dear as civilli as possibl you will
say that i am quit an invalid and go no where and therefor must
declin their oblig invitation; begin with my _compliments_
of cours but you will do everi thing right i need not tell you
what is to be done we must rememb to let jame know that the carriag
will be want on tuesday i shall have no fear for you with him
we have never been there abov onc sinc the new approach wa made;
but still i have no doubt that jame will take you veri safe
and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would
have him come for you again; and you had better name an earli hour
you will not like stay late you will get veri tire when tea
is over

but you would not wish me to come away befor i am tire papa?

oh! no my love; but you will soon be tire there will be
a great mani peopl talk at onc you will not like the nois

but my dear sir cri mr weston if emma come away earli
it will be break up the parti

and no great harm if it doe said mr woodhous the sooner
everi parti break up the better

but you do not consid how it may appear to the cole
emma go away directli after tea might be give offenc
they are good-natur peopl and think littl of their own claims;
but still they must feel that ani bodi hurri away is no
great compliment; and miss woodhous do it would be more thought
of than ani other person in the room you would not wish to disappoint
and mortifi the cole i am sure sir; friendli good sort of peopl
as ever live and who have been your neighbour these _ten_ year

no upon no account in the world mr weston; i am much oblig
to you for remind me i should be extrem sorri to be give
them ani pain i know what worthi peopl they are perri tell
me that mr cole never touch malt liquor you would not think
it to look at him but he is bilious--mr cole is veri biliou
no i would not be the mean of give them ani pain my dear emma
we must consid thi i am sure rather than run the risk of hurt
mr and mr cole you would stay a littl longer than you might wish
you will not regard be tire you will be perfectli safe
you know among your friend

oh ye papa i have no fear at all for myself; and i should have
no scrupl of stay as late as mr weston but on your account
i am onli afraid of your sit up for me i am not afraid
of your not be exceedingli comfort with mr goddard
she love piquet you know; but when she is gone home i am afraid
you will be sit up by yourself instead of go to bed at your
usual time--and the idea of that would entir destroy my comfort
you must promis me not to sit up

he did on the condit of some promis on her side: such as that
if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;
if hungri that she would take someth to eat; that her own maid
should sit up for her; and that serl and the butler should see
that everi thing were safe in the hous as usual



chapter viii


frank churchil came back again; and if he kept hi father
dinner wait it wa not known at hartfield; for mr weston
wa too anxiou for hi be a favourit with mr woodhous
to betray ani imperfect which could be conceal

he came back had had hi hair cut and laugh at himself with
a veri good grace but without seem realli at all asham
of what he had done he had no reason to wish hi hair longer
to conceal ani confus of face; no reason to wish the money unspent
to improv hi spirit he wa quit as undaunt and as live
as ever; and after see him emma thu moralis to herself:--

i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainli silli thing
do ceas to be silli if they are done by sensibl peopl in an
impud way wicked is alway wicked but folli is not
alway folly--it depend upon the charact of those who handl it
mr knightley he is _not_ a trifl silli young man if he were
he would have done thi differ he would either have glori
in the achiev or been asham of it there would have been
either the ostent of a coxcomb or the evas of a mind too
weak to defend it own vanities--no i am perfectli sure that he
is not trifl or silli

with tuesday came the agreeabl prospect of see him again
and for a longer time than hitherto; of judg of hi gener manner
and by infer of the mean of hi manner toward herself;
of guess how soon it might be necessari for her to throw cold
into her air; and of fanci what the observ of all those
might be who were now see them togeth for the first time

she meant to be veri happi in spite of the scene be laid at
mr coles; and without be abl to forget that among the fail
of mr elton even in the day of hi favour none had disturb
her more than hi propens to dine with mr cole

her father comfort wa ampli secur mr bate as well as
mr goddard be abl to come; and her last pleas duti
befor she left the hous wa to pay her respect to them as
they sat togeth after dinner; and while her father wa fondli
notic the beauti of her dress to make the two ladi all
the amend in her power by help them to larg slice of cake
and full glass of wine for whatev unwil self-deni hi
care of their constitut might have oblig them to practis
dure the meal--sh had provid a plenti dinner for them;
she wish she could know that they had been allow to eat it

she follow anoth carriag to mr cole door; and wa pleas
to see that it wa mr knightleys; for mr knightley keep
no hors have littl spare money and a great deal of health
activ and independ wa too apt in emma opinion to get
about as he could and not use hi carriag so often as becam
the owner of donwel abbey she had an opportun now of speak
her approb while warm from her heart for he stop to hand her out

thi is come as you should do said she; like a gentleman--
i am quit glad to see you

he thank her observ how lucki that we should arriv at the same
moment! for if we had met first in the drawing-room i doubt whether
you would have discern me to be more of a gentleman than usual--
you might not have distinguish how i came by my look or manner

ye i should i am sure i should there is alway a look of
conscious or bustl when peopl come in a way which they know
to be beneath them you think you carri it off veri well i dare say
but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affect unconcern;
i alway observ it whenev i meet you under those circumst
_now_ you have noth to tri for you are not afraid of be
suppos asham you are not strive to look taller than ani
bodi els _now_ i shall realli be veri happi to walk into the same
room with you

nonsens girl! wa hi repli but not at all in anger

emma had as much reason to be satisfi with the rest of the parti
as with mr knightley she wa receiv with a cordial respect
which could not but pleas and given all the consequ she could
wish for when the weston arriv the kindest look of love
the strongest of admir were for her from both husband and wife;
the son approach her with a cheer eager which mark
her as hi peculiar object and at dinner she found him seat
by her--and as she firmli believ not without some dexter
on hi side

the parti wa rather larg as it includ one other famili a proper
unobjection countri famili whom the cole had the advantag of
name among their acquaint and the male part of mr cox famili
the lawyer of highburi the less worthi femal were to come
in the even with miss bate miss fairfax and miss smith;
but alreadi at dinner they were too numer for ani subject
of convers to be general; and while polit and mr elton
were talk over emma could fairli surrend all her attent to
the pleasant of her neighbour the first remot sound to which
she felt herself oblig to attend wa the name of jane fairfax
mr cole seem to be relat someth of her that wa expect to be
veri interest she listen and found it well worth listen to
that veri dear part of emma her fanci receiv an amus suppli
mr cole wa tell that she had been call on miss bate
and as soon as she enter the room had been struck by the sight
of a pianoforte--a veri eleg look instrument--not a grand
but a large-s squar pianoforte; and the substanc of the stori
the end of all the dialogu which ensu of surpriz and inquiri
and congratul on her side and explan on miss batess wa
that thi pianofort had arriv from broadwood the day befor
to the great astonish of both aunt and niece--entir unexpected;
that at first by miss batess account jane herself wa quit at
a loss quit bewild to think who could possibl have order it--
but now they were both perfectli satisfi that it could be from onli
one quarter;--of cours it must be from colonel campbel

one can suppos noth els ad mr cole and i wa onli
surpriz that there could ever have been a doubt but jane
it seem had a letter from them veri late and not a word wa said
about it she know their way best; but i should not consid their
silenc as ani reason for their not mean to make the present
they might chuse to surpriz her

mr cole had mani to agre with her; everi bodi who spoke on the
subject wa equal convinc that it must come from colonel campbel
and equal rejoic that such a present had been made; and there
were enough readi to speak to allow emma to think her own way
and still listen to mr cole

i declar i do not know when i have heard ani thing that ha given
me more satisfaction!--it alway ha quit hurt me that jane fairfax
who play so delight should not have an instrument
it seem quit a shame especi consid how mani hous
there are where fine instrument are absolut thrown away
thi is like give ourselv a slap to be sure! and it wa
but yesterday i wa tell mr cole i realli wa asham
to look at our new grand pianofort in the drawing-room while i
do not know one note from anoth and our littl girl who are
but just begin perhap may never make ani thing of it;
and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music ha not
ani thing of the natur of an instrument not even the pitifullest
old spinet in the world to amus herself with--i wa say thi
to mr cole but yesterday and he quit agre with me; onli he
is so particularli fond of music that he could not help indulg
himself in the purchas hope that some of our good neighbour might
be so oblig occasion to put it to a better use than we can;
and that realli is the reason whi the instrument wa bought--
or els i am sure we ought to be asham of it--w are in great
hope that miss woodhous may be prevail with to tri it thi even

miss woodhous made the proper acquiescence; and find that noth
more wa to be entrap from ani commun of mr cole
turn to frank churchil

whi do you smile? said she

nay whi do you?

me!--i suppos i smile for pleasur at colonel campbel be
so rich and so liberal--it is a handsom present

veri

i rather wonder that it wa never made befor

perhap miss fairfax ha never been stay here so long befor

or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--
which must now be shut up in london untouch by ani bodi

that is a grand pianofort and he might think it too larg
for mr batess hous

you may _say_ what you chuse--but your counten testifi
that your _thoughts_ on thi subject are veri much like mine

i do not know i rather believ you are give me more credit for
acut than i deserv i smile becaus you smile and shall probabl
suspect whatev i find you suspect; but at present i do not see what
there is to question if colonel campbel is not the person who can be?

what do you say to mr dixon?

mr dixon! veri true inde i had not thought of mr dixon
she must know as well as her father how accept an instrument
would be; and perhap the mode of it the mysteri the surpriz
is more like a young woman scheme than an elderli man it
is mr dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicion would
guid mine

if so you must extend your suspicion and comprehend _mr_ dixon
in them

mr dixon--veri well ye i immedi perceiv that it must
be the joint present of mr and mr dixon we were speak the
other day you know of hi be so warm an admir of her perform

ye and what you told me on that head confirm an idea which i
had entertain before--i do not mean to reflect upon the good
intent of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help
suspect either that after make hi propos to her friend
he had the misfortun to fall in love with _her_ or that he becam
consciou of a littl attach on her side one might guess
twenti thing without guess exactli the right; but i am sure
there must be a particular caus for her chuse to come to highburi
instead of go with the campbel to ireland here she must be
lead a life of privat and penance; there it would have been
all enjoy as to the pretenc of tri her nativ air i look
upon that as a mere excuse--in the summer it might have passed;
but what can ani bodi nativ air do for them in the month
of januari februari and march? good fire and carriag would
be much more to the purpos in most case of delic health and i
dare say in her i do not requir you to adopt all my suspicion
though you make so nobl a profess of do it but i honestli
tell you what they are

and upon my word they have an air of great probabl
mr dixon prefer of her music to her friend i can answer
for be veri decid

and then he save her life did you ever hear of that?--
a water party; and by some accid she wa fall overboard
he caught her

he did i wa there--on of the parti

were you really?--well!--but you observ noth of cours
for it seem to be a new idea to you--if i had been there i think
i should have made some discoveri

i dare say you would; but i simpl i saw noth but the fact
that miss fairfax wa nearli dash from the vessel and that mr dixon
caught her--it wa the work of a moment and though the consequ
shock and alarm wa veri great and much more durable--inde i
believ it wa half an hour befor ani of us were comfort again--
yet that wa too gener a sensat for ani thing of peculiar
anxieti to be observ i do not mean to say howev that you
might not have made discoveri

the convers wa here interrupt they were call on to share
in the awkward of a rather long interv between the cours
and oblig to be as formal and as orderli as the others; but when
the tabl wa again safe cover when everi corner dish wa place
exactli right and occup and eas were gener restor
emma said

the arriv of thi pianofort is decis with me i want to know
a littl more and thi tell me quit enough depend upon it
we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mr dixon

and if the dixon should absolut deni all knowledg of it we
must conclud it to come from the campbel

no i am sure it is not from the campbel miss fairfax know it
is not from the campbel or they would have been guess at first
she would not have been puzzl had she dare fix on them
i may not have convinc you perhap but i am perfectli convinc
myself that mr dixon is a princip in the busi

inde you injur me if you suppos me unconvinc your reason
carri my judgment along with them entir at first while i
suppos you satisfi that colonel campbel wa the giver i saw
it onli as patern kind and thought it the most natur thing
in the world but when you mention mr dixon i felt how much more
probabl that it should be the tribut of warm femal friendship
and now i can see it in no other light than as an offer of love

there wa no occas to press the matter farther the convict
seem real; he look as if he felt it she said no more
other subject took their turn; and the rest of the dinner pass away;
the dessert succeed the children came in and were talk
to and admir amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever
thing said a few downright silli but by much the larger proport
neither the one nor the other--noth wors than everyday remark
dull repetit old news and heavi joke

the ladi had not been long in the drawing-room befor the other ladi
in their differ divis arriv emma watch the entre of her
own particular littl friend; and if she could not exult in her digniti
and grace she could not onli love the bloom sweet and the
artless manner but could most heartili rejoic in that light cheer
unsentiment disposit which allow her so mani allevi
of pleasur in the midst of the pang of disappoint affect
there she sat--and who would have guess how mani tear she had
been late shedding? to be in compani nice dress herself
and see other nice dress to sit and smile and look pretti
and say noth wa enough for the happi of the present hour
jane fairfax did look and move superior; but emma suspect she
might have been glad to chang feel with harriet veri glad
to have purchas the mortif of have loved--y of have
love even mr elton in vain--bi the surrend of all the danger
pleasur of know herself belov by the husband of her friend

in so larg a parti it wa not necessari that emma should approach her
she did not wish to speak of the pianofort she felt too much
in the secret herself to think the appear of curios
or interest fair and therefor purpos kept at a distance;
but by the other the subject wa almost immedi introduc
and she saw the blush of conscious with which congratul
were receiv the blush of guilt which accompani the name of my
excel friend colonel campbel

mr weston kind-heart and music wa particularli interest
by the circumst and emma could not help be amus at her
persever in dwell on the subject; and have so much to ask
and to say as to tone touch and pedal total unsuspici
of that wish of say as littl about it as possibl which she
plainli read in the fair heroin counten

they were soon join by some of the gentlemen; and the veri first of the
earli wa frank churchil in he walk the first and the handsomest;
and after pay hi compliment en passant to miss bate and
her niec made hi way directli to the opposit side of the circl
where sat miss woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her
would not sit at all emma divin what everi bodi present must
be think she wa hi object and everi bodi must perceiv it
she introduc him to her friend miss smith and at conveni
moment afterward heard what each thought of the other he had
never seen so love a face and wa delight with her naivet
and she onli to be sure it wa pay him too great a compliment
but she did think there were some look a littl like mr elton
emma restrain her indign and onli turn from her in silenc

smile of intellig pass between her and the gentleman on first
glanc toward miss fairfax; but it wa most prudent to avoid speech
he told her that he had been impati to leav the dining-room--
hate sit long--wa alway the first to move when he could--
that hi father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left
veri busi over parish business--that as long as he had staid
howev it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in gener
a set of gentlemanlik sensibl men; and spoke so handsom of
highburi altogether--thought it so abund in agreeabl families--
that emma began to feel she had been use to despis the place
rather too much she question him as to the societi in yorkshire--
the extent of the neighbourhood about enscomb and the sort;
and could make out from hi answer that as far as enscomb
wa concern there wa veri littl go on that their visit
were among a rang of great famili none veri near; and that even
when day were fix and invit accept it wa an even
chanc that mr churchil were not in health and spirit for going;
that they made a point of visit no fresh person; and that
though he had hi separ engag it wa not without difficulti
without consider address _at_ _times_ that he could get away
or introduc an acquaint for a night

she saw that enscomb could not satisfi and that highburi
taken at it best might reason pleas a young man who had more
retir at home than he like hi import at enscomb wa
veri evid he did not boast but it natur betray itself
that he had persuad hi aunt where hi uncl could do noth
and on her laugh and notic it he own that he believ (except
one or two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuad her to ani thing
one of those point on which hi influenc fail he then mention
he had want veri much to go abroad--had been veri eager inde
to be allow to travel--but she would not hear of it thi had
happen the year befor _now_ he said he wa begin to have
no longer the same wish

the unpersuad point which he did not mention emma guess
to be good behaviour to hi father

i have made a most wretch discoveri said he after a short pause--
i have been here a week to-morrow--half my time i never knew
day fli so fast a week to-morrow!--and i have hardli begun to
enjoy myself but just got acquaint with mr weston and others!--
i hate the recollect

perhap you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day
out of so few in have your hair cut

no said he smile that is no subject of regret at all
i have no pleasur in see my friend unless i can believ myself
fit to be seen

the rest of the gentlemen be now in the room emma found herself
oblig to turn from him for a few minut and listen to mr cole
when mr cole had move away and her attent could be restor
as befor she saw frank churchil look intent across the room
at miss fairfax who wa sit exactli opposit

what is the matter? said she

he start thank you for rous me he repli i believ
i have been veri rude; but realli miss fairfax ha done her hair
in so odd a way--so veri odd a way--that i cannot keep my eye
from her i never saw ani thing so outree!--thos curls!--thi must
be a fanci of her own i see nobodi els look like her!--
i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i?--
ye i will--i declar i will--and you shall see how she take it;--
whether she colour

he wa gone immediately; and emma soon saw him stand befor miss
fairfax and talk to her; but as to it effect on the young ladi
as he had improvid place himself exactli between them exactli
in front of miss fairfax she could absolut distinguish noth

befor he could return to hi chair it wa taken by mr weston

thi is the luxuri of a larg parti said she:--on can get
near everi bodi and say everi thing my dear emma i am long
to talk to you i have been make discoveri and form plan
just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh
do you know how miss bate and her niec came here?

how?--they were invit were not they?

oh! yes--but how they were convey hither?--th manner of their coming?

they walk i conclud how els could they come?

veri true--wel a littl while ago it occur to me how veri sad
it would be to have jane fairfax walk home again late at night
and cold as the night are now and as i look at her though i
never saw her appear to more advantag it struck me that she
wa heat and would therefor be particularli liabl to take cold
poor girl! i could not bear the idea of it; so as soon as mr weston
came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about
the carriag you may guess how readili he came into my wishes;
and have hi approb i made my way directli to miss bate
to assur her that the carriag would be at her servic befor it took
us home; for i thought it would be make her comfort at onc
good soul! she wa as grate as possibl you may be sure
`nobodi wa ever so fortun as herself!--but with mani
mani thanks--`ther wa no occas to troubl us for mr knightley
carriag had brought and wa to take them home again i wa
quit surprized;--veri glad i am sure; but realli quit surpriz
such a veri kind attention--and so thought an attention!--
the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short
from know hi usual way i am veri much inclin to think
that it wa for their accommod the carriag wa use at all
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of hors for himself
and that it wa onli as an excus for assist them

veri like said emma--noth more like i know no man
more like than mr knightley to do the sort of thing--to do ani
thing realli good-natur use consider or benevol
he is not a gallant man but he is a veri human one; and thi
consid jane fairfax ill-health would appear a case
of human to him;--and for an act of unostentati kind
there is nobodi whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley
i know he had hors to-day--for we arriv together; and i laugh at
him about it but he said not a word that could betray

well said mr weston smile you give him credit for
more simpl disinterest benevol in thi instanc than i do;
for while miss bate wa speak a suspicion dart into my head
and i have never been abl to get it out again the more i think
of it the more probabl it appear in short i have made a match
between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequ
of keep you company!--what do you say to it?

mr knightley and jane fairfax! exclaim emma dear mr weston
how could you think of such a thing?--mr knightley!--mr knightley
must not marry!--y would not have littl henri cut out from donwell?--
oh! no no henri must have donwel i cannot at all consent to
mr knightley marrying; and i am sure it is not at all like
i am amaz that you should think of such a thing

my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it
i do not want the match--i do not want to injur dear littl henry--
but the idea ha been given me by circumstances; and if mr knightley
realli wish to marri you would not have him refrain on henri
account a boy of six year old who know noth of the matter?

ye i would i could not bear to have henri supplanted--
mr knightley marry!--no i have never had such an idea and i
cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women!

nay she ha alway been a first favourit with him as you
veri well know

but the imprud of such a match!

i am not speak of it prudence; mere it probabl

i see no probabl in it unless you have ani better foundat
than what you mention hi good-natur hi human as i tell you
would be quit enough to account for the hors he ha a great
regard for the bates you know independ of jane fairfax--
and is alway glad to shew them attent my dear mr weston
do not take to match-mak you do it veri ill jane fairfax mistress
of the abbey!--oh! no no;--everi feel revolt for hi own sake
i would not have him do so mad a thing

imprud if you please--but not mad except inequ of fortun
and perhap a littl dispar of age i can see noth unsuit

but mr knightley doe not want to marri i am sure he ha not the
least idea of it do not put it into hi head whi should he marry?--
he is as happi as possibl by himself; with hi farm and hi sheep
and hi librari and all the parish to manage; and he is extrem
fond of hi brother children he ha no occas to marri
either to fill up hi time or hi heart

my dear emma as long as he think so it is so; but if he realli
love jane fairfax--

nonsense! he doe not care about jane fairfax in the way
of love i am sure he doe not he would do ani good to her
or her family; but--

well said mr weston laugh perhap the greatest good he
could do them would be to give jane such a respect home

if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself;
a veri shame and degrad connexion how would he bear to have
miss bate belong to him?--to have her haunt the abbey
and thank him all day long for hi great kind in marri jane?--
`so veri kind and obliging!--but he alway had been such a veri
kind neighbour! and then fli off through half a sentenc
to her mother old petticoat `not that it wa such a veri old
petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and inde
she must thank say that their petticoat were all veri strong

for shame emma! do not mimic her you divert me against
my conscienc and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would
be much disturb by miss bate littl thing do not irrit him
she might talk on; and if he want to say ani thing himself he would
onli talk louder and drown her voic but the question is not
whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wish it;
and i think he doe i have heard him speak and so must you
so veri highli of jane fairfax! the interest he take in her--
hi anxieti about her health--hi concern that she should have no
happier prospect! i have heard him express himself so warmli on
those points!--such an admir of her perform on the pianofort
and of her voice! i have heard him say that he could listen to her
for ever oh! and i had almost forgotten one idea that occur
to me--thi pianofort that ha been sent here by somebody--
though we have all been so well satisfi to consid it a present
from the campbel may it not be from mr knightley? i cannot
help suspect him i think he is just the person to do it
even without be in love

then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love
but i do not think it is at all a like thing for him to do
mr knightley doe noth mysteri

i have heard him lament her have no instrument repeatedly;
often than i should suppos such a circumst would in the common
cours of thing occur to him

veri well; and if he had intend to give her one he would have
told her so

there might be scrupl of delicaci my dear emma i have a veri
strong notion that it come from him i am sure he wa particularli
silent when mr cole told us of it at dinner

you take up an idea mr weston and run away with it; as you have
mani a time reproach me with do i see no sign of attachment--
i believ noth of the pianoforte--and proof onli shall convinc
me that mr knightley ha ani thought of marri jane fairfax

they combat the point some time longer in the same way; emma rather
gain ground over the mind of her friend; for mr weston wa
the most use of the two to yield; till a littl bustl in the room
shew them that tea wa over and the instrument in preparation;--
and at the same moment mr cole approach to entreat miss woodhous
would do them the honour of tri it frank churchil of whom
in the eager of her convers with mr weston she had been
see noth except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax
follow mr cole to add hi veri press entreaties; and as
in everi respect it suit emma best to lead she gave a veri
proper complianc

she knew the limit of her own power too well to attempt
more than she could perform with credit; she want neither tast
nor spirit in the littl thing which are gener accept
and could accompani her own voic well one accompani to her song
took her agreeabl by surprize--a second slightli but correctli
taken by frank churchil her pardon wa duli beg at the close
of the song and everi thing usual follow he wa accus
of have a delight voic and a perfect knowledg of music;
which wa properli denied; and that he knew noth of the matter
and had no voic at all roundli assert they sang togeth
onc more; and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax
whose perform both vocal and instrument she never could
attempt to conceal from herself wa infinit superior to her own

with mix feel she seat herself at a littl distanc from the
number round the instrument to listen frank churchil sang again
they had sung togeth onc or twice it appear at weymouth
but the sight of mr knightley among the most attent soon drew
away half emma mind; and she fell into a train of think
on the subject of mr weston suspicion to which the sweet
sound of the unit voic gave onli momentari interrupt
her object to mr knightley marri did not in the least subsid
she could see noth but evil in it it would be a great
disappoint to mr john knightley; consequ to isabella
a real injuri to the children--a most mortifi chang
and materi loss to them all;--a veri great deduct from her
father daili comfort--and as to herself she could not at all
endur the idea of jane fairfax at donwel abbey a mr knightley
for them all to give way to!--no--mr knightley must never marri
littl henri must remain the heir of donwel

present mr knightley look back and came and sat down by her
they talk at first onli of the perform hi admir
wa certainli veri warm; yet she thought but for mr weston
it would not have struck her as a sort of touchston howev
she began to speak of hi kind in convey the aunt and niece;
and though hi answer wa in the spirit of cut the matter short
she believ it to indic onli hi disinclin to dwell on ani
kind of hi own

i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriag
more use on such occas it is not that i am without the wish;
but you know how imposs my father would deem it that jame
should put-to for such a purpos

quit out of the question quit out of the question he replied;--
but you must often wish it i am sure and he smile with such
seem pleasur at the convict that she must proceed anoth step

thi present from the campbel said she--thi pianofort
is veri kindli given

ye he repli and without the smallest appar embarrassment--
but they would have done better had they given her notic of it
surpriz are foolish thing the pleasur is not enhanc and the
inconveni is often consider i should have expect better
judgment in colonel campbel

from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley
had had no concern in give the instrument but whether he
were entir free from peculiar attachment--wheth there
were no actual preference--remain a littl longer doubt
toward the end of jane second song her voic grew thick

that will do said he when it wa finish think aloud--
you have sung quit enough for one evening--now be quiet

anoth song howev wa soon beg for one more;--they would
not fatigu miss fairfax on ani account and would onli ask for
one more and frank churchil wa heard to say i think you could
manag thi without effort; the first part is so veri trifl
the strength of the song fall on the second

mr knightley grew angri

that fellow said he indignantli think of noth but shew
off hi own voic thi must not be and touch miss bate
who at that moment pass near--miss bate are you mad to let
your niec sing herself hoars in thi manner? go and interfer
they have no merci on her

miss bate in her real anxieti for jane could hardli stay even
to be grate befor she stept forward and put an end to all
farther sing here ceas the concert part of the even
for miss woodhous and miss fairfax were the onli young ladi performers;
but soon (within five minutes) the propos of dancing--
origin nobodi exactli knew where--wa so effectu promot
by mr and mr cole that everi thing wa rapidli clear away
to give proper space mr weston capit in her country-d
wa seat and begin an irresist waltz; and frank churchil
come up with most becom gallantri to emma had secur her hand
and led her up to the top

while wait till the other young peopl could pair themselv off
emma found time in spite of the compliment she wa receiv on her
voic and her tast to look about and see what becam of mr knightley
thi would be a trial he wa no dancer in gener if he were to be
veri alert in engag jane fairfax now it might augur someth
there wa no immedi appear no; he wa talk to mr cole--
he wa look on unconcerned; jane wa ask by somebodi els
and he wa still talk to mr cole

emma had no longer an alarm for henry; hi interest wa yet safe;
and she led off the danc with genuin spirit and enjoy
not more than five coupl could be mustered; but the rariti and the
sudden of it made it veri delight and she found herself well
match in a partner they were a coupl worth look at

two danc unfortun were all that could be allow
it wa grow late and miss bate becam anxiou to get home
on her mother account after some attempt therefor to be
permit to begin again they were oblig to thank mr weston
look sorrow and have done

perhap it is as well said frank churchil as he attend emma
to her carriag i must have ask miss fairfax and her languid
danc would not have agre with me after your



chapter ix


emma did not repent her condescens in go to the cole
the visit afford her mani pleasant recollect the next day;
and all that she might be suppos to have lost on the side
of dignifi seclus must be ampli repaid in the splendour
of popular she must have delight the coles--worthi peopl
who deserv to be made happy!--and left a name behind her that would
not soon die away

perfect happi even in memori is not common; and there were
two point on which she wa not quit easi she doubt whether
she had not transgress the duti of woman by woman in betray
her suspicion of jane fairfax feel to frank churchil
it wa hardli right; but it had been so strong an idea that it
would escap her and hi submiss to all that she told
wa a compliment to her penetr which made it difficult
for her to be quit certain that she ought to have held her tongu

the other circumst of regret relat also to jane fairfax;
and there she had no doubt she did unfeignedli and unequivoc
regret the inferior of her own play and sing she did
most heartili griev over the idl of her childhood--and sat
down and practis vigor an hour and a half

she wa then interrupt by harriet come in; and if harriet
prais could have satisfi her she might soon have been comfort

oh! if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax!

dont class us togeth harriet my play is no more like
her than a lamp is like sunshin

oh! dear--i think you play the best of the two i think you play
quit as well as she doe i am sure i had much rather hear you
everi bodi last night said how well you play

those who knew ani thing about it must have felt the differ
the truth is harriet that my play is just good enough to be prais
but jane fairfax is much beyond it

well i alway shall think that you play quit as well as she doe
or that if there is ani differ nobodi would ever find it out
mr cole said how much tast you had; and mr frank churchil talk
a great deal about your tast and that he valu tast much more
than execut

ah! but jane fairfax ha them both harriet

are you sure? i saw she had execut but i did not know she had
ani tast nobodi talk about it and i hate italian singing--
there is no understand a word of it besid if she doe play
so veri well you know it is no more than she is oblig to do
becaus she will have to teach the cox were wonder last night
whether she would get into ani great famili how did you think the
cox looked?

just as they alway do--veri vulgar

they told me someth said harriet rather hesitatingly;
but it is noth of ani consequ

emma wa oblig to ask what they had told her though fear
of it produc mr elton

they told me--that mr martin dine with them last saturday

oh!

he came to their father upon some busi and he ask him
to stay to dinner

oh!

they talk a great deal about him especi ann cox
i do not know what she meant but she ask me if i thought i
should go and stay there again next summer

she meant to be impertin curiou just as such an ann cox
should be

she said he wa veri agreeabl the day he dine there he sat
by her at dinner miss nash think either of the cox would
be veri glad to marri him

veri likely--i think they are without except the most vulgar
girl in highburi

harriet had busi at fords--emma thought it most prudent to go
with her anoth accident meet with the martin wa possibl
and in her present state would be danger

harriet tempt by everi thing and sway by half a word wa alway
veri long at a purchase; and while she wa still hang over muslin
and chang her mind emma went to the door for amusement--much could
not be hope from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury;--
mr perri walk hastili by mr william cox let himself in at
the office-door mr cole carriage-hors return from exercis
or a stray letter-boy on an obstin mule were the liveliest
object she could presum to expect; and when her eye fell onli on
the butcher with hi tray a tidi old woman travel homeward from
shop with her full basket two cur quarrel over a dirti bone
and a string of dawdl children round the baker littl bow-window
eye the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain
and wa amus enough; quit enough still to stand at the door
a mind live and at eas can do with see noth and can see
noth that doe not answer

she look down the randal road the scene enlarged;
two person appeared; mr weston and her son-in-law; they were
walk into highbury;--to hartfield of cours they were stop
howev in the first place at mr batess; whose hous wa
a littl nearer randal than fords; and had all but knock
when emma caught their eye--immedi they cross the road
and came forward to her; and the agreeabl of yesterday
engag seem to give fresh pleasur to the present meet
mr weston inform her that she wa go to call on the bates
in order to hear the new instrument

for my companion tell me said she that i absolut promis
miss bate last night that i would come thi morn i wa
not awar of it myself i did not know that i had fix a day
but as he say i did i am go now

and while mr weston pay her visit i may be allow i hope
said frank churchil to join your parti and wait for her at hartfield--
if you are go home

mr weston wa disappoint

i thought you meant to go with me they would be veri much pleas

me! i should be quit in the way but perhaps--i may be equal
in the way here miss woodhous look as if she did not want me
my aunt alway send me off when she is shop she say i fidget
her to death; and miss woodhous look as if she could almost say
the same what am i to do?

i am here on no busi of my own said emma; i am onli wait
for my friend she will probabl have soon done and then we
shall go home but you had better go with mr weston and hear
the instrument

well--if you advis it--but (with a smile) if colonel campbel
should have employ a careless friend and if it should prove
to have an indiffer tone--what shall i say? i shall be no
support to mr weston she might do veri well by herself
a disagre truth would be palat through her lip but i
am the wretchedest be in the world at a civil falsehood

i do not believ ani such thing repli emma--i am persuad
that you can be as insincer as your neighbour when it is necessary;
but there is no reason to suppos the instrument is indiffer
quit otherwis inde if i understood miss fairfax opinion
last night

do come with me said mr weston if it be not veri disagre
to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterward
we will follow them to hartfield i realli wish you to call with me
it will be felt so great an attention! and i alway thought you
meant it

he could say no more; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him
return with mr weston to mr batess door emma watch them in
and then join harriet at the interest counter--tri with all
the forc of her own mind to convinc her that if she want plain
muslin it wa of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon
be it ever so beauti would still never match her yellow pattern
at last it wa all settl even to the destin of the parcel

should i send it to mr goddard maam? ask mr ford--
yes--no--y to mr goddard onli my pattern gown is
at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you pleas
but then mr goddard will want to see it--and i could take the
pattern gown home ani day but i shall want the ribbon directly--
so it had better go to hartfield--at least the ribbon you could
make it into two parcel mr ford could not you?

it is not worth while harriet to give mr ford the troubl
of two parcel

no more it is

no troubl in the world maam said the oblig mr ford

oh! but inde i would much rather have it onli in one
then if you pleas you shall send it all to mr goddards--
i do not know--no i think miss woodhous i may just as well
have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night
what do you advise?

that you do not give anoth half-second to the subject
to hartfield if you pleas mr ford

aye that will be much best said harriet quit satisfi
i should not at all like to have it sent to mr goddard

voic approach the shop--or rather one voic and two ladies:
mr weston and miss bate met them at the door

my dear miss woodhous said the latter i am just run across to
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a littl while
and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and miss smith
how do you do miss smith?--veri well i thank you--and i beg
mr weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeed

i hope mr bate and miss fairfax are--

veri well i am much oblig to you my mother is delight well;
and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse?--i am so glad
to hear such a good account mr weston told me you were here--
oh! then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhous will
allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother
will be so veri happi to see her--and now we are such a nice parti
she cannot refuse--`ay pray do said mr frank churchil
`miss woodhous opinion of the instrument will be worth having--
but said i i shall be more sure of succeed if one of you will go
with me--`oh said he `wait half a minut till i have finish
my job;--for would you believ it miss woodhous there he is
in the most oblig manner in the world fasten in the rivet of my
mother spectacles--th rivet came out you know thi morning--
so veri obliging!--for my mother had no use of her spectacles--
could not put them on and by the bye everi bodi ought to have
two pair of spectacles; they should inde jane said so
i meant to take them over to john saunder the first thing i did
but someth or other hinder me all the morning; first one thing
then anoth there is no say what you know at one time patti came
to say she thought the kitchen chimney want sweep oh said i
patti do not come with your bad news to me here is the rivet
of your mistresss spectacl out then the bake appl came home
mr walli sent them by her boy; they are extrem civil and
oblig to us the wallis always--i have heard some peopl
say that mr walli can be uncivil and give a veri rude answer
but we have never known ani thing but the greatest attent
from them and it cannot be for the valu of our custom now
for what is our consumpt of bread you know? onli three of us--
besid dear jane at present--and she realli eat nothing--mak such
a shock breakfast you would be quit frighten if you saw it
i dare not let my mother know how littl she eats--so i say one
thing and then i say anoth and it pass off but about the
middl of the day she get hungri and there is noth she like
so well as these bake appl and they are extrem wholesom
for i took the opportun the other day of ask mr perry;
i happen to meet him in the street not that i had ani doubt before--
i have so often heard mr woodhous recommend a bake appl
i believ it is the onli way that mr woodhous think the
fruit thoroughli wholesom we have apple-dumpl howev
veri often patti make an excel apple-dumpl well
mr weston you have prevail i hope and these ladi will
oblig us

emma would be veri happi to wait on mr bate &c and they
did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss
bate than

how do you do mr ford? i beg your pardon i did not see
you befor i hear you have a charm collect of new ribbon
from town jane came back delight yesterday thank ye
the glove do veri well--onli a littl too larg about the wrist;
but jane is take them in

what wa i talk of? said she begin again when they were
all in the street

emma wonder on what of all the medley she would fix

i declar i cannot recollect what i wa talk of--oh! my
mother spectacl so veri oblig of mr frank churchill!
`oh! said he `i do think i can fasten the rivet; i like a job
of thi kind excessively--which you know shew him to be so
veri inde i must say that much as i had heard of him
befor and much as i had expect he veri far exce ani
thing i do congratul you mr weston most warmli
he seem everi thing the fondest parent could `oh! said he
`i can fasten the rivet i like a job of that sort excess
i never shall forget hi manner and when i brought out the bake
appl from the closet and hope our friend would be so veri
oblig as to take some `oh! said he directli `there is noth
in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finest-look
home-bak appl i ever saw in my life that you know wa so
veri and i am sure by hi manner it wa no compliment
inde they are veri delight appl and mr walli doe them
full justice--onli we do not have them bake more than twice
and mr woodhous made us promis to have them done three times--
but miss woodhous will be so good as not to mention it the appl
themselv are the veri finest sort for bake beyond a doubt;
all from donwell--som of mr knightley most liber suppli
he send us a sack everi year; and certainli there never wa such
a keep appl anywher as one of hi trees--i believ there
is two of them my mother say the orchard wa alway famou
in her younger day but i wa realli quit shock the other day--
for mr knightley call one morn and jane wa eat these appl
and we talk about them and said how much she enjoy them
and he ask whether we were not got to the end of our stock
`i am sure you must be said he `and i will send you
anoth supply; for i have a great mani more than i can ever use
william larkin let me keep a larger quantiti than usual thi year
i will send you some more befor they get good for noth
so i beg he would not--for realli as to our be gone i could
not absolut say that we had a great mani left--it wa but half
a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for jane; and i could
not at all bear that he should be send us more so liber as he
had been already; and jane said the same and when he wa gone
she almost quarrel with me--no i should not say quarrel
for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she wa quit distress
that i had own the appl were so nearli gone; she wish i had
made him believ we had a great mani left oh said i my dear
i did say as much as i could howev the veri same even
william larkin came over with a larg basket of appl the same
sort of appl a bushel at least and i wa veri much oblig
and went down and spoke to william larkin and said everi thing
as you may suppos william larkin is such an old acquaintance!
i am alway glad to see him but howev i found afterward
from patti that william said it wa all the appl of _that_ sort
hi master had; he had brought them all--and now hi master had not
one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself
he wa so pleas to think hi master had sold so many; for william
you know think more of hi master profit than ani thing;
but mr hodg he said wa quit displeas at their be
all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be
abl to have anoth apple-tart thi spring he told patti thi
but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say ani thing to us
about it for mr hodg _would_ be cross sometim and as long as
so mani sack were sold it did not signifi who ate the remaind
and so patti told me and i wa excess shock indeed!
i would not have mr knightley know ani thing about it for
the world! he would be so veri i want to keep it from
jane knowledge; but unluckili i had mention it befor i wa
awar

miss bate had just done as patti open the door; and her visitor
walk upstair without have ani regular narrat to attend to
pursu onli by the sound of her desultori good-wil

pray take care mr weston there is a step at the turn
pray take care miss woodhous our is rather a dark staircase--
rather darker and narrow than one could wish miss smith
pray take care miss woodhous i am quit concern i am sure you
hit your foot miss smith the step at the turn



chapter x


the appear of the littl sitting-room as they enter
wa tranquil itself; mr bate depriv of her usual employ
slumber on one side of the fire frank churchil at a tabl
near her most deedili occupi about her spectacl and jane fairfax
stand with her back to them intent on her pianofort

busi as he wa howev the young man wa yet abl to shew a most
happi counten on see emma again

thi is a pleasur said he in rather a low voic come at
least ten minut earlier than i had calcul you find me
tri to be useful; tell me if you think i shall succeed

what! said mr weston have not you finish it yet? you would
not earn a veri good livelihood as a work silversmith at thi rate

i have not been work uninterruptedli he repli i have been
assist miss fairfax in tri to make her instrument stand steadili
it wa not quit firm; an uneven in the floor i believ
you see we have been wedg one leg with paper thi wa veri kind
of you to be persuad to come i wa almost afraid you would be
hurri home

he contriv that she should be seat by him; and wa suffici
employ in look out the best bake appl for her and tri
to make her help or advis him in hi work till jane fairfax wa
quit readi to sit down to the pianofort again that she wa not
immedi readi emma did suspect to aris from the state of her nerves;
she had not yet possess the instrument long enough to touch it
without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;
and emma could not but piti such feel whatev their origin
and could not but resolv never to expos them to her neighbour again

at last jane began and though the first bar were feebli given
the power of the instrument were gradual done full justic to
mr weston had been delight befor and wa delight again;
emma join her in all her praise; and the pianofort with everi
proper discrimin wa pronounc to be altogeth of the
highest promis

whoever colonel campbel might employ said frank churchil
with a smile at emma the person ha not chosen ill i heard a good
deal of colonel campbel tast at weymouth; and the soft of the
upper note i am sure is exactli what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would
particularli prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave
hi friend veri minut direct or wrote to broadwood himself
do not you think so?

jane did not look round she wa not oblig to hear mr weston
had been speak to her at the same moment

it is not fair said emma in a whisper; mine wa a random guess
do not distress her

he shook hi head with a smile and look as if he had veri littl
doubt and veri littl merci soon afterward he began again

how much your friend in ireland must be enjoy your pleasur
on thi occas miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you
and wonder which will be the day the precis day of the instrument
come to hand do you imagin colonel campbel know the busi
to be go forward just at thi time?--do you imagin it to be
the consequ of an immedi commiss from him or that he may
have sent onli a gener direct an order indefinit as to time
to depend upon conting and conveniences?

he paus she could not but hear; she could not avoid answer

till i have a letter from colonel campbel said she in a voic
of forc calm i can imagin noth with ani confid
it must be all conjectur

conjecture--ay sometim one conjectur right and sometim
one conjectur wrong i wish i could conjectur how soon i shall
make thi rivet quit firm what nonsens one talk miss woodhous
when hard at work if one talk at all;--your real workmen
i suppos hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labour if we get
hold of a word--miss fairfax said someth about conjectur
there it is done i have the pleasur madam (to mr bates)
of restor your spectacl heal for the present

he wa veri warmli thank both by mother and daughter; to escap
a littl from the latter he went to the pianofort and beg
miss fairfax who wa still sit at it to play someth more

if you are veri kind said he it will be one of the waltz
we danc last night;--let me live them over again you did not
enjoy them as i did; you appear tire the whole time i believ
you were glad we danc no longer; but i would have given worlds--
all the world one ever ha to give--for anoth half-hour

she play

what felic it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy!--
if i mistak not that wa danc at weymouth

she look up at him for a moment colour deepli and play
someth els he took some music from a chair near the pianofort
and turn to emma said

here is someth quit new to me do you know it?--cramer--
and here are a new set of irish melodi that from such a quarter
one might expect thi wa all sent with the instrument veri thought
of colonel campbel wa not it?--h knew miss fairfax could have
no music here i honour that part of the attent particularly;
it shew it to have been so thoroughli from the heart noth hastili
done; noth incomplet true affect onli could have prompt it

emma wish he would be less point yet could not help be amused;
and when on glanc her eye toward jane fairfax she caught
the remain of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush
of conscious there had been a smile of secret delight
she had less scrupl in the amus and much less compunct
with respect to her--thi amiabl upright perfect jane fairfax
wa appar cherish veri reprehens feel

he brought all the music to her and they look it over together--
emma took the opportun of whisper

you speak too plain she must understand you

i hope she doe i would have her understand me i am not
in the least asham of my mean

but realli i am half asham and wish i had never taken up
the idea

i am veri glad you did and that you commun it to me
i have now a key to all her odd look and way leav shame to her
if she doe wrong she ought to feel it

she is not entir without it i think

i do not see much sign of it she is play _robin_ _adair_
at thi moment--_his_ favourit

shortli afterward miss bate pass near the window
descri mr knightley on horse-back not far off

mr knightley i declare!--i must speak to him if possibl
just to thank him i will not open the window here; it would give
you all cold; but i can go into my mother room you know i dare
say he will come in when he know who is here quit delight
to have you all meet so!--our littl room so honoured!

chapter xi


it may be possibl to do without danc entir instanc have
been known of young peopl pass mani mani month success
without be at ani ball of ani descript and no materi injuri
accru either to bodi or mind;--but when a begin is made--
when the felic of rapid motion have onc been though slightli
felt--it must be a veri heavi set that doe not ask for more

frank churchil had danc onc at highburi and long to danc again;
and the last half-hour of an even which mr woodhous wa persuad
to spend with hi daughter at randal wa pass by the two young
peopl in scheme on the subject frank wa the first idea;
and hi the greatest zeal in pursu it; for the ladi wa the best
judg of the difficulti and the most solicit for accommod
and appear but still she had inclin enough for shew
peopl again how delight mr frank churchil and miss
woodhous danced--for do that in which she need not blush to compar
herself with jane fairfax--and even for simpl danc itself
without ani of the wick aid of vanity--to assist him first
in pace out the room they were in to see what it could be made
to hold--and then in take the dimens of the other parlour
in the hope of discov in spite of all that mr weston could
say of their exactli equal size that it wa a littl the largest

hi first proposit and request that the danc begun at mr cole
should be finish there--that the same parti should be collect
and the same musician engag met with the readiest acquiesc
mr weston enter into the idea with thorough enjoy
and mr weston most willingli undertook to play as long as they
could wish to dance; and the interest employ had follow
of reckon up exactli who there would be and portion out the
indispens divis of space to everi coupl

you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two
miss cox five had been repeat mani time over and there
will be the two gilbert young cox my father and myself
besid mr knightley ye that will be quit enough for pleasur
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss
cox five; and for five coupl there will be plenti of room

but soon it came to be on one side

but will there be good room for five couple?--i realli do not think
there will

on anoth

and after all five coupl are not enough to make it worth
while to stand up five coupl are noth when one think
serious about it it will not do to _invite_ five coupl
it can be allow onli as the thought of the moment

somebodi said that _miss_ gilbert wa expect at her brother
and must be invit with the rest somebodi els believ
_mrs_ gilbert would have danc the other even if she had
been ask a word wa put in for a second young cox; and at last
mr weston name one famili of cousin who must be includ
and anoth of veri old acquaint who could not be left out
it becam a certainti that the five coupl would be at least ten
and a veri interest specul in what possibl manner they
could be dispos of

the door of the two room were just opposit each other
might not they use both room and danc across the passage?
it seem the best scheme; and yet it wa not so good but that
mani of them want a better emma said it would be awkward;
mr weston wa in distress about the supper; and mr woodhous
oppos it earnestli on the score of health it made him so
veri unhappi inde that it could not be persev in

oh! no said he; it would be the extrem of imprud
i could not bear it for emma!--emma is not strong she would
catch a dread cold so would poor littl harriet
so you would all mr weston you would be quit laid up;
do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them
talk of it that young man (speak lower) is veri thoughtless
do not tell hi father but that young man is not quit the thing
he ha been open the door veri often thi even and keep
them open veri inconsider he doe not think of the draught
i do not mean to set you against him but inde he is not quit
the thing!

mr weston wa sorri for such a charg she knew the import
of it and said everi thing in her power to do it away everi door
wa now close the passag plan given up and the first scheme
of danc onli in the room they were in resort to again;
and with such good-wil on frank churchil part that the space
which a quarter of an hour befor had been deem bare suffici
for five coupl wa now endeavour to be made out quit enough
for ten

we were too magnific said he we allow unnecessari room
ten coupl may stand here veri well

emma demur it would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could
be wors than danc without space to turn in?

veri true he grave replied; it wa veri bad but still he
went on measur and still he end with

i think there will be veri toler room for ten coupl

no no said she you are quit unreason it would be dread
to be stand so close! noth can be farther from pleasur
than to be danc in a crowd--and a crowd in a littl room!

there is no deni it he repli i agre with you exactli
a crowd in a littl room--miss woodhous you have the art of give
pictur in a few word exquisit quit exquisite!--stil howev
have proceed so far one is unwil to give the matter up
it would be a disappoint to my father--and altogether--i do
not know that--i am rather of opinion that ten coupl might stand
here veri well

emma perceiv that the natur of hi gallantri wa a littl
self-wil and that he would rather oppos than lose the pleasur
of danc with her; but she took the compliment and forgav
the rest had she intend ever to _marry_ him it might have been
worth while to paus and consid and tri to understand the valu
of hi prefer and the charact of hi temper; but for
all the purpos of their acquaint he wa quit amiabl enough

befor the middl of the next day he wa at hartfield; and he enter
the room with such an agreeabl smile as certifi the continu
of the scheme it soon appear that he came to announc an improv

well miss woodhous he almost immedi began your inclin
for danc ha not been quit frighten away i hope by the
terror of my father littl room i bring a new propos
on the subject:--a thought of my father which wait onli your
approb to be act upon may i hope for the honour of your
hand for the two first danc of thi littl project ball
to be given not at randal but at the crown inn?

the crown!

yes; if you and mr woodhous see no object and i trust you cannot
my father hope hi friend will be so kind as to visit him there
better accommod he can promis them and not a less grate
welcom than at randal it is hi own idea mr weston see
no object to it provid you are satisfi thi is what we
all feel oh! you were perfectli right! ten coupl in either of
the randal room would have been insufferable!--dreadful!--i felt
how right you were the whole time but wa too anxiou for secur
_any_ _thing_ to like to yield is not it a good exchange?--y consent--
i hope you consent?

it appear to me a plan that nobodi can object to if mr and
mr weston do not i think it admirable; and as far as i can
answer for myself shall be most happy--it seem the onli improv
that could be papa do you not think it an excel improvement?

she wa oblig to repeat and explain it befor it wa fulli
comprehended; and then be quit new farther represent
were necessari to make it accept

no; he thought it veri far from an improvement--a veri bad plan--
much wors than the other a room at an inn wa alway damp
and dangerous; never properli air or fit to be inhabit
if they must danc they had better danc at randal he had never
been in the room at the crown in hi life--did not know the peopl
who kept it by sight--oh! no--a veri bad plan they would catch
wors cold at the crown than anywher

i wa go to observ sir said frank churchil
that one of the great recommend of thi chang would
be the veri littl danger of ani bodi catch cold--
so much less danger at the crown than at randalls! mr perri
might have reason to regret the alter but nobodi els could

sir said mr woodhous rather warmli you are veri much
mistaken if you suppos mr perri to be that sort of charact
mr perri is extrem concern when ani of us are ill but i
do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you
than your father hous

from the veri circumst of it be larger sir we shall have
no occas to open the window at all--not onc the whole evening;
and it is that dread habit of open the window let in cold
air upon heat bodi which (a you well know sir) doe the mischief

open the windows!--but sure mr churchil nobodi would think
of open the window at randal nobodi could be so imprudent!
i never heard of such a thing danc with open windows!--i am sure
neither your father nor mr weston (poor miss taylor that was)
would suffer it

ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometim step behind
a window-curtain and throw up a sash without it be suspect
i have often known it done myself

have you inde sir?--bless me! i never could have suppos it
but i live out of the world and am often astonish at what i hear
howev thi doe make a difference; and perhap when we come
to talk it over--but these sort of thing requir a good deal
of consider one cannot resolv upon them in a hurri
if mr and mr weston will be so oblig as to call here one morn
we may talk it over and see what can be done

but unfortun sir my time is so limited--

oh! interrupt emma there will be plenti of time for talk
everi thing over there is no hurri at all if it can be contriv
to be at the crown papa it will be veri conveni for the hors
they will be so near their own stabl

so they will my dear that is a great thing not that jame
ever complains; but it is right to spare our hors when we can
if i could be sure of the room be thoroughli aired--but is
mr stoke to be trusted? i doubt it i do not know her
even by sight

i can answer for everi thing of that natur sir becaus it will
be under mr weston care mr weston undertak to direct
the whole

there papa!--now you must be satisfied--our own dear mr weston
who is care itself do not you rememb what mr perri said
so mani year ago when i had the measles? `if _miss_ _taylor_ undertak
to wrap miss emma up you need not have ani fear sir how often
have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!

aye veri true mr perri did say so i shall never forget it
poor littl emma! you were veri bad with the measles; that is
you would have been veri bad but for perri great attent
he came four time a day for a week he said from the first
it wa a veri good sort--which wa our great comfort; but the measl
are a dread complaint i hope whenev poor isabella littl one
have the measl she will send for perri

my father and mr weston are at the crown at thi moment
said frank churchil examin the capabl of the hous
i left them there and came on to hartfield impati for your opinion
and hope you might be persuad to join them and give your advic
on the spot i wa desir to say so from both it would be the
greatest pleasur to them if you could allow me to attend you there
they can do noth satisfactorili without you

emma wa most happi to be call to such a council; and her father
engag to think it all over while she wa gone the two young
peopl set off togeth without delay for the crown there were
mr and mr weston; delight to see her and receiv her approb
veri busi and veri happi in their differ way; she in some
littl distress; and he find everi thing perfect

emma said she thi paper is wors than i expect
look! in place you see it is dread dirty; and the wainscot
is more yellow and forlorn than ani thing i could have imagin

my dear you are too particular said her husband what doe
all that signify? you will see noth of it by candlelight
it will be as clean as randal by candlelight we never see ani
thing of it on our club-night

the ladi here probabl exchang look which meant men never
know when thing are dirti or not; and the gentlemen perhap
thought each to himself women will have their littl nonsens
and needless care

one perplex howev aros which the gentlemen did not disdain
it regard a supper-room at the time of the ballroom be built
supper had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoin
wa the onli addit what wa to be done? thi card-room would
be want as a card-room now; or if card were conveni vote
unnecessari by their four selv still wa it not too small for
ani comfort supper? anoth room of much better size might be
secur for the purpose; but it wa at the other end of the hous
and a long awkward passag must be gone through to get at it
thi made a difficulti mr weston wa afraid of draught
for the young peopl in that passage; and neither emma nor the
gentlemen could toler the prospect of be miser crowd
at supper

mr weston propos have no regular supper; mere sandwich
&c set out in the littl room; but that wa scout as a
wretch suggest a privat danc without sit down to supper
wa pronounc an infam fraud upon the right of men and women;
and mr weston must not speak of it again she then took anoth
line of expedi and look into the doubt room observ

i do not think it _is_ so veri small we shall not be mani
you know

and mr weston at the same time walk briskli with long step
through the passag wa call out

you talk a great deal of the length of thi passag my dear
it is a mere noth after all; and not the least draught from
the stair

i wish said mr weston one could know which arrang our
guest in gener would like best to do what would be most gener
pleas must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be

ye veri true cri frank veri true you want your neighbour
opinion i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the
chief of them--th cole for instanc they are not far off
shall i call upon them? or miss bates? she is still nearer--
and i do not know whether miss bate is not as like to understand
the inclin of the rest of the peopl as ani bodi i think
we do want a larger council suppos i go and invit miss bate
to join us?

well--if you pleas said mr weston rather hesit if you
think she will be of ani use

you will get noth to the purpos from miss bate said emma
she will be all delight and gratitud but she will tell you noth
she will not even listen to your question i see no advantag in
consult miss bate

but she is so amus so extrem amusing! i am veri fond
of hear miss bate talk and i need not bring the whole famili
you know

here mr weston join them and on hear what wa propos
gave it hi decid approb

aye do frank--go and fetch miss bate and let us end the matter
at onc she will enjoy the scheme i am sure; and i do not know
a proper person for shew us how to do away difficulti
fetch miss bate we are grow a littl too nice she is
a stand lesson of how to be happi but fetch them both
invit them both

both sir! can the old lady?

the old lady! no the young ladi to be sure i shall think you
a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niec

oh! i beg your pardon sir i did not immedi recollect
undoubtedli if you wish it i will endeavour to persuad them both
and away he ran

long befor he reappear attend the short neat brisk-mov aunt
and her eleg niece--mr weston like a sweet-temp
woman and a good wife had examin the passag again
and found the evil of it much less than she had suppos before--
inde veri trifling; and here end the difficulti of decis
all the rest in specul at least wa perfectli smooth
all the minor arrang of tabl and chair light and music
tea and supper made themselves; or were left as mere trifl
to be settl at ani time between mr weston and mr stokes--
everi bodi invit wa certainli to come; frank had alreadi written
to enscomb to propos stay a few day beyond hi fortnight
which could not possibl be refus and a delight danc it wa
to be

most cordial when miss bate arriv did she agre that it must
as a counsellor she wa not wanted; but as an approv (a much
safer character) she wa truli welcom her approb at onc
gener and minut warm and incess could not but please;
and for anoth half-hour they were all walk to and fro
between the differ room some suggest some attend
and all in happi enjoy of the futur the parti did not break
up without emma be posit secur for the two first danc
by the hero of the even nor without her overhear mr weston
whisper to hi wife he ha ask her my dear that right
i knew he would!



chapter xii


one thing onli wa want to make the prospect of the ball
complet satisfactori to emma--it be fix for a day within
the grant term of frank churchil stay in surry; for in spite
of mr weston confid she could not think it so veri imposs
that the churchil might not allow their nephew to remain
a day beyond hi fortnight but thi wa not judg feasibl
the prepar must take their time noth could be properli
readi till the third week were enter on and for a few day they
must be plan proceed and hope in uncertainty--at the risk--
in her opinion the great risk of it be all in vain

enscomb howev wa graciou graciou in fact if not in word
hi wish of stay longer evid did not please; but it wa
not oppos all wa safe and prosperous; and as the remov of one
solicitud gener make way for anoth emma be now certain
of her ball began to adopt as the next vexat mr knightley
provok indiffer about it either becaus he did not
danc himself or becaus the plan had been form without hi
be consult he seem resolv that it should not interest him
determin against it excit ani present curios or afford
him ani futur amus to her voluntari commun emma
could get no more approv repli than

veri well if the weston think it worth while to be at all thi
troubl for a few hour of noisi entertain i have noth
to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasur for me--
oh! ye i must be there; i could not refuse; and i will keep
as much awak as i can; but i would rather be at home look over
william larkinss week account; much rather i confess--
pleasur in see dancing!--not i indeed--i never look at it--
i do not know who does--fin danc i believ like virtu
must be it own reward those who are stand by are usual
think of someth veri differ

thi emma felt wa aim at her; and it made her quit angri
it wa not in compliment to jane fairfax howev that he wa
so indiffer or so indignant; he wa not guid by _her_ feel
in reprob the ball for _she_ enjoy the thought of it
to an extraordinari degre it made her animated--open hearted--
she voluntarili said;--

oh! miss woodhous i hope noth may happen to prevent the ball
what a disappoint it would be! i do look forward to it i own
with _very_ great pleasur

it wa not to oblig jane fairfax therefor that he would have
prefer the societi of william larkin no!--sh wa more and more
convinc that mr weston wa quit mistaken in that surmis
there wa a great deal of friendli and of compassion attach
on hi side--but no love

alas! there wa soon no leisur for quarrel with mr knightley
two day of joy secur were immedi follow by the
over-throw of everi thing a letter arriv from mr churchil
to urg hi nephew instant return mr churchil wa unwell--
far too unwel to do without him; she had been in a veri suffer
state (so said her husband) when write to her nephew two day befor
though from her usual unwilling to give pain and constant
habit of never think of herself she had not mention it;
but now she wa too ill to trifl and must entreat him to set off
for enscomb without delay

the substanc of thi letter wa forward to emma in a note
from mr weston instantli as to hi go it wa inevit
he must be gone within a few hour though without feel ani real
alarm for hi aunt to lessen hi repugn he knew her illnesses;
they never occur but for her own conveni

mr weston ad that he could onli allow himself time to
hurri to highburi after breakfast and take leav of the few
friend there whom he could suppos to feel ani interest in him;
and that he might be expect at hartfield veri soon

thi wretch note wa the final of emma breakfast when onc
it had been read there wa no do ani thing but lament
and exclaim the loss of the ball--th loss of the young man--
and all that the young man might be feeling!--it wa too wretched!--
such a delight even as it would have been!--everi bodi so happy!
and she and her partner the happiest!--i said it would be so
wa the onli consol

her father feel were quit distinct he thought princip
of mr churchil ill and want to know how she wa treated;
and as for the ball it wa shock to have dear emma disappointed;
but they would all be safer at home

emma wa readi for her visitor some time befor he appeared;
but if thi reflect at all upon hi impati hi sorrow
look and total want of spirit when he did come might redeem him
he felt the go away almost too much to speak of it hi deject
wa most evid he sat realli lost in thought for the first
few minutes; and when rous himself it wa onli to say

of all horrid thing leave-tak is the worst

but you will come again said emma thi will not be your onli
visit to randal

ah!--(shak hi head)--th uncertainti of when i may be abl
to return!--i shall tri for it with a zeal!--it will be the object
of all my thought and cares!--and if my uncl and aunt go to town
thi spring--but i am afraid--they did not stir last spring--
i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever

our poor ball must be quit given up

ah! that ball!--whi did we wait for ani thing?--whi not seiz the
pleasur at once?--how often is happi destroy by prepar
foolish preparation!--y told us it would be so--oh! miss woodhous
whi are you alway so right?

inde i am veri sorri to be right in thi instanc i would
much rather have been merri than wise

if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father
depend on it do not forget your engag

emma look gracious

such a fortnight as it ha been! he continued; everi day more
preciou and more delight than the day before!--everi day make
me less fit to bear ani other place happi those who can remain
at highbury!

as you do us such ampl justic now said emma laugh i will
ventur to ask whether you did not come a littl doubt at first?
do not we rather surpass your expectations? i am sure we do
i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been
so long in come if you had had a pleasant idea of highburi

he laugh rather consciously; and though deni the sentiment
emma wa convinc that it had been so

and you must be off thi veri morning?

yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back togeth
and i must be off immedi i am almost afraid that everi moment
will bring him

not five minut to spare even for your friend miss fairfax and
miss bates? how unlucky! miss batess power argument mind
might have strengthen your

yes--i _have_ call there; pass the door i thought it better
it wa a right thing to do i went in for three minut and wa
detain by miss batess be absent she wa out; and i felt it
imposs not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may
that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight
it wa better to pay my visit then--

he hesit got up walk to a window

in short said he perhap miss woodhouse--i think you can
hardli be quit without suspicion--

he look at her as if want to read her thought she hardli
knew what to say it seem like the forerunn of someth
absolut seriou which she did not wish forc herself
to speak therefor in the hope of put it by she calmli said

you are quit in the right; it wa most natur to pay your visit then--

he wa silent she believ he wa look at her; probabl reflect
on what she had said and tri to understand the manner
she heard him sigh it wa natur for him to feel that he had
_cause_ to sigh he could not believ her to be encourag him
a few awkward moment pass and he sat down again; and in a more
determin manner said

it wa someth to feel that all the rest of my time might be
given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm--

he stopt again rose again and seem quit embarrassed--
he wa more in love with her than emma had supposed; and who can say
how it might have end if hi father had not made hi appearance?
mr woodhous soon followed; and the necess of exert made
him compos

a veri few minut more howev complet the present trial
mr weston alway alert when busi wa to be done and as
incap of procrastin ani evil that wa inevit
as of forese ani that wa doubt said it wa time to go;
and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agre
to take leav

i shall hear about you all said he; that is my chief consol
i shall hear of everi thing that is go on among you i have
engag mr weston to correspond with me she ha been so kind as
to promis it oh! the bless of a femal correspond when one
is realli interest in the absent!--sh will tell me everi thing
in her letter i shall be at dear highburi again

a veri friendli shake of the hand a veri earnest good-by
close the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchil
short had been the notice--short their meeting; he wa gone; and emma
felt so sorri to part and foresaw so great a loss to their littl
societi from hi absenc as to begin to be afraid of be too sorri
and feel it too much

it wa a sad chang they had been meet almost everi day
sinc hi arriv certainli hi be at randal had given
great spirit to the last two weeks--indescrib spirit; the idea
the expect of see him which everi morn had brought
the assur of hi attent hi liveli hi manners!
it had been a veri happi fortnight and forlorn must be the sink
from it into the common cours of hartfield day to complet everi
other recommend he had _almost_ told her that he love her
what strength or what constanc of affect he might be subject to
wa anoth point; but at present she could not doubt hi have
a decidedli warm admir a consciou prefer of herself;
and thi persuas join to all the rest made her think that
she _must_ be a littl in love with him in spite of everi previou
determin against it

i certainli must said she thi sensat of listless
weari stupid thi disinclin to sit down and employ myself
thi feel of everi thing be dull and insipid about the house!--
i must be in love; i should be the oddest creatur in the world if i
were not--for a few week at least well! evil to some is alway
good to other i shall have mani fellow-mourn for the ball
if not for frank churchill; but mr knightley will be happi
he may spend the even with hi dear william larkin now if he like

mr knightley howev shew no triumphant happi he could
not say that he wa sorri on hi own account; hi veri cheer look
would have contradict him if he had; but he said and veri steadili
that he wa sorri for the disappoint of the other and with
consider kind ad

you emma who have so few opportun of danc you are realli
out of luck; you are veri much out of luck!

it wa some day befor she saw jane fairfax to judg of her
honest regret in thi woeful change; but when they did meet
her composur wa odiou she had been particularli unwel howev
suffer from headach to a degre which made her aunt declar
that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have
attend it; and it wa chariti to imput some of her unbecom

chapter xiii


emma continu to entertain no doubt of her be in love her idea
onli vari as to the how much at first she thought it wa a good deal;
and afterward but littl she had great pleasur in hear frank
churchil talk of; and for hi sake greater pleasur than ever
in see mr and mr weston; she wa veri often think of him
and quit impati for a letter that she might know how he wa
how were hi spirit how wa hi aunt and what wa the chanc
of hi come to randal again thi spring but on the other hand
she could not admit herself to be unhappi nor after the
first morn to be less dispos for employ than usual;
she wa still busi and cheerful; and pleas as he wa she could
yet imagin him to have faults; and farther though think of him
so much and as she sat draw or work form a thousand
amus scheme for the progress and close of their attach
fanci interest dialogu and invent eleg letters;
the conclus of everi imaginari declar on hi side wa that she
_refused_ _him_ their affect wa alway to subsid into friendship
everi thing tender and charm wa to mark their parting;
but still they were to part when she becam sensibl of thi
it struck her that she could not be veri much in love; for in spite
of her previou and fix determin never to quit her father
never to marri a strong attach certainli must produc more
of a struggl than she could forese in her own feel

i do not find myself make ani use of the word _sacrifice_ said she--
in not one of all my clever repli my delic neg
is there ani allus to make a sacrific i do suspect that he
is not realli necessari to my happi so much the better
i certainli will not persuad myself to feel more than i do i am
quit enough in love i should be sorri to be more

upon the whole she wa equal content with her view of hi feel

_he_ is undoubtedli veri much in love--everi thing denot it--veri much
in love indeed!--and when he come again if hi affect continu
i must be on my guard not to encourag it--it would be most
inexcus to do otherwis as my own mind is quit made up
not that i imagin he can think i have been encourag him hitherto
no if he had believ me at all to share hi feel he would
not have been so wretch could he have thought himself encourag
hi look and languag at part would have been different--
still howev i must be on my guard thi is in the supposit
of hi attach continu what it now is; but i do not know that i
expect it will; i do not look upon him to be quit the sort of man--
i do not altogeth build upon hi steadi or constancy--
hi feel are warm but i can imagin them rather changeable--
everi consider of the subject in short make me thank
that my happi is not more deepli involved--i shall do veri well
again after a littl while--and then it will be a good thing over;
for they say everi bodi is in love onc in their live and i shall
have been let off easili

when hi letter to mr weston arriv emma had the perus of it;
and she read it with a degre of pleasur and admir which made
her at first shake her head over her own sensat and think she
had undervalu their strength it wa a long well-written letter
give the particular of hi journey and of hi feel
express all the affect gratitud and respect which wa
natur and honour and describ everi thing exterior and local
that could be suppos attract with spirit and precis
no suspici flourish now of apolog or concern; it wa the
languag of real feel toward mr weston; and the transit
from highburi to enscomb the contrast between the place in some
of the first bless of social life wa just enough touch on
to shew how keenli it wa felt and how much more might have been
said but for the restraint of propriety--th charm of her own
name wa not want _miss_ _woodhouse_ appear more than onc
and never without a someth of pleas connexion either a
compliment to her tast or a remembr of what she had said;
and in the veri last time of it meet her eye unadorn as it
wa by ani such broad wreath of gallantri she yet could discern
the effect of her influenc and acknowledg the greatest compliment
perhap of all convey compress into the veri lowest vacant
corner were these words--i had not a spare moment on tuesday
as you know for miss woodhous beauti littl friend pray make
my excus and adieu to her thi emma could not doubt wa all
for herself harriet wa rememb onli from be _her_ friend
hi inform and prospect as to enscomb were neither wors nor
better than had been anticipated; mr churchil wa recov
and he dare not yet even in hi own imagin fix a time for
come to randal again

gratifi howev and stimul as wa the letter in the
materi part it sentiment she yet found when it wa fold up
and return to mr weston that it had not ad ani last warmth
that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn
to do without her her intent were unchang her resolut
of refus onli grew more interest by the addit of a scheme for
hi subsequ consol and happi hi recollect of harriet
and the word which cloth it the beauti littl friend
suggest to her the idea of harriet succeed her in hi affect
wa it impossible?--no--harriet undoubtedli wa greatli hi
inferior in understanding; but he had been veri much struck with
the loveli of her face and the warm simplic of her manner;
and all the probabl of circumst and connexion were in
her favour--for harriet it would be advantag and delight inde

i must not dwell upon it said she--i must not think of it
i know the danger of indulg such specul but stranger
thing have happened; and when we ceas to care for each other
as we do now it will be the mean of confirm us in that sort
of true disinterest friendship which i can alreadi look forward
to with pleasur

it wa well to have a comfort in store on harriet behalf
though it might be wise to let the fanci touch it seldom; for evil
in that quarter wa at hand as frank churchil arriv had
succeed mr elton engag in the convers of highburi
as the latest interest had entir born down the first so now
upon frank churchil disappear mr elton concern were
assum the most irresist form--hi wedding-day wa name
he would soon be among them again; mr elton and hi bride
there wa hardli time to talk over the first letter from enscomb
befor mr elton and hi bride wa in everi bodi mouth
and frank churchil wa forgotten emma grew sick at the sound
she had had three week of happi exempt from mr elton;
and harriet mind she had been will to hope had been late
gain strength with mr weston ball in view at least
there had been a great deal of insens to other things;
but it wa now too evid that she had not attain such a state
of composur as could stand against the actual approach--new carriag
bell-ring and all

poor harriet wa in a flutter of spirit which requir all the
reason and sooth and attent of everi kind that emma
could give emma felt that she could not do too much for her
that harriet had a right to all her ingenu and all her patience;
but it wa heavi work to be for ever convinc without produc
ani effect for ever agre to without be abl to make their opinion
the same harriet listen submiss and said it wa veri true--
it wa just as miss woodhous described--it wa not worth while to
think about them--and she would not think about them ani longer
but no chang of subject could avail and the next half-hour
saw her as anxiou and restless about the elton as befor
at last emma attack her on anoth ground

your allow yourself to be so occupi and so unhappi about
mr elton marri harriet is the strongest reproach you can
make _me_ you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistak i
fell into it wa all my do i know i have not forgotten it
i assur you--deceiv myself i did veri miser deceiv you--
and it will be a pain reflect to me for ever do not imagin
me in danger of forget it

harriet felt thi too much to utter more than a few word
of eager exclam emma continu

i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake; think less
talk less of mr elton for my sake; becaus for your own sake rather
i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more import
than my comfort a habit of self-command in you a consider
of what is your duti an attent to proprieti an endeavour
to avoid the suspicion of other to save your health and credit
and restor your tranquil these are the motiv which i
have been press on you they are veri important--and sorri
i am that you cannot feel them suffici to act upon them
my be save from pain is a veri secondari consider i want
you to save yourself from greater pain perhap i may sometim
have felt that harriet would not forget what wa due--or rather
what would be kind by me

thi appeal to her affect did more than all the rest
the idea of want gratitud and consider for miss woodhous
whom she realli love extrem made her wretch for a while
and when the violenc of grief wa comfort away still remain
power enough to prompt to what wa right and support her in it
veri toler

you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life--
want gratitud to you!--nobodi is equal to you!--i care for nobodi
as i do for you!--oh! miss woodhous how ungrat i have been!

such express assist as they were by everi thing that look
and manner could do made emma feel that she had never love harriet
so well nor valu her affect so highli befor

there is no charm equal to tender of heart said she
afterward to herself there is noth to be compar to it
warmth and tender of heart with an affection open manner
will beat all the clear of head in the world for attract
i am sure it will it is tender of heart which make my dear
father so gener beloved--which give isabella all her popularity--
i have it not--but i know how to prize and respect it--harriet is
my superior in all the charm and all the felic it give
dear harriet!--i would not chang you for the clearest-head
longest-sight best-judg femal breath oh! the cold
of a jane fairfax!--harriet is worth a hundr such--and for a wife--
a sensibl man wife--it is invalu i mention no names;
but happi the man who chang emma for harriet!



chapter xiv


mr elton wa first seen at church: but though devot might
be interrupt curios could not be satisfi by a bride in a pew
and it must be left for the visit in form which were then to be paid
to settl whether she were veri pretti inde or onli rather pretti
or not pretti at all

emma had feel less of curios than of pride or proprieti
to make her resolv on not be the last to pay her respects;
and she made a point of harriet go with her that the worst of
the busi might be gone through as soon as possibl

she could not enter the hous again could not be in the same room
to which she had with such vain artific retreat three month ago
to lace up her boot without _recollecting_ a thousand vexati
thought would recur compliment charad and horribl blunders;
and it wa not to be suppos that poor harriet should not be
recollect too; but she behav veri well and wa onli rather
pale and silent the visit wa of cours short; and there wa so
much embarrass and occup of mind to shorten it that emma
would not allow herself entir to form an opinion of the ladi
and on no account to give one beyond the nothing-mean term
of be elegantli dress and veri pleas

she did not realli like her she would not be in a hurri to find fault
but she suspect that there wa no elegance;--eas but not elegance--
she wa almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride
there wa too much eas her person wa rather good; her face
not unpretty; but neither featur nor air nor voic nor manner
were eleg emma thought at least it would turn out so

as for mr elton hi manner did not appear--but no she would
not permit a hasti or a witti word from herself about hi manner
it wa an awkward ceremoni at ani time to be receiv wed visit
and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it
the woman wa better off; she might have the assist of fine cloth
and the privileg of bash but the man had onli hi own
good sens to depend on; and when she consid how peculiarli
unlucki poor mr elton wa in be in the same room at onc with
the woman he had just marri the woman he had want to marri
and the woman whom he had been expect to marri she must allow him
to have the right to look as littl wise and to be as much affectedli
and as littl realli easi as could be

well miss woodhous said harriet when they had quit
the hous and after wait in vain for her friend to begin;
well miss woodhous (with a gentl sigh) what do you think of her?--
is not she veri charming?

there wa a littl hesit in emma answer

oh! yes--very--a veri pleas young woman

i think her beauti quit beauti

veri nice dress indeed; a remark eleg gown

i am not at all surpriz that he should have fallen in love

oh! no--ther is noth to surpriz one at all--a pretti fortune;
and she came in hi way

i dare say return harriet sigh again i dare say she
wa veri much attach to him

perhap she might; but it is not everi man fate to marri the
woman who love him best miss hawkin perhap want a home
and thought thi the best offer she wa like to have

ye said harriet earnestli and well she might nobodi could ever
have a better well i wish them happi with all my heart and now
miss woodhous i do not think i shall mind see them again
he is just as superior as ever;--but be marri you know
it is quit a differ thing no inde miss woodhous you need
not be afraid; i can sit and admir him now without ani great miseri
to know that he ha not thrown himself away is such a comfort!--
she doe seem a charm young woman just what he deserv
happi creature! he call her `augusta how delightful!

when the visit wa return emma made up her mind she could then
see more and judg better from harriet happen not to be
at hartfield and her father be present to engag mr elton
she had a quarter of an hour of the ladi convers to herself
and could composedli attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quit
convinc her that mr elton wa a vain woman extrem well
satisfi with herself and think much of her own importance;
that she meant to shine and be veri superior but with manner which
had been form in a bad school pert and familiar; that all her
notion were drawn from one set of peopl and one style of living;
that if not foolish she wa ignor and that her societi would
certainli do mr elton no good

harriet would have been a better match if not wise or refin herself
she would have connect him with those who were; but miss hawkin
it might be fairli suppos from her easi conceit had been the best
of her own set the rich brother-in-law near bristol wa the pride
of the allianc and hi place and hi carriag were the pride
of him

the veri first subject after be seat wa mapl grove my brother
mr suckl seat;--a comparison of hartfield to mapl grove
the ground of hartfield were small but neat and pretty; and the
hous wa modern and well-built mr elton seem most favour
impress by the size of the room the entranc and all that she
could see or imagin veri like mapl grove indeed!--sh wa quit
struck by the likeness!--that room wa the veri shape and size
of the morning-room at mapl grove; her sister favourit room--
mr elton wa appeal to--wa not it astonishingli like?--
she could realli almost fanci herself at mapl grove

and the staircase--y know as i came in i observ how veri like
the staircas was; place exactli in the same part of the hous
i realli could not help exclaiming! i assur you miss woodhous
it is veri delight to me to be remind of a place i am so
extrem partial to as mapl grove i have spent so mani happi
month there! (with a littl sigh of sentiment) a charm place
undoubtedli everi bodi who see it is struck by it beauty;
but to me it ha been quit a home whenev you are transplant
like me miss woodhous you will understand how veri delight it
is to meet with ani thing at all like what one ha left behind
i alway say thi is quit one of the evil of matrimoni

emma made as slight a repli as she could; but it wa fulli suffici
for mr elton who onli want to be talk herself

so extrem like mapl grove! and it is not mere the house--
the ground i assur you as far as i could observ are strikingli
like the laurel at mapl grove are in the same profus as here
and stand veri much in the same way--just across the lawn;
and i had a glimps of a fine larg tree with a bench round it
which put me so exactli in mind! my brother and sister will be
enchant with thi place peopl who have extens ground
themselv are alway pleas with ani thing in the same style

emma doubt the truth of thi sentiment she had a great idea
that peopl who had extens ground themselv care veri littl
for the extens ground of ani bodi else; but it wa not worth
while to attack an error so double-di and therefor onli said
in repli

when you have seen more of thi countri i am afraid you will think
you have overr hartfield surri is full of beauti

oh! ye i am quit awar of that it is the garden of england
you know surri is the garden of england

yes; but we must not rest our claim on that distinct
mani counti i believ are call the garden of england
as well as surri

no i fanci not repli mr elton with a most satisfi smile
i never heard ani counti but surri call so

emma wa silenc

my brother and sister have promis us a visit in the spring
or summer at farthest continu mr elton; and that will be
our time for explor while they are with us we shall explor
a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche-landau
of cours which hold four perfectly; and therefor without say
ani thing of _our_ carriag we should be abl to explor the differ
beauti extrem well they would hardli come in their chais
i think at that season of the year inde when the time draw on
i shall decidedli recommend their bring the barouche-landau;
it will be so veri much prefer when peopl come into a beauti
countri of thi sort you know miss woodhous one natur wish
them to see as much as possible; and mr suckl is extrem fond
of explor we explor to kings-weston twice last summer
in that way most delight just after their first have the
barouche-landau you have mani parti of that kind here i suppos
miss woodhous everi summer?

no; not immedi here we are rather out of distanc of the veri
strike beauti which attract the sort of parti you speak of;
and we are a veri quiet set of peopl i believe; more dispos
to stay at home than engag in scheme of pleasur

ah! there is noth like stay at home for real comfort
nobodi can be more devot to home than i am i wa quit
a proverb for it at mapl grove mani a time ha selina said
when she ha been go to bristol `i realli cannot get thi girl
to move from the hous i absolut must go in by myself though i
hate be stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;
but augusta i believ with her own good-wil would never stir
beyond the park pale mani a time ha she said so; and yet i
am no advoc for entir seclus i think on the contrari
when peopl shut themselv up entir from societi it is a veri
bad thing; and that it is much more advis to mix in the world in
a proper degre without live in it either too much or too littl
i perfectli understand your situat howev miss woodhouse--
(look toward mr woodhouse) your father state of health must
be a great drawback whi doe not he tri bath?--inde he should
let me recommend bath to you i assur you i have no doubt of it do
mr woodhous good

my father tri it more than onc formerly; but without receiv
ani benefit; and mr perri whose name i dare say is not unknown
to you doe not conceiv it would be at all more like to be
use now

ah! that a great pity; for i assur you miss woodhous
where the water do agre it is quit wonder the relief
they give in my bath life i have seen such instanc of it!
and it is so cheer a place that it could not fail of be of
use to mr woodhous spirit which i understand are sometim
much depress and as to it recommend to _you_ i fanci i
need not take much pain to dwell on them the advantag of bath
to the young are pretti gener understood it would be a charm
introduct for you who have live so seclud a life; and i could
immedi secur you some of the best societi in the place
a line from me would bring you a littl host of acquaintance; and my
particular friend mr partridg the ladi i have alway resid
with when in bath would be most happi to shew you ani attent
and would be the veri person for you to go into public with

it wa as much as emma could bear without be impolit
the idea of her be indebt to mr elton for what wa call
an _introduction_--of her go into public under the auspic
of a friend of mr eltons--prob some vulgar dash widow
who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live!--
the digniti of miss woodhous of hartfield wa sunk indeed!

she restrain herself howev from ani of the reproof she could
have given and onli thank mr elton coolly; but their go
to bath wa quit out of the question; and she wa not perfectli
convinc that the place might suit her better than her father
and then to prevent farther outrag and indign chang the
subject directli

i do not ask whether you are music mr elton upon these occas
a ladi charact gener preced her; and highburi ha long
known that you are a superior perform

oh! no indeed; i must protest against ani such idea
a superior performer!--veri far from it i assur you
consid from how partial a quarter your inform came
i am doatingli fond of music--passion fond;--and my friend
say i am not entir devoid of taste; but as to ani thing els
upon my honour my perform is _mediocre_ to the last degre
you miss woodhous i well know play delight i assur you
it ha been the greatest satisfact comfort and delight to me
to hear what a music societi i am got into i absolut cannot
do without music it is a necessari of life to me; and have alway
been use to a veri music societi both at mapl grove and in bath
it would have been a most seriou sacrific i honestli said as much
to mr e when he wa speak of my futur home and express
hi fear lest the retir of it should be disagreeable;
and the inferior of the hous too--know what i had been
accustom to--of cours he wa not wholli without apprehens
when he wa speak of it in that way i honestli said that _the_
_world_ i could give up--parti ball plays--for i had no fear
of retir bless with so mani resourc within myself
the world wa not necessari to _me_ i could do veri well without it
to those who had no resourc it wa a differ thing; but my
resourc made me quit independ and as to smaller-s room
than i had been use to i realli could not give it a thought
i hope i wa perfectli equal to ani sacrific of that descript
certainli i had been accustom to everi luxuri at mapl grove; but i
did assur him that two carriag were not necessari to my happi
nor were spaciou apart `but said i `to be quit honest
i do not think i can live without someth of a music societi
i condit for noth else; but without music life would be a blank
to me

we cannot suppos said emma smile that mr elton would hesit
to assur you of there be a _very_ music societi in highbury;
and i hope you will not find he ha outstep the truth more than
may be pardon in consider of the motiv

no inde i have no doubt at all on that head i am delight
to find myself in such a circl i hope we shall have mani sweet
littl concert togeth i think miss woodhous you and i
must establish a music club and have regular weekli meet
at your hous or our will not it be a good plan? if _we_
exert ourselv i think we shall not be long in want of alli
someth of that natur would be particularli desir for _me_
as an induc to keep me in practice; for marri women you know--
there is a sad stori against them in gener they are but too apt
to give up music

but you who are so extrem fond of it--ther can
be no danger surely?

i should hope not; but realli when i look around among my acquaint
i trembl selina ha entir given up music--nev touch
the instrument--though she play sweetli and the same may be said
of mr jeffereys--clara partridg that was--and of the two milman
now mr bird and mr jame cooper; and of more than i can enumer
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i use to be
quit angri with selina; but realli i begin now to comprehend
that a marri woman ha mani thing to call her attent
i believ i wa half an hour thi morn shut up with my housekeep

but everi thing of that kind said emma will soon
be in so regular a train--

well said mr elton laugh we shall see

emma find her so determin upon neglect her music
had noth more to say; and after a moment paus mr elton
chose anoth subject

we have been call at randal said she and found them
both at home; and veri pleasant peopl they seem to be
i like them extrem mr weston seem an excel creature--
quit a first-rat favourit with me alreadi i assur you
and _she_ appear so truli good--ther is someth so motherli
and kind-heart about her that it win upon one directli
she wa your gover i think?

emma wa almost too much astonish to answer; but mr elton
hardli wait for the affirm befor she went on

have understood as much i wa rather astonish to find her
so veri lady-like! but she is realli quit the gentlewoman

mr weston manner said emma were alway particularli good
their proprieti simplic and eleg would make them the safest
model for ani young woman

and who do you think came in while we were there?

emma wa quit at a loss the tone impli some old acquaintance--
and how could she possibl guess?

knightley! continu mr elton; knightley himself!--wa not
it lucky?--for not be within when he call the other day
i had never seen him before; and of cours as so particular a
friend of mr es i had a great curios `mi friend knightley
had been so often mention that i wa realli impati to see him;
and i must do my caro sposo the justic to say that he need not
be asham of hi friend knightley is quit the gentleman
i like him veri much decidedli i think a veri gentleman-lik man

happili it wa now time to be gone they were off; and emma
could breath

insuffer woman! wa her immedi exclam wors than i
had suppos absolut insufferable! knightley!--i could not
have believ it knightley!--nev seen him in her life befor
and call him knightley!--and discov that he is a gentleman!
a littl upstart vulgar be with her mr e and her _caro_ _sposo_
and her resourc and all her air of pert pretens and
underbr fineri actual to discov that mr knightley is
a gentleman! i doubt whether he will return the compliment
and discov her to be a ladi i could not have believ it!
and to propos that she and i should unit to form a music club!
one would fanci we were bosom friends! and mr weston!--
astonish that the person who had brought me up should be
a gentlewoman! wors and wors i never met with her equal
much beyond my hope harriet is disgrac by ani comparison
oh! what would frank churchil say to her if he were here?
how angri and how divert he would be! ah! there i am--
think of him directli alway the first person to be thought of!
how i catch myself out! frank churchil come as regularli into
my mind!--

all thi ran so glibli through her thought that by the time
her father had arrang himself after the bustl of the elton
departur and wa readi to speak she wa veri toler capabl
of attend

well my dear he deliber began consid we never saw
her befor she seem a veri pretti sort of young lady; and i dare say
she wa veri much pleas with you she speak a littl too quick
a littl quick of voic there is which rather hurt the ear
but i believ i am nice; i do not like strang voices; and nobodi speak
like you and poor miss taylor howev she seem a veri oblig
pretty-behav young ladi and no doubt will make him a veri good wife
though i think he had better not have marri i made the best
excus i could for not have been abl to wait on him and mr elton
on thi happi occasion; i said that i hope i _should_ in the cours
of the summer but i ought to have gone befor not to wait upon
a bride is veri remiss ah! it shew what a sad invalid i am!
but i do not like the corner into vicarag lane

i dare say your apolog were accept sir mr elton know you

yes: but a young lady--a bride--i ought to have paid my respect
to her if possibl it wa be veri defici

but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony; and therefor
whi should you be so anxiou to pay your respect to a _bride_?
it ought to be no recommend to _you_ it is encourag peopl
to marri if you make so much of them

no my dear i never encourag ani bodi to marri but i would
alway wish to pay everi proper attent to a lady--and a bride
especi is never to be neglect more is avowedli due to _her_
a bride you know my dear is alway the first in compani
let the other be who they may

well papa if thi is not encourag to marri i do not know
what is and i should never have expect you to be lend your
sanction to such vanity-bait for poor young ladi

my dear you do not understand me thi is a
matter of mere common polit and good-breed
and ha noth to do with ani encourag to peopl to marri

emma had done her father wa grow nervou and could not
understand _her_ her mind return to mr elton offenc
and long veri long did they occupi her



chapter xv


emma wa not requir by ani subsequ discoveri to retract her ill
opinion of mr elton her observ had been pretti correct
such as mr elton appear to her on thi second interview
such she appear whenev they met again--self-import presum
familiar ignor and ill-br she had a littl beauti and a
littl accomplish but so littl judgment that she thought herself
come with superior knowledg of the world to enliven and improv
a countri neighbourhood; and conceiv miss hawkin to have held
such a place in societi as mr elton consequ onli could surpass

there wa no reason to suppos mr elton thought at all differ
from hi wife he seem not mere happi with her but proud
he had the air of congratul himself on have brought such
a woman to highburi as not even miss woodhous could equal;
and the greater part of her new acquaint dispos to commend
or not in the habit of judg follow the lead of miss batess
good-wil or take it for grant that the bride must be as clever
and as agreeabl as she profess herself were veri well satisfied;
so that mr elton prais pass from one mouth to anoth as it
ought to do unimped by miss woodhous who readili continu her
first contribut and talk with a good grace of her be veri
pleasant and veri elegantli dress

in one respect mr elton grew even wors than she had appear
at first her feel alter toward emma--offend probabl
by the littl encourag which her propos of intimaci met with
she drew back in her turn and gradual becam much more cold
and distant; and though the effect wa agreeabl the ill-wil
which produc it wa necessarili increas emma dislik
her manner too--and mr elton were unpleas toward harriet
they were sneer and neglig emma hope it must rapidli work
harriet cure; but the sensat which could prompt such behaviour
sunk them both veri much--it wa not to be doubt that poor
harriet attach had been an offer to conjug unreserv
and her own share in the stori under a colour the least favour
to her and the most sooth to him had in all likelihood been
given also she wa of cours the object of their joint dislike--
when they had noth els to say it must be alway easi to begin
abus miss woodhouse; and the enmiti which they dare not shew
in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptu
treatment of harriet

mr elton took a great fanci to jane fairfax; and from the first
not mere when a state of warfar with one young ladi might be
suppos to recommend the other but from the veri first; and she
wa not satisfi with express a natur and reason admiration--
but without solicit or plea or privileg she must be want
to assist and befriend her--befor emma had forfeit her confid
and about the third time of their meet she heard all mr elton
knight-errantri on the subject--

jane fairfax is absolut charm miss woodhouse--i quit
rave about jane fairfax--a sweet interest creatur so mild
and ladylike--and with such talents!--i assur you i think she
ha veri extraordinari talent i do not scrupl to say that she
play extrem well i know enough of music to speak decidedli
on that point oh! she is absolut charming! you will laugh at
my warmth--but upon my word i talk of noth but jane fairfax--
and her situat is so calcul to affect one!--miss woodhous
we must exert ourselv and endeavour to do someth for her
we must bring her forward such talent as her must not be suffer
to remain unknown--i dare say you have heard those charm line of
the poet

`full mani a flower is born to blush unseen
`and wast it fragranc on the desert air

we must not allow them to be verifi in sweet jane fairfax

i cannot think there is ani danger of it wa emma calm answer--
and when you are better acquaint with miss fairfax situat
and understand what her home ha been with colonel and mr campbel
i have no idea that you will suppos her talent can be unknown

oh! but dear miss woodhous she is now in such retir
such obscur so thrown away--whatev advantag she may have
enjoy with the campbel are so palpabl at an end! and i think
she feel it i am sure she doe she is veri timid and silent
one can see that she feel the want of encourag i like her
the better for it i must confess it is a recommend to me
i am a great advoc for timidity--and i am sure one doe
not often meet with it--but in those who are at all inferior
it is extrem prepossess oh! i assur you jane fairfax
is a veri delight charact and interest me more than i
can express

you appear to feel a great deal--but i am not awar how you or ani
of miss fairfax acquaint here ani of those who have known
her longer than yourself can shew her ani other attent than--

my dear miss woodhous a vast deal may be done by those who dare
to act you and i need not be afraid if _we_ set the exampl
mani will follow it as far as they can; though all have not
our situat _we_ have carriag to fetch and convey her home
and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addit of
jane fairfax at ani time the least inconvenient--i should be
extrem displeas if wright were to send us up such a dinner
as could make me regret have ask _more_ than jane fairfax
to partak of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is
not like that i _should_ consid what i have been use to
my greatest danger perhap in housekeep may be quit the
other way in do too much and be too careless of expens
mapl grove will probabl be my model more than it ought to be--
for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckl
in income--howev my resolut is taken as to notic jane fairfax--
i shall certainli have her veri often at my hous shall introduc
her wherev i can shall have music parti to draw out her talent
and shall be constantli on the watch for an elig situat
my acquaint is so veri extens that i have littl doubt
of hear of someth to suit her shortly--i shall introduc her
of cours veri particularli to my brother and sister when they come
to us i am sure they will like her extremely; and when she get
a littl acquaint with them her fear will complet wear off
for there realli is noth in the manner of either but what is
highli conciliating--i shall have her veri often inde while they
are with me and i dare say we shall sometim find a seat for her in
the barouche-landau in some of our explor parti

poor jane fairfax!--thought emma--y have not deserv thi
you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but thi is a
punish beyond what you can have merited!--th kind and protect
of mr elton!--`jan fairfax and jane fairfax heavens! let me
not suppos that she dare go about emma woodhouse- me!--
but upon my honour there seem no limit to the licenti
of that woman tongue!

emma had not to listen to such parad again--to ani so exclus
address to herself--so disgustingli decor with a dear miss
woodhous the chang on mr elton side soon afterward appear
and she wa left in peace--neith forc to be the veri particular
friend of mr elton nor under mr elton guidanc the veri
activ patro of jane fairfax and onli share with other in a
gener way in know what wa felt what wa medit what wa done

she look on with some amusement--miss batess gratitud for
mr elton attent to jane wa in the first style of guileless
simplic and warmth she wa quit one of her worthies--
the most amiabl affabl delight woman--just as accomplish
and condescend as mr elton meant to be consid
emma onli surpriz wa that jane fairfax should accept
those attent and toler mr elton as she seem to do
she heard of her walk with the elton sit with the elton
spend a day with the eltons! thi wa astonishing!--sh could not
have believ it possibl that the tast or the pride of miss fairfax
could endur such societi and friendship as the vicarag had to offer

she is a riddl quit a riddle! said she--to chuse to remain
here month after month under privat of everi sort! and now
to chuse the mortif of mr elton notic and the penuri
of her convers rather than return to the superior companion
who have alway love her with such real gener affect

jane had come to highburi professedli for three months; the campbel
were gone to ireland for three months; but now the campbel
had promis their daughter to stay at least till midsumm
and fresh invit had arriv for her to join them there
accord to miss bates--it all came from her--mr dixon had
written most pressingli would jane but go mean were to be found
servant sent friend contrived--no travel difficulti allow
to exist; but still she had declin it!

she must have some motiv more power than appear for refus
thi invit wa emma conclus she must be under some
sort of penanc inflict either by the campbel or herself
there is great fear great caution great resolut somewhere--
she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ the decre is issu by somebodi
but whi must she consent to be with the eltons?--her is quit a
separ puzzl

upon her speak her wonder aloud on that part of the subject
befor the few who knew her opinion of mr elton mr weston
ventur thi apolog for jane

we cannot suppos that she ha ani great enjoy at the vicarag
my dear emma--but it is better than be alway at home
her aunt is a good creatur but as a constant companion
must be veri tiresom we must consid what miss fairfax quit
befor we condemn her tast for what she goe to

you are right mr weston said mr knightley warmli miss fairfax
is as capabl as ani of us of form a just opinion of mr elton
could she have chosen with whom to associ she would not have
chosen her but (with a reproach smile at emma) she receiv
attent from mr elton which nobodi els pay her

emma felt that mr weston wa give her a momentari glance;
and she wa herself struck by hi warmth with a faint blush
she present repli

such attent as mr elton i should have imagin
would rather disgust than gratifi miss fairfax mr elton
invit i should have imagin ani thing but invit

i should not wonder said mr weston if miss fairfax were to have
been drawn on beyond her own inclin by her aunt eager
in accept mr elton civil for her poor miss bate may
veri like have commit her niec and hurri her into a greater
appear of intimaci than her own good sens would have dictat
in spite of the veri natur wish of a littl chang

both felt rather anxiou to hear him speak again; and after a few
minut silenc he said

anoth thing must be taken into consider too--mr elton
doe not talk _to_ miss fairfax as she speak _of_ her we all know
the differ between the pronoun he or she and thou the plainest
spoken amongst us; we all feel the influenc of a someth beyond
common civil in our person intercours with each other--
a someth more earli implant we cannot give ani bodi the
disagre hint that we may have been veri full of the hour befor
we feel thing differ and besid the oper of thi
as a gener principl you may be sure that miss fairfax awe
mr elton by her superior both of mind and manner; and that
face to face mr elton treat her with all the respect which she
ha a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probabl never fell
in mr elton way before--and no degre of vaniti can prevent
her acknowledg her own compar littl in action if not
in conscious

i know how highli you think of jane fairfax said emma
littl henri wa in her thought and a mixtur of alarm and delicaci
made her irresolut what els to say

ye he repli ani bodi may know how highli i think of her

and yet said emma begin hastili and with an arch look
but soon stopping--it wa better howev to know the worst at once--
she hurri on--and yet perhap you may hardli be awar yourself
how highli it is the extent of your admir may take you by
surpriz some day or other

mr knightley wa hard at work upon the lower button of hi thick
leather gaiter and either the exert of get them togeth
or some other caus brought the colour into hi face as he answer

oh! are you there?--but you are miser behindhand mr cole
gave me a hint of it six week ago

he stopped--emma felt her foot press by mr weston and did
not herself know what to think in a moment he went on--

that will never be howev i can assur you miss fairfax
i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her--and i am veri
sure i shall never ask her

emma return her friend pressur with interest; and wa pleas
enough to exclaim

you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you

he seem hardli to hear her; he wa thoughtful--and in a manner
which shew him not pleas soon afterward said

so you have been settl that i should marri jane fairfax?

no inde i have not you have scold me too much for match-mak
for me to presum to take such a liberti with you what i said
just now meant noth one say those sort of thing of cours
without ani idea of a seriou mean oh! no upon my word i have not
the smallest wish for your marri jane fairfax or jane ani bodi
you would not come in and sit with us in thi comfort way
if you were marri

mr knightley wa thought again the result of hi reveri wa
no emma i do not think the extent of my admir for her will
ever take me by surprize--i never had a thought of her in that way
i assur you and soon afterward jane fairfax is a veri charm
young woman--but not even jane fairfax is perfect she ha a fault
she ha not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife

emma could not but rejoic to hear that she had a fault
well said she and you soon silenc mr cole i suppose?

ye veri soon he gave me a quiet hint; i told him he wa mistaken;
he ask my pardon and said no more cole doe not want to be wiser
or wittier than hi neighbour

in that respect how unlik dear mr elton who want to be wiser
and wittier than all the world! i wonder how she speak of the coles--
what she call them! how can she find ani appel for them
deep enough in familiar vulgarity? she call you knightley--what can
she do for mr cole? and so i am not to be surpriz that jane
fairfax accept her civil and consent to be with her
mr weston your argument weigh most with me i can much more
readili enter into the temptat of get away from miss bate
than i can believ in the triumph of miss fairfax mind over
mr elton i have no faith in mr elton acknowledg herself
the inferior in thought word or deed; or in her be under ani
restraint beyond her own scanti rule of good-breed i cannot
imagin that she will not be continu insult her visitor
with prais encourag and offer of service; that she will not be
continu detail her magnific intent from the procur
her a perman situat to the includ her in those delight
explor parti which are to take place in the barouche-landau

jane fairfax ha feel said mr knightley--i do not
accus her of want of feel her sensibl i suspect
are strong--and her temper excel in it power of forbear
patienc self-controul; but it want open she is reserv
more reserv i think than she use to be--and i love an
open temper no--til cole allud to my suppos attach
it had never enter my head i saw jane fairfax and convers with
her with admir and pleasur always--but with no thought beyond

well mr weston said emma triumphantli when he left them
what do you say now to mr knightley marri jane fairfax?

whi realli dear emma i say that he is so veri much occupi
by the idea of _not_ be in love with her that i should not wonder
if it were to end in hi be so at last do not beat me



chapter xvi


everi bodi in and about highburi who had ever visit mr elton
wa dispos to pay him attent on hi marriag dinner-parti and
evening-parti were made for him and hi lady; and invit
flow in so fast that she had soon the pleasur of apprehend
they were never to have a disengag day

i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead
among you upon my word we shall be absolut dissip
we realli seem quit the fashion if thi is live in the countri
it is noth veri formid from monday next to saturday
i assur you we have not a disengag day!--a woman with fewer
resourc than i have need not have been at a loss

no invit came amiss to her her bath habit made evening-parti
perfectli natur to her and mapl grove had given her a tast
for dinner she wa a littl shock at the want of two
draw room at the poor attempt at rout-cak and there be
no ice in the highburi card-parti mr bate mr perri
mr goddard and other were a good deal behind-hand in knowledg
of the world but she would soon shew them how everi thing ought
to be arrang in the cours of the spring she must return their
civil by one veri superior party--in which her card-tabl
should be set out with their separ candl and unbroken pack
in the true style--and more waiter engag for the even
than their own establish could furnish to carri round
the refresh at exactli the proper hour and in the proper order

emma in the meanwhil could not be satisfi without a dinner
at hartfield for the elton they must not do less than other
or she should be expos to odiou suspicion and imagin capabl
of piti resent a dinner there must be after emma had
talk about it for ten minut mr woodhous felt no unwilling
and onli made the usual stipul of not sit at the bottom
of the tabl himself with the usual regular difficulti of decid
who should do it for him

the person to be invit requir littl thought besid the elton
it must be the weston and mr knightley; so far it wa all of course--
and it wa hardli less inevit that poor littl harriet must
be ask to make the eighth:--but thi invit wa not given
with equal satisfact and on mani account emma wa particularli
pleas by harriet beg to be allow to declin it
she would rather not be in hi compani more than she could help
she wa not yet quit abl to see him and hi charm happi
wife togeth without feel uncomfort if miss woodhous
would not be displeas she would rather stay at home
it wa precis what emma would have wish had she deem it
possibl enough for wish she wa delight with the fortitud
of her littl friend--for fortitud she knew it wa in her to give
up be in compani and stay at home; and she could now invit the
veri person whom she realli want to make the eighth jane fairfax--
sinc her last convers with mr weston and mr knightley
she wa more conscience-stricken about jane fairfax than she had
often been--mr knightley word dwelt with her he had said
that jane fairfax receiv attent from mr elton which nobodi
els paid her

thi is veri true said she at least as far as relat to me
which wa all that wa meant--and it is veri shameful--of the same age--
and alway know her--i ought to have been more her friend--
she will never like me now i have neglect her too long but i
will shew her greater attent than i have done

everi invit wa success they were all disengag and all happy--
the preparatori interest of thi dinner howev wa not yet over
a circumst rather unlucki occur the two eldest littl
knightley were engag to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of
some week in the spring and their papa now propos bring them
and stay one whole day at hartfield--which one day would be
the veri day of thi party--hi profession engag did
not allow of hi be put off but both father and daughter were
disturb by it happen so mr woodhous consid eight
person at dinner togeth as the utmost that hi nerv could bear--
and here would be a ninth--and emma apprehend that it would
be a ninth veri much out of humour at not be abl to come even
to hartfield for forty-eight hour without fall in with a dinner-parti

she comfort her father better than she could comfort herself
by repres that though he certainli would make them nine
yet he alway said so littl that the increas of nois would be
veri immateri she thought it in realiti a sad exchang for herself
to have him with hi grave look and reluct convers oppos
to her instead of hi brother

the event wa more favour to mr woodhous than to emma
john knightley came; but mr weston wa unexpectedli summon to town
and must be absent on the veri day he might be abl to join them
in the even but certainli not to dinner mr woodhous wa quit
at ease; and the see him so with the arriv of the littl boy
and the philosoph composur of her brother on hear hi fate
remov the chief of even emma vexat

the day came the parti were punctual assembl and mr john knightley
seem earli to devot himself to the busi of be agreeabl
instead of draw hi brother off to a window while they wait
for dinner he wa talk to miss fairfax mr elton as eleg
as lace and pearl could make her he look at in silence--
want onli to observ enough for isabella information--but miss
fairfax wa an old acquaint and a quiet girl and he could
talk to her he had met her befor breakfast as he wa return
from a walk with hi littl boy when it had been just begin
to rain it wa natur to have some civil hope on the subject
and he said

i hope you did not ventur far miss fairfax thi morn or i
am sure you must have been wet--w scarc got home in time
i hope you turn directli

i went onli to the post-offic said she and reach home
befor the rain wa much it is my daili errand i alway fetch
the letter when i am here it save troubl and is a someth
to get me out a walk befor breakfast doe me good

not a walk in the rain i should imagin

no but it did not absolut rain when i set out

mr john knightley smile and repli

that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six
yard from your own door when i had the pleasur of meet you;
and henri and john had seen more drop than they could count long befor
the post-offic ha a great charm at one period of our live
when you have live to my age you will begin to think letter are
never worth go through the rain for

there wa a littl blush and then thi answer

i must not hope to be ever situat as you are in the midst of
everi dearest connexion and therefor i cannot expect that simpli
grow older should make me indiffer about letter

indifferent! oh! no--i never conceiv you could becom indiffer
letter are no matter of indifference; they are gener a veri
posit curs

you are speak of letter of business; mine are letter
of friendship

i have often thought them the worst of the two repli he coolli
busi you know may bring money but friendship hardli
ever doe

ah! you are not seriou now i know mr john knightley too well--
i am veri sure he understand the valu of friendship as well as
ani bodi i can easili believ that letter are veri littl to you
much less than to me but it is not your be ten year older than
myself which make the differ it is not age but situat
you have everi bodi dearest to you alway at hand i probabl
never shall again; and therefor till i have outliv all my affect
a post-offic i think must alway have power to draw me out
in wors weather than to-day

when i talk of your be alter by time by the progress of year
said john knightley i meant to impli the chang of situat
which time usual bring i consid one as includ the other
time will gener lessen the interest of everi attach not within
the daili circle--but that is not the chang i had in view for you
as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten
year henc you may have as mani concentr object as i have

it wa kindli said and veri far from give offenc a pleasant
thank you seem meant to laugh it off but a blush a quiver lip
a tear in the eye shew that it wa felt beyond a laugh
her attent wa now claim by mr woodhous who be
accord to hi custom on such occas make the circl of
hi guest and pay hi particular compliment to the ladi
wa end with her--and with all hi mildest urban said

i am veri sorri to hear miss fairfax of your be out thi
morn in the rain young ladi should take care of themselves--
young ladi are delic plant they should take care of their
health and their complexion my dear did you chang your stockings?

ye sir i did indeed; and i am veri much oblig by your kind
solicitud about me

my dear miss fairfax young ladi are veri sure to be care for--
i hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well they are some
of my veri old friend i wish my health allow me to be a
better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to-day i am sure
my daughter and i are both highli sensibl of your good
and have the greatest satisfact in see you at hartfield

the kind-heart polit old man might then sit down and feel
that he had done hi duti and made everi fair ladi welcom and easi

by thi time the walk in the rain had reach mr elton
and her remonstr now open upon jane

my dear jane what is thi i hear?--go to the post-offic
in the rain!--thi must not be i assur you--you sad girl
how could you do such a thing?--it is a sign i wa not there
to take care of you

jane veri patient assur her that she had not caught ani cold

oh! do not tell _me_ you realli are a veri sad girl and do not
know how to take care of yourself--to the post-offic indeed!
mr weston did you ever hear the like? you and i must posit
exert our author

my advic said mr weston kindli and persuas i certainli
do feel tempt to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks--
liabl as you have been to sever cold inde you ought
to be particularli care especi at thi time of year
the spring i alway think requir more than common care
better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letter
than run the risk of bring on your cough again now do not you
feel that you had? ye i am sure you are much too reason
you look as if you would not do such a thing again

oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again eagerli rejoin
mr elton we will not allow her to do such a thing again:--
and nod significantly--ther must be some arrang made
there must inde i shall speak to mr e the man who fetch
our letter everi morn (one of our men i forget hi name)
shall inquir for your too and bring them to you that will obviat
all difficulti you know; and from _us_ i realli think my dear jane
you can have no scrupl to accept such an accommod

you are extrem kind said jane; but i cannot give up my
earli walk i am advis to be out of door as much as i can
i must walk somewher and the post-offic is an object; and upon
my word i have scarc ever had a bad morn befor

my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determin
that is (laugh affectedly) as far as i can presum to determin
ani thing without the concurr of my lord and master you know
mr weston you and i must be cautiou how we express ourselv
but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influenc is not entir
worn out if i meet with no insuper difficulti therefor
consid that point as settl

excus me said jane earnestli i cannot by ani mean consent
to such an arrang so needlessli troublesom to your servant
if the errand were not a pleasur to me it could be done as it
alway is when i am not here by my grandmama

oh! my dear; but so much as patti ha to do!--and it is a kind
to employ our men

jane look as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead
of answer she began speak again to mr john knightley

the post-offic is a wonder establishment! said she--
the regular and despatch of it! if one think of all that it
ha to do and all that it doe so well it is realli astonishing!

it is certainli veri well regul

so seldom that ani neglig or blunder appears! so seldom
that a letter among the thousand that are constantli pass
about the kingdom is even carri wrong--and not one in a million
i suppos actual lost! and when one consid the varieti
of hand and of bad hand too that are to be deciph
it increas the wonder

the clerk grow expert from habit--they must begin with some
quick of sight and hand and exercis improv them if you
want ani farther explan continu he smile they are
paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capac
the public pay and must be serv well

the varieti of handwrit were farther talk of and the usual
observ made

i have heard it assert said john knightley that the same
sort of handwrit often prevail in a family; and where the
same master teach it is natur enough but for that reason
i should imagin the like must be chiefli confin to the femal
for boy have veri littl teach after an earli age and scrambl
into ani hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write
veri much alik i have not alway known their write apart

ye said hi brother hesitatingli there is a like
i know what you mean--but emma hand is the strongest

isabella and emma both write beauti said mr woodhouse;
and alway did and so doe poor mr weston--with half a sigh
and half a smile at her

i never saw ani gentleman handwriting--emma began look also
at mr weston; but stop on perceiv that mr weston wa
attend to some one else--and the paus gave her time to reflect
now how am i go to introduc him?--am i unequ to speak
hi name at onc befor all these people? is it necessari
for me to use ani roundabout phrase?--your yorkshir friend--
your correspond in yorkshire;--that would be the way i suppos
if i were veri bad--no i can pronounc hi name without the
smallest distress i certainli get better and better--now for it

mr weston wa disengag and emma began again--mr frank churchil
write one of the best gentleman hand i ever saw

i do not admir it said mr knightley it is too small--
want strength it is like a woman write

thi wa not submit to by either ladi they vindic him
against the base aspers no it by no mean want strength--
it wa not a larg hand but veri clear and certainli strong
had not mr weston ani letter about her to produce? no she had
heard from him veri late but have answer the letter had put
it away

if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing-desk
i am sure i could produc a specimen i have a note of his--
do not you rememb mr weston employ him to write for you
one day?

he chose to say he wa employed--

well well i have that note; and can shew it after dinner
to convinc mr knightley

oh! when a gallant young man like mr frank churchil
said mr knightley dryli write to a fair ladi like miss woodhous
he will of cours put forth hi best

dinner wa on table--mr elton befor she could be spoken to
wa ready; and befor mr woodhous had reach her with hi request
to be allow to hand her into the dining-parlour wa saying--

must i go first? i realli am asham of alway lead the way

jane solicitud about fetch her own letter had not escap emma
she had heard and seen it all; and felt some curios to know
whether the wet walk of thi morn had produc ani she suspect
that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolut encount
but in full expect of hear from some one veri dear
and that it had not been in vain she thought there wa an air
of greater happi than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirit

she could have made an inquiri or two as to the expedit
and the expens of the irish mails;--it wa at her tongu end--
but she abstain she wa quit determin not to utter a word
that should hurt jane fairfax feelings; and they follow
the other ladi out of the room arm in arm with an appear
of good-wil highli becom to the beauti and grace of each



chapter xvii


when the ladi return to the drawing-room after dinner emma found
it hardli possibl to prevent their make two distinct parties;--
with so much persever in judg and behav ill did mr elton
engross jane fairfax and slight herself she and mr weston were
oblig to be almost alway either talk togeth or silent togeth
mr elton left them no choic if jane repress her for a
littl time she soon began again; and though much that pass
between them wa in a half-whisp especi on mr elton side
there wa no avoid a knowledg of their princip subjects:
the post-office--catch cold--fetch letters--and friendship
were long under discussion; and to them succeed one which must
be at least equal unpleas to jane--inquiri whether she had
yet heard of ani situat like to suit her and profess of
mr elton medit activ

here is april come! said she i get quit anxiou about you
june will soon be here

but i have never fix on june or ani other month--mer look
forward to the summer in gener

but have you realli heard of nothing?

i have not even made ani inquiry; i do not wish to make ani yet

oh! my dear we cannot begin too early; you are not awar
of the difficulti of procur exactli the desir thing

i not aware! said jane shake her head; dear mr elton
who can have thought of it as i have done?

but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not
know how mani candid there alway are for the _first_ situat
i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round mapl grove
a cousin of mr suckl mr bragg had such an infin
of applications; everi bodi wa anxiou to be in her famili
for she move in the first circl wax-candl in the schoolroom!
you may imagin how desirable! of all hous in the kingdom
mr bragg is the one i would most wish to see you in

colonel and mr campbel are to be in town again by midsumm
said jane i must spend some time with them; i am sure they will
want it;--afterward i may probabl be glad to dispos of myself
but i would not wish you to take the troubl of make ani inquiri
at present

trouble! aye i know your scrupl you are afraid of give
me trouble; but i assur you my dear jane the campbel can
hardli be more interest about you than i am i shall write
to mr partridg in a day or two and shall give her a strict
charg to be on the look-out for ani thing elig

thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject
to her; till the time draw nearer i do not wish to be give
ani bodi troubl

but my dear child the time is draw near; here is april
and june or say even juli is veri near with such busi
to accomplish befor us your inexperi realli amus me!
a situat such as you deserv and your friend would requir for you
is no everyday occurr is not obtain at a moment notice;
inde inde we must begin inquir directli

excus me maam but thi is by no mean my intention; i make no
inquiri myself and should be sorri to have ani made by my friend
when i am quit determin as to the time i am not at all afraid
of be long unemploy there are place in town offic
where inquiri would soon produc something--offic for the sale--
not quit of human flesh--but of human intellect

oh! my dear human flesh! you quit shock me; if you mean a fling
at the slave-trad i assur you mr suckl wa alway rather
a friend to the abolit

i did not mean i wa not think of the slave-trad repli jane;
governess-trad i assur you wa all that i had in view;
wide differ certainli as to the guilt of those who carri it on;
but as to the greater miseri of the victim i do not know where
it lie but i onli mean to say that there are advertis offic
and that by appli to them i should have no doubt of veri soon
meet with someth that would do

someth that would do! repeat mr elton aye _that_ may
suit your humbl idea of yourself;--i know what a modest creatur
you are; but it will not satisfi your friend to have you take up
with ani thing that may offer ani inferior commonplac situat
in a famili not move in a certain circl or abl to command
the eleg of life

you are veri obliging; but as to all that i am veri indifferent;
it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortif
i think would onli be the greater; i should suffer more from comparison
a gentleman famili is all that i should condit for

i know you i know you; you would take up with ani thing; but i
shall be a littl more nice and i am sure the good campbel will
be quit on my side; with your superior talent you have a right
to move in the first circl your music knowledg alon would
entitl you to name your own term have as mani room as you like
and mix in the famili as much as you chose;--that is--i do not know--
if you knew the harp you might do all that i am veri sure;
but you sing as well as play;--y i realli believ you might
even without the harp stipul for what you chose;--and you must
and shall be delight honour and comfort settl befor
the campbel or i have ani rest

you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort
of such a situat togeth said jane they are pretti sure
to be equal; howev i am veri seriou in not wish ani thing
to be attempt at present for me i am exceedingli oblig to you
mr elton i am oblig to ani bodi who feel for me but i am
quit seriou in wish noth to be done till the summer
for two or three month longer i shall remain where i am and as
i am

and i am quit seriou too i assur you repli mr elton gaili
in resolv to be alway on the watch and employ my friend
to watch also that noth realli unexception may pass us

in thi style she ran on; never thoroughli stop by ani thing
till mr woodhous came into the room; her vaniti had then a chang
of object and emma heard her say in the same half-whisp to jane

here come thi dear old beau of mine i protest!--onli think of hi
gallantri in come away befor the other men!--what a dear creatur
he is;--i assur you i like him excess i admir all that quaint
old-fashion politeness; it is much more to my tast than modern ease;
modern eas often disgust me but thi good old mr woodhous
i wish you had heard hi gallant speech to me at dinner oh! i assur
you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolut jealou
i fanci i am rather a favourite; he took notic of my gown
how do you like it?--selina choice--handsom i think but i
do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; i have the greatest
dislik to the idea of be over-trimmed--quit a horror of fineri
i must put on a few ornament now becaus it is expect of me
a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natur tast
is all for simplicity; a simpl style of dress is so infinit
prefer to fineri but i am quit in the minor i believe;
few peopl seem to valu simplic of dress--show and fineri
are everi thing i have some notion of put such a trim
as thi to my white and silver poplin do you think it will
look well?

the whole parti were but just reassembl in the drawing-room
when mr weston made hi appear among them he had return
to a late dinner and walk to hartfield as soon as it wa over
he had been too much expect by the best judg for surprize--
but there wa great joy mr woodhous wa almost as glad to see
him now as he would have been sorri to see him befor john knightley
onli wa in mute astonishment--that a man who might have spent
hi even quietli at home after a day of busi in london
should set off again and walk half a mile to anoth man hous
for the sake of be in mix compani till bed-tim of finish
hi day in the effort of civil and the nois of number
wa a circumst to strike him deepli a man who had been in motion
sinc eight oclock in the morn and might now have been still
who had been long talk and might have been silent who had been
in more than one crowd and might have been alone!--such a man
to quit the tranquil and independ of hi own firesid
and on the even of a cold sleeti april day rush out again into
the world!--could he by a touch of hi finger have instantli taken
back hi wife there would have been a motive; but hi come would
probabl prolong rather than break up the parti john knightley
look at him with amaz then shrug hi shoulder and said
i could not have believ it even of _him_

mr weston meanwhil perfectli unsuspici of the indign
he wa excit happi and cheer as usual and with all
the right of be princip talker which a day spent anywher
from home confer wa make himself agreeabl among the rest;
and have satisfi the inquiri of hi wife as to hi dinner
convinc her that none of all her care direct to the servant
had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard
wa proceed to a famili commun which though princip
address to mr weston he had not the smallest doubt of be
highli interest to everi bodi in the room he gave her a letter
it wa from frank and to herself; he had met with it in hi way
and had taken the liberti of open it

read it read it said he it will give you pleasure;
onli a few lines--wil not take you long; read it to emma

the two ladi look over it together; and he sat smile
and talk to them the whole time in a voic a littl subdu
but veri audibl to everi bodi

well he is come you see; good news i think well what do
you say to it?--i alway told you he would be here again soon
did not i?--ann my dear did not i alway tell you so and you would
not believ me?--in town next week you see--at the latest i dare say;
for _she_ is as impati as the black gentleman when ani thing is
to be done; most like they will be there to-morrow or saturday
as to her ill all noth of cours but it is an excel
thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay
a good while when they do come and he will be half hi time with us
thi is precis what i want well pretti good news is not it?
have you finish it? ha emma read it all? put it up put it up;
we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not
do now i shall onli just mention the circumst to the other in a
common way

mr weston wa most comfort pleas on the occas
her look and word had noth to restrain them she wa happi
she knew she wa happi and knew she ought to be happi
her congratul were warm and open; but emma could not speak
so fluentli _she_ wa a littl occupi in weigh her own feel
and tri to understand the degre of her agit which she
rather thought wa consider

mr weston howev too eager to be veri observ too commun
to want other to talk wa veri well satisfi with what she did say
and soon move away to make the rest of hi friend happi by a partial
commun of what the whole room must have overheard alreadi

it wa well that he took everi bodi joy for grant or he
might not have thought either mr woodhous or mr knightley
particularli delight they were the first entitl
after mr weston and emma to be made happy;--from them he would
have proceed to miss fairfax but she wa so deep in convers
with john knightley that it would have been too posit
an interruption; and find himself close to mr elton and
her attent disengag he necessarili began on the subject with her



chapter xviii


i hope i shall soon have the pleasur of introduc my son to you
said mr weston

mr elton veri will to suppos a particular compliment intend
her by such a hope smile most gracious

you have heard of a certain frank churchil i presum he continued--
and know him to be my son though he doe not bear my name

oh! ye and i shall be veri happi in hi acquaint
i am sure mr elton will lose no time in call on him; and we
shall both have great pleasur in see him at the vicarag

you are veri obliging--frank will be extrem happi i am sure--
he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notic of it
in a letter to-day i met the letter in my way thi morn
and see my son hand presum to open it--though it wa not direct
to me--it wa to mr weston she is hi princip correspond
i assur you i hardli ever get a letter

and so you absolut open what wa direct to her! oh! mr weston--
(laugh affectedly) i must protest against that--a most danger
preced indeed!--i beg you will not let your neighbour follow
your example--upon my word if thi is what i am to expect
we marri women must begin to exert ourselves!--oh! mr weston
i could not have believ it of you!

aye we men are sad fellow you must take care of yourself
mr elton--thi letter tell us--it is a short letter--written in
a hurri mere to give us notice--it tell us that they are all
come up to town directli on mr churchil account--sh ha
not been well the whole winter and think enscomb too cold for her--
so they are all to move southward without loss of time

indeed!--from yorkshir i think enscomb is in yorkshire?

ye they are about one hundr and nineti mile from london
a consider journey

ye upon my word veri consider sixty-f mile farther
than from mapl grove to london but what is distanc mr weston
to peopl of larg fortune?--y would be amaz to hear how my brother
mr suckl sometim fli about you will hardli believ me--
but twice in one week he and mr bragg went to london and back again
with four hors

the evil of the distanc from enscomb said mr weston is that
mr churchil _as_ _we_ _understand_ ha not been abl to leav the
sofa for a week togeth in frank last letter she complain
he said of be too weak to get into her conservatori without have
both hi arm and hi uncles! thi you know speak a great degre
of weakness--but now she is so impati to be in town that she
mean to sleep onli two night on the road--so frank write word
certainli delic ladi have veri extraordinari constitut
mr elton you must grant me that

no inde i shall grant you noth i alway take the part
of my own sex i do inde i give you notice--y will find me
a formid antagonist on that point i alway stand up for women--
and i assur you if you knew how selina feel with respect
to sleep at an inn you would not wonder at mr churchil
make incred exert to avoid it selina say it is quit
horror to her--and i believ i have caught a littl of her niceti
she alway travel with her own sheets; an excel precaut
doe mr churchil do the same?

depend upon it mr churchil doe everi thing that ani other
fine ladi ever did mr churchil will not be second to ani ladi
in the land for--

mr elton eagerli interpos with

oh! mr weston do not mistak me selina is no fine ladi
i assur you do not run away with such an idea

is not she? then she is no rule for mr churchil who is
as thorough a fine ladi as ani bodi ever beheld

mr elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaim so warmli
it wa by no mean her object to have it believ that her sister
wa _not_ a fine lady; perhap there wa want of spirit in the pretenc
of it;--and she wa consid in what way she had best retract
when mr weston went on

mr churchil is not much in my good grace as you may suspect--
but thi is quit between ourselv she is veri fond of frank
and therefor i would not speak ill of her besid she is out of
health now; but _that_ inde by her own account she ha alway been
i would not say so to everi bodi mr elton but i have not much
faith in mr churchil ill

if she is realli ill whi not go to bath mr weston?--to bath
or to clifton? she ha taken it into her head that enscomb is too
cold for her the fact is i suppos that she is tire of enscomb
she ha now been a longer time stationari there than she ever
wa befor and she begin to want chang it is a retir place
a fine place but veri retir

aye--lik mapl grove i dare say noth can stand more retir from
the road than mapl grove such an immens plantat all round it!
you seem shut out from everi thing--in the most complet retirement--
and mr churchil probabl ha not health or spirit like selina
to enjoy that sort of seclus or perhap she may not have
resourc enough in herself to be qualifi for a countri life
i alway say a woman cannot have too mani resources--and i feel
veri thank that i have so mani myself as to be quit independ
of societi

frank wa here in februari for a fortnight

so i rememb to have heard he will find an _addition_ to the
societi of highburi when he come again; that is if i may presum
to call myself an addit but perhap he may never have heard
of there be such a creatur in the world

thi wa too loud a call for a compliment to be pass by
and mr weston with a veri good grace immedi exclaim

my dear madam! nobodi but yourself could imagin such a
thing possibl not heard of you!--i believ mr weston
letter late have been full of veri littl els than mr elton

he had done hi duti and could return to hi son

when frank left us continu he it wa quit uncertain when we
might see him again which make thi day news doubli welcom
it ha been complet unexpect that is _i_ alway had a strong
persuas he would be here again soon i wa sure someth
favour would turn up--but nobodi believ me he and mr weston
were both dread despond `how could he contriv to come?
and how could it be suppos that hi uncl and aunt would spare
him again? and so forth--i alway felt that someth would happen
in our favour; and so it ha you see i have observ mr elton
in the cours of my life that if thing are go untowardli one month
they are sure to mend the next

veri true mr weston perfectli true it is just what i use
to say to a certain gentleman in compani in the day of courtship
when becaus thing did not go quit right did not proceed with all
the rapid which suit hi feel he wa apt to be in despair
and exclaim that he wa sure at thi rate it would be _may_ befor
hymen saffron robe would be put on for us oh! the pain i have
been at to dispel those gloomi idea and give him cheerful views!
the carriage--w had disappoint about the carriage;--on morn
i rememb he came to me quit in despair

she wa stop by a slight fit of cough and mr weston instantli
seiz the opportun of go on

you were mention may may is the veri month which mr churchil
is order or ha order herself to spend in some warmer place
than enscombe--in short to spend in london; so that we have the
agreeabl prospect of frequent visit from frank the whole spring--
precis the season of the year which one should have chosen
for it: day almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant
alway invit one out and never too hot for exercis when he
wa here befor we made the best of it; but there wa a good deal
of wet damp cheerless weather; there alway is in februari you know
and we could not do half that we intend now will be the time
thi will be complet enjoyment; and i do not know mr elton
whether the uncertainti of our meet the sort of constant
expect there will be of hi come in to-day or to-morrow
and at ani hour may not be more friendli to happi than have
him actual in the hous i think it is so i think it is the
state of mind which give most spirit and delight i hope you
will be pleas with my son; but you must not expect a prodigi
he is gener thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigi
mr weston partial for him is veri great and as you may suppos
most gratifi to me she think nobodi equal to him

and i assur you mr weston i have veri littl doubt that my
opinion will be decidedli in hi favour i have heard so much
in prais of mr frank churchill--at the same time it is fair
to observ that i am one of those who alway judg for themselv
and are by no mean implicitli guid by other i give you notic
that as i find your son so i shall judg of him--i am no flatter

mr weston wa muse

i hope said he present i have not been sever upon poor
mr churchil if she is ill i should be sorri to do her injustice;
but there are some trait in her charact which make it difficult
for me to speak of her with the forbear i could wish
you cannot be ignor mr elton of my connexion with the famili
nor of the treatment i have met with; and between ourselv
the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she wa the instig
frank mother would never have been slight as she wa but for her
mr churchil ha pride; but hi pride is noth to hi wifes:
hi is a quiet indol gentlemanlik sort of pride that would
harm nobodi and onli make himself a littl helpless and tiresome;
but her pride is arrog and insolence! and what inclin one less
to bear she ha no fair pretenc of famili or blood she wa nobodi
when he marri her bare the daughter of a gentleman; but ever
sinc her be turn into a churchil she ha out-churchilld them
all in high and mighti claims: but in herself i assur you she is
an upstart

onli think! well that must be infinit provoking! i have quit
a horror of upstart mapl grove ha given me a thorough disgust
to peopl of that sort; for there is a famili in that neighbourhood
who are such an annoy to my brother and sister from the air
they give themselves! your descript of mr churchil made me
think of them directli peopl of the name of tupman veri late
settl there and encumb with mani low connexion but give
themselv immens air and expect to be on a foot with the old
establish famili a year and a half is the veri utmost that they can
have live at west hall; and how they got their fortun nobodi know
they came from birmingham which is not a place to promis much
you know mr weston one ha not great hope from birmingham
i alway say there is someth dire in the sound: but noth
more is posit known of the tupman though a good mani thing
i assur you are suspected; and yet by their manner they evid
think themselv equal even to my brother mr suckl who happen
to be one of their nearest neighbour it is infinit too bad
mr suckl who ha been eleven year a resid at mapl grove
and whose father had it befor him--i believ at least--i am
almost sure that old mr suckl had complet the purchas befor
hi death

they were interrupt tea wa carri round and mr weston
have said all that he want soon took the opportun of
walk away

after tea mr and mr weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhous
to card the remain five were left to their own power
and emma doubt their get on veri well; for mr knightley seem
littl dispos for conversation; mr elton wa want notic
which nobodi had inclin to pay and she wa herself
in a worri of spirit which would have made her prefer be silent

mr john knightley prove more talk than hi brother
he wa to leav them earli the next day; and he soon began with--

well emma i do not believ i have ani thing more to say about
the boys; but you have your sister letter and everi thing is
down at full length there we may be sure my charg would be much
more concis than her and probabl not much in the same spirit;
all that i have to recommend be compris in do not spoil them
and do not physic them

i rather hope to satisfi you both said emma for i shall do all
in my power to make them happi which will be enough for isabella;
and happi must preclud fals indulg and physic

and if you find them troublesom you must send them home again

that is veri like you think so do not you?

i hope i am awar that they may be too noisi for your father--
or even may be some encumbr to you if your visit engag
continu to increas as much as they have done late

increase!

certainly; you must be sensibl that the last half-year ha made
a great differ in your way of life

difference! no inde i am not

there can be no doubt of your be much more engag with compani
than you use to be wit thi veri time here am i come
down for onli one day and you are engag with a dinner-party!--
when did it happen befor or ani thing like it? your neighbourhood
is increas and you mix more with it a littl while ago
everi letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;
dinner at mr cole or ball at the crown the differ
which randal randal alon make in your goings-on is veri great

ye said hi brother quickli it is randal that doe it all

veri well--and as randal i suppos is not like to have less
influenc than heretofor it strike me as a possibl thing emma
that henri and john may be sometim in the way and if they are
i onli beg you to send them home

no cri mr knightley that need not be the consequ
let them be sent to donwel i shall certainli be at leisur

upon my word exclaim emma you amus me! i should like to know
how mani of all my numer engag take place without your be
of the party; and whi i am to be suppos in danger of want leisur
to attend to the littl boy these amaz engag of mine--
what have they been? dine onc with the coles--and have a ball
talk of which never took place i can understand you--(nod at
mr john knightley)--your good fortun in meet with so mani of
your friend at onc here delight you too much to pass unnot
but you (turn to mr knightley) who know how veri veri seldom
i am ever two hour from hartfield whi you should forese such a
seri of dissip for me i cannot imagin and as to my dear
littl boy i must say that if aunt emma ha not time for them
i do not think they would fare much better with uncl knightley
who is absent from home about five hour where she is absent one--
and who when he is at home is either read to himself or settl
hi account

mr knightley seem to be tri not to smile; and succeed
without difficulti upon mr elton begin to talk to him




volum iii



chapter i


a veri littl quiet reflect wa enough to satisfi emma as to the
natur of her agit on hear thi news of frank churchil
she wa soon convinc that it wa not for herself she wa feel at
all apprehens or embarrassed; it wa for him her own attach
had realli subsid into a mere nothing; it wa not worth think of;--
but if he who had undoubtedli been alway so much the most in love
of the two were to be return with the same warmth of sentiment
which he had taken away it would be veri distress if a separ
of two month should not have cool him there were danger and evil
befor her:--caut for him and for herself would be necessari
she did not mean to have her own affect entangl again
and it would be incumb on her to avoid ani encourag of hi

she wish she might be abl to keep him from an absolut declar
that would be so veri pain a conclus of their present acquaintance!
and yet she could not help rather anticip someth decis
she felt as if the spring would not pass without bring a crisi
an event a someth to alter her present compos and tranquil state

it wa not veri long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen
befor she had the power of form some opinion of frank churchil
feel the enscomb famili were not in town quit so soon as had
been imagin but he wa at highburi veri soon afterward he rode
down for a coupl of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came
from randal immedi to hartfield she could then exercis all
her quick observ and speedili determin how he wa influenc
and how she must act they met with the utmost friendli
there could be no doubt of hi great pleasur in see her
but she had an almost instant doubt of hi care for her as he
had done of hi feel the same tender in the same degre
she watch him well it wa a clear thing he wa less in love than he
had been absenc with the convict probabl of her indiffer
had produc thi veri natur and veri desir effect

he wa in high spirits; as readi to talk and laugh as ever and seem
delight to speak of hi former visit and recur to old stories:
and he wa not without agit it wa not in hi calm that
she read hi compar differ he wa not calm; hi spirit
were evid fluttered; there wa restless about him
live as he wa it seem a liveli that did not satisfi himself;
but what decid her belief on the subject wa hi stay onli a
quarter of an hour and hurri away to make other call in highburi
he had seen a group of old acquaint in the street as he passed--
he had not stop he would not stop for more than a word--but he
had the vaniti to think they would be disappoint if he did not call
and much as he wish to stay longer at hartfield he must hurri off
she had no doubt as to hi be less in love--but neither hi
agit spirit nor hi hurri away seem like a perfect cure;
and she wa rather inclin to think it impli a dread of her
return power and a discreet resolut of not trust himself
with her long

thi wa the onli visit from frank churchil in the cours of ten day
he wa often hope intend to come--but wa alway prevent
hi aunt could not bear to have him leav her such wa hi own account
at randal if he were quit sincer if he realli tri to come
it wa to be infer that mr churchil remov to london had
been of no servic to the wil or nervou part of her disord
that she wa realli ill wa veri certain; he had declar himself
convinc of it at randal though much might be fanci he could
not doubt when he look back that she wa in a weaker state
of health than she had been half a year ago he did not believ it
to proceed from ani thing that care and medicin might not remov
or at least that she might not have mani year of exist befor her;
but he could not be prevail on by all hi father doubt to say
that her complaint were mere imaginari or that she wa as strong
as ever

it soon appear that london wa not the place for her she could
not endur it nois her nerv were under continu irrit
and suffering; and by the ten day end her nephew letter to
randal commun a chang of plan they were go to remov
immedi to richmond mr churchil had been recommend
to the medic skill of an emin person there and had otherwis
a fanci for the place a ready-furnish hous in a favourit
spot wa engag and much benefit expect from the chang

emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirit of thi arrang
and seem most fulli to appreci the bless of have two
month befor him of such near neighbourhood to mani dear friends--
for the hous wa taken for may and june she wa told that now
he wrote with the greatest confid of be often with them
almost as often as he could even wish

emma saw how mr weston understood these joyou prospect he wa
consid her as the sourc of all the happi they offer
she hope it wa not so two month must bring it to the proof

mr weston own happi wa indisput he wa quit delight
it wa the veri circumst he could have wish for now it would
be realli have frank in their neighbourhood what were nine mile
to a young man?--an hour ride he would be alway come over
the differ in that respect of richmond and london wa enough
to make the whole differ of see him alway and see
him never sixteen miles--nay eighteen--it must be full eighteen
to manchester-street--wa a seriou obstacl were he ever abl
to get away the day would be spent in come and return
there wa no comfort in have him in london; he might as well be
at enscombe; but richmond wa the veri distanc for easi intercours
better than nearer!

one good thing wa immedi brought to a certainti by thi removal--
the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten befor but it had
been soon acknowledg vain to attempt to fix a day now howev
it wa absolut to be; everi prepar wa resum and veri soon
after the churchil had remov to richmond a few line from frank
to say that hi aunt felt alreadi much better for the chang

chapter ii


no misfortun occur again to prevent the ball the day approach
the day arrived; and after a morn of some anxiou watch
frank churchil in all the certainti of hi own self reach randal
befor dinner and everi thing wa safe

no second meet had there yet been between him and emma
the room at the crown wa to wit it;--but it would be better
than a common meet in a crowd mr weston had been so veri
earnest in hi entreati for her arriv there as soon as possibl
after themselv for the purpos of take her opinion as to the
proprieti and comfort of the room befor ani other person came
that she could not refus him and must therefor spend some quiet
interv in the young man compani she wa to convey harriet
and they drove to the crown in good time the randal parti just
suffici befor them

frank churchil seem to have been on the watch; and though
he did not say much hi eye declar that he meant to have
a delight even they all walk about togeth to see
that everi thing wa as it should be; and within a few minut
were join by the content of anoth carriag which emma
could not hear the sound of at first without great surpriz
so unreason early! she wa go to exclaim; but she present
found that it wa a famili of old friend who were come like herself
by particular desir to help mr weston judgment; and they were
so veri close follow by anoth carriag of cousin who had been
entreat to come earli with the same distinguish earnest
on the same errand that it seem as if half the compani might
soon be collect togeth for the purpos of preparatori inspect

emma perceiv that her tast wa not the onli tast on which
mr weston depend and felt that to be the favourit and
intim of a man who had so mani intim and confidant
wa not the veri first distinct in the scale of vaniti
she like hi open manner but a littl less of open-hearted
would have made him a higher character--gener benevol
but not gener friendship made a man what he ought to be--
she could fanci such a man the whole parti walk about
and look and prais again; and then have noth els to do
form a sort of half-circl round the fire to observ in their
variou mode till other subject were start that though _may_
a fire in the even wa still veri pleasant

emma found that it wa not mr weston fault that the number
of privi councillor wa not yet larger they had stop
at mr batess door to offer the use of their carriag
but the aunt and niec were to be brought by the elton

frank wa stand by her but not steadily; there wa a restless
which shew a mind not at eas he wa look about he wa go
to the door he wa watch for the sound of other carriages--
impati to begin or afraid of be alway near her

mr elton wa spoken of i think she must be here soon said he
i have a great curios to see mr elton i have heard so much
of her it cannot be long i think befor she come

a carriag wa heard he wa on the move immediately;
but come back said

i am forget that i am not acquaint with her i have never seen
either mr or mr elton i have no busi to put myself forward

mr and mr elton appeared; and all the smile and the proprieti pass

but miss bate and miss fairfax! said mr weston look about
we thought you were to bring them

the mistak had been slight the carriag wa sent for them now
emma long to know what frank first opinion of mr elton
might be; how he wa affect by the studi eleg of her dress
and her smile of gracious he wa immedi qualifi
himself to form an opinion by give her veri proper attent
after the introduct had pass

in a few minut the carriag returned--somebodi talk of rain--
i will see that there are umbrella sir said frank to hi father:
miss bate must not be forgotten: and away he went mr weston
wa following; but mr elton detain him to gratifi him by her
opinion of hi son; and so briskli did she begin that the young
man himself though by no mean move slowli could hardli be out
of hear

a veri fine young man inde mr weston you know i candidli told
you i should form my own opinion; and i am happi to say that i am
extrem pleas with him--you may believ me i never compliment
i think him a veri handsom young man and hi manner are precis
what i like and approve--so truli the gentleman without the least
conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislik to puppies--
quit a horror of them they were never toler at mapl grove
neither mr suckl nor me had ever ani patienc with them; and we
use sometim to say veri cut things! selina who is mild almost
to a fault bore with them much better

while she talk of hi son mr weston attent wa chained;
but when she got to mapl grove he could recollect that there were
ladi just arriv to be attend to and with happi smile must
hurri away

mr elton turn to mr weston i have no doubt of it be
our carriag with miss bate and jane our coachman and hors are
so extrem expeditious!--i believ we drive faster than ani body--
what a pleasur it is to send one carriag for a friend!--
i understand you were so kind as to offer but anoth time it
will be quit unnecessari you may be veri sure i shall alway
take care of _them_

miss bate and miss fairfax escort by the two gentlemen
walk into the room; and mr elton seem to think it as much
her duti as mr weston to receiv them her gestur and
movement might be understood by ani one who look on like emma;
but her word everi bodi word were soon lost under the
incess flow of miss bate who came in talk and had not
finish her speech under mani minut after her be admit
into the circl at the fire as the door open she wa heard

frank churchil return to hi station by emma; and as soon as miss
bate wa quiet she found herself necessarili overhear the
discours of mr elton and miss fairfax who were stand a littl
way behind her--h wa thought whether he were overhear too
she could not determin after a good mani compliment to jane
on her dress and look compliment veri quietli and properli taken
mr elton wa evid want to be compliment herself--
and it wa how do you like my gown?--how do you like my trimming?--
how ha wright done my hair?--with mani other rel question
all answer with patient polit mr elton then said
nobodi can think less of dress in gener than i do--but upon such
an occas as thi when everi bodi eye are so much upon me
and in compliment to the westons--who i have no doubt are give
thi ball chiefli to do me honour--i would not wish to be inferior
to other and i see veri few pearl in the room except mine--
so frank churchil is a capit dancer i understand--w shall see
if our style suit--a fine young man certainli is frank churchil
i like him veri well

at thi moment frank began talk so vigor that emma could
not but imagin he had overheard hi own prais and did not want
to hear more;--and the voic of the ladi were drown for a while
till anoth suspens brought mr elton tone again distinctli
forward--mr elton had just join them and hi wife wa exclaim

oh! you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion?--
i wa thi moment tell jane i thought you would begin to be
impati for tide of us

jane!--rep frank churchil with a look of surpriz and displeasure--
that is easy--but miss fairfax doe not disapprov it i suppos

how do you like mr elton? said emma in a whisper

not at all

you are ungrat

ungrateful!--what do you mean? then chang from a frown to
a smile--no do not tell me--i do not want to know what you mean--
where is my father?--when are we to begin dancing?

emma could hardli understand him; he seem in an odd humour
he walk off to find hi father but wa quickli back again with both
mr and mr weston he had met with them in a littl perplex
which must be laid befor emma it had just occur to mr weston
that mr elton must be ask to begin the ball; that she would
expect it; which interf with all their wish of give emma
that distinction--emma heard the sad truth with fortitud

and what are we to do for a proper partner for her? said mr weston
she will think frank ought to ask her

frank turn instantli to emma to claim her former promise;
and boast himself an engag man which hi father look hi most
perfect approb of--and it then appear that mr weston wa
want _him_ to danc with mr elton himself and that their busi
wa to help to persuad him into it which wa done pretti soon--
mr weston and mr elton led the way mr frank churchil and miss
woodhous follow emma must submit to stand second to mr elton
though she had alway consid the ball as peculiarli for her
it wa almost enough to make her think of marri mr elton had
undoubtedli the advantag at thi time in vaniti complet gratified;
for though she had intend to begin with frank churchil she could
not lose by the chang mr weston might be hi son superior--
in spite of thi littl rub howev emma wa smile with enjoy
delight to see the respect length of the set as it wa form
and to feel that she had so mani hour of unusu festiv befor her--
she wa more disturb by mr knightley not danc than by ani
thing else--ther he wa among the standers-bi where he ought not
to be; he ought to be dancing--not class himself with the husband
and father and whist-play who were pretend to feel an interest
in the danc till their rubber were made up--so young as he looked!--
he could not have appear to greater advantag perhap anywher
than where he had place himself hi tall firm upright figur
among the bulki form and stoop shoulder of the elderli men
wa such as emma felt must draw everi bodi eyes; and except her
own partner there wa not one among the whole row of young men
who could be compar with him--h move a few step nearer
and those few step were enough to prove in how gentlemanlik
a manner with what natur grace he must have danc would he
but take the trouble--whenev she caught hi eye she forc him
to smile; but in gener he wa look grave she wish he could
love a ballroom better and could like frank churchil better--
he seem often observ her she must not flatter herself that he
thought of her danc but if he were criticis her behaviour
she did not feel afraid there wa noth like flirtat between
her and her partner they seem more like cheer easi friend
than lover that frank churchil thought less of her than he had done
wa indubit

the ball proceed pleasantli the anxiou care the incess
attent of mr weston were not thrown away everi bodi
seem happy; and the prais of be a delight ball
which is seldom bestow till after a ball ha ceas to be
wa repeatedli given in the veri begin of the exist of thi
of veri import veri record event it wa not more product
than such meet usual are there wa one howev which emma
thought someth of--th two last danc befor supper were begun
and harriet had no partner;--th onli young ladi sit down;--
and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancer that how there
could be ani one disengag wa the wonder!--but emma wonder
lessen soon afterward on see mr elton saunter about
he would not ask harriet to danc if it were possibl to be avoided:
she wa sure he would not--and she wa expect him everi moment to
escap into the card-room

escap howev wa not hi plan he came to the part of the room
where the sitters-bi were collect spoke to some and walk about
in front of them as if to shew hi liberti and hi resolut
of maintain it he did not omit be sometim directli
befor miss smith or speak to those who were close to her--
emma saw it she wa not yet dancing; she wa work her way
up from the bottom and had therefor leisur to look around
and by onli turn her head a littl she saw it all when she wa
half-way up the set the whole group were exactli behind her and she
would no longer allow her eye to watch; but mr elton wa so near
that she heard everi syllabl of a dialogu which just then took
place between him and mr weston; and she perceiv that hi wife
who wa stand immedi abov her wa not onli listen also
but even encourag him by signific glances--th kind-heart
gentl mr weston had left her seat to join him and say do not
you danc mr elton? to which hi prompt repli wa most readili
mr weston if you will danc with me

me!--oh! no--i would get you a better partner than myself
i am no dancer

if mr gilbert wish to danc said he i shall have great pleasur
i am sure--for though begin to feel myself rather an old marri man
and that my danc day are over it would give me veri great
pleasur at ani time to stand up with an old friend like mr gilbert

mr gilbert doe not mean to danc but there is a young ladi
disengag whom i should be veri glad to see dancing--miss smith
miss smith!--oh!--i had not observed--y are extrem obliging--
and if i were not an old marri man--but my danc day are over
mr weston you will excus me ani thing els i should be most happi
to do at your command--but my danc day are over

mr weston said no more; and emma could imagin with what
surpriz and mortif she must be return to her seat
thi wa mr elton! the amiabl oblig gentl mr elton--
she look round for a moment; he had join mr knightley at a
littl distanc and wa arrang himself for settl convers
while smile of high glee pass between him and hi wife

she would not look again her heart wa in a glow and she fear
her face might be as hot

in anoth moment a happier sight caught her;--mr knightley
lead harriet to the set!--nev had she been more surpriz
seldom more delight than at that instant she wa all pleasur
and gratitud both for harriet and herself and long to be
thank him; and though too distant for speech her counten
said much as soon as she could catch hi eye again

hi danc prove to be just what she had believ it
extrem good; and harriet would have seem almost too lucki
if it had not been for the cruel state of thing befor and for
the veri complet enjoy and veri high sens of the distinct
which her happi featur announc it wa not thrown away on her
she bound higher than ever flew farther down the middl
and wa in a continu cours of smile

mr elton had retreat into the card-room look (emma trusted)
veri foolish she did not think he wa quit so harden as hi wife
though grow veri like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feel
by observ audibl to her partner

knightley ha taken piti on poor littl miss smith!--veri goodnatur
i declar

supper wa announc the move began; and miss bate might be
heard from that moment without interrupt till her be
seat at tabl and take up her spoon

jane jane my dear jane where are you?--her is your tippet
mr weston beg you to put on your tippet she say she is afraid
there will be draught in the passag though everi thing ha
been done--on door nail up--quant of matting--mi dear jane
inde you must mr churchil oh! you are too obliging!
how well you put it on!--so gratified! excel danc indeed!--
ye my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama
to bed and got back again and nobodi miss me--i set off without
say a word just as i told you grandmama wa quit well
had a charm even with mr woodhous a vast deal of chat
and backgammon--tea wa made downstair biscuit and bake appl
and wine befor she came away: amaz luck in some of her throws:
and she inquir a great deal about you how you were amus
and who were your partner `oh! said i `i shall not forestal jane;
i left her danc with mr georg otway; she will love to tell you
all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner wa mr elton
i do not know who will ask her next perhap mr william cox
my dear sir you are too obliging--i there nobodi you would
not rather?--i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word
jane on one arm and me on the other!--stop stop let us stand
a littl back mr elton is going; dear mr elton how eleg
she looks!--beauti lace!--now we all follow in her train
quit the queen of the evening!--wel here we are at the passag
two step jane take care of the two step oh! no there is
but one well i wa persuad there were two how veri odd!
i wa convinc there were two and there is but one i never saw ani
thing equal to the comfort and style--candl everywhere--i wa tell
you of your grandmama jane--ther wa a littl disappointment--
the bake appl and biscuit excel in their way you know;
but there wa a delic fricasse of sweetbread and some asparagu
brought in at first and good mr woodhous not think the
asparagu quit boil enough sent it all out again now there
is noth grandmama love better than sweetbread and asparagus--
so she wa rather disappoint but we agre we would not speak of it
to ani bodi for fear of it get round to dear miss woodhous
who would be so veri much concerned!--wel thi is brilliant!
i am all amazement! could not have suppos ani thing!--such
eleg and profusion!--i have seen noth like it since--
well where shall we sit? where shall we sit? anywher so that
jane is not in a draught where _i_ sit is of no consequ
oh! do you recommend thi side?--wel i am sure mr churchill--
onli it seem too good--but just as you pleas what you direct
in thi hous cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever
recollect half the dish for grandmama? soup too! bless me!
i should not be help so soon but it smell most excel and i
cannot help begin

emma had no opportun of speak to mr knightley till
after supper; but when they were all in the ballroom again
her eye invit him irresist to come to her and be thank
he wa warm in hi reprob of mr elton conduct; it had been
unpardon rudeness; and mr elton look also receiv the due
share of censur

they aim at wound more than harriet said he emma whi
is it that they are your enemies?

he look with smile penetration; and on receiv
no answer ad _she_ ought not to be angri with you i suspect
whatev he may be--to that surmis you say noth of course;
but confess emma that you did want him to marri harriet

i did repli emma and they cannot forgiv me

he shook hi head; but there wa a smile of indulg with it
and he onli said

i shall not scold you i leav you to your own reflect

can you trust me with such flatterers?--do my vain spirit ever
tell me i am wrong?

not your vain spirit but your seriou spirit--if one lead
you wrong i am sure the other tell you of it

i do own myself to have been complet mistaken in mr elton
there is a littl about him which you discov and which i
did not: and i wa fulli convinc of hi be in love with harriet
it wa through a seri of strang blunders!

and in return for your acknowledg so much i will do you the justic
to say that you would have chosen for him better than he ha chosen for
himself--harriet smith ha some first-rat qualiti which mr elton
is total without an unpretend single-mind artless girl--
infinit to be prefer by ani man of sens and tast to such
a woman as mr elton i found harriet more convers than i expect

emma wa extrem gratified--they were interrupt by the bustl
of mr weston call on everi bodi to begin danc again

come miss woodhous miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing?--
come emma set your companion the exampl everi bodi is lazy!
everi bodi is asleep!

i am readi said emma whenev i am want

whom are you go to danc with? ask mr knightley

she hesit a moment and then repli with you if you will
ask me

will you? said he offer hi hand

inde i will you have shewn that you can danc and you know we
are not realli so much brother and sister as to make it at all improp

brother and sister! no inde



chapter iii


thi littl explan with mr knightley gave emma consider
pleasur it wa one of the agreeabl recollect of the ball
which she walk about the lawn the next morn to enjoy--sh wa
extrem glad that they had come to so good an understand respect
the elton and that their opinion of both husband and wife were so
much alike; and hi prais of harriet hi concess in her favour
wa peculiarli gratifi the impertin of the elton which for
a few minut had threaten to ruin the rest of her even had been
the occas of some of it highest satisfactions; and she look
forward to anoth happi result--th cure of harriet infatuation--
from harriet manner of speak of the circumst befor they
quit the ballroom she had strong hope it seem as if her eye
were suddenli open and she were enabl to see that mr elton
wa not the superior creatur she had believ him the fever
wa over and emma could harbour littl fear of the puls be
quicken again by injuri courtesi she depend on the evil
feel of the elton for suppli all the disciplin of point
neglect that could be farther requisite--harriet ration
frank churchil not too much in love and mr knightley not
want to quarrel with her how veri happi a summer must be befor her!

she wa not to see frank churchil thi morn he had told
her that he could not allow himself the pleasur of stop
at hartfield as he wa to be at home by the middl of the day
she did not regret it

have arrang all these matter look them through and put them all
to right she wa just turn to the hous with spirit freshen up
for the demand of the two littl boy as well as of their grandpapa
when the great iron sweep-gat open and two person enter
whom she had never less expect to see together--frank churchil
with harriet lean on hi arm--actu harriet!--a moment
suffic to convinc her that someth extraordinari had happen
harriet look white and frighten and he wa tri to cheer her--
the iron gate and the front-door were not twenti yard asunder;--
they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immedi sink
into a chair faint away

a young ladi who faint must be recovered; question must be answer
and surpriz be explain such event are veri interest
but the suspens of them cannot last long a few minut made emma
acquaint with the whole

miss smith and miss bickerton anoth parlour boarder at
mr goddard who had been also at the ball had walk out togeth
and taken a road the richmond road which though appar public
enough for safeti had led them into alarm--about half a mile
beyond highburi make a sudden turn and deepli shade by elm
on each side it becam for a consider stretch veri retired;
and when the young ladi had advanc some way into it
they had suddenli perceiv at a small distanc befor them
on a broader patch of greensward by the side a parti of gipsi
a child on the watch came toward them to beg; and miss bickerton
excess frighten gave a great scream and call on harriet
to follow her ran up a steep bank clear a slight hedg at the top
and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highburi
but poor harriet could not follow she had suffer veri much
from cramp after danc and her first attempt to mount the bank
brought on such a return of it as made her absolut powerless--
and in thi state and exceedingli terrifi she had been oblig
to remain

how the tramper might have behav had the young ladi been
more courag must be doubtful; but such an invit for attack
could not be resisted; and harriet wa soon assail by half a
dozen children head by a stout woman and a great boy all clamor
and impertin in look though not absolut in word--mor and
more frighten she immedi promis them money and take out
her purs gave them a shill and beg them not to want more
or to use her ill--sh wa then abl to walk though but slowli
and wa move away--but her terror and her purs were too tempt
and she wa follow or rather surround by the whole gang
demand more

in thi state frank churchil had found her she trembl
and condit they loud and insol by a most fortun
chanc hi leav highburi had been delay so as to bring him
to her assist at thi critic moment the pleasant
of the morn had induc him to walk forward and leav hi
hors to meet him by anoth road a mile or two beyond highbury--
and happen to have borrow a pair of scissor the night befor
of miss bate and to have forgotten to restor them he had
been oblig to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes:
he wa therefor later than he had intended; and be on foot
wa unseen by the whole parti till almost close to them
the terror which the woman and boy had been creat in harriet
wa then their own portion he had left them complet frightened;
and harriet eagerli cling to him and hardli abl to speak
had just strength enough to reach hartfield befor her spirit
were quit overcom it wa hi idea to bring her to hartfield:
he had thought of no other place

thi wa the amount of the whole story--of hi commun and
of harriet as soon as she had recov her sens and speech--
he dare not stay longer than to see her well; these sever delay
left him not anoth minut to lose; and emma engag to give
assur of her safeti to mr goddard and notic of there
be such a set of peopl in the neighbourhood to mr knightley
he set off with all the grate bless that she could utter
for her friend and herself

such an adventur as this--a fine young man and a love young
woman thrown togeth in such a way could hardli fail of suggest
certain idea to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain
so emma thought at least could a linguist could a grammarian
could even a mathematician have seen what she did have wit their
appear togeth and heard their histori of it without feel
that circumst had been at work to make them peculiarli interest
to each other?--how much more must an imaginist like herself
be on fire with specul and foresight!--especi with such
a groundwork of anticip as her mind had alreadi made

it wa a veri extraordinari thing! noth of the sort had ever
occur befor to ani young ladi in the place within her memory;
no rencontr no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happen
to the veri person and at the veri hour when the other veri
person wa chanc to pass by to rescu her!--it certainli
wa veri extraordinary!--and know as she did the favour
state of mind of each at thi period it struck her the more
he wa wish to get the better of hi attach to herself
she just recov from her mania for mr elton it seem as if
everi thing unit to promis the most interest consequ
it wa not possibl that the occurr should not be strongli
recommend each to the other

in the few minut convers which she had yet had with him
while harriet had been partial insens he had spoken of her terror
her naivet her fervour as she seiz and clung to hi arm with a
sensibl amus and delighted; and just at last after harriet
own account had been given he had express hi indign
at the abomin folli of miss bickerton in the warmest term
everi thing wa to take it natur cours howev neither impel
nor assist she would not stir a step nor drop a hint
no she had had enough of interfer there could be no harm
in a scheme a mere passiv scheme it wa no more than a wish
beyond it she would on no account proceed

emma first resolut wa to keep her father from the knowledg
of what had passed--awar of the anxieti and alarm it would occasion:
but she soon felt that conceal must be imposs within half
an hour it wa known all over highburi it wa the veri event
to engag those who talk most the young and the low; and all
the youth and servant in the place were soon in the happi of
fright news the last night ball seem lost in the gipsi
poor mr woodhous trembl as he sat and as emma had foreseen
would scarc be satisfi without their promis never to go
beyond the shrubberi again it wa some comfort to him that mani
inquiri after himself and miss woodhous (for hi neighbour
knew that he love to be inquir after) as well as miss smith
were come in dure the rest of the day; and he had the pleasur
of return for answer that they were all veri indifferent--
which though not exactli true for she wa perfectli well
and harriet not much otherwis emma would not interfer with
she had an unhappi state of health in gener for the child of such
a man for she hardli knew what indisposit was; and if he did not
invent ill for her she could make no figur in a messag

the gipsi did not wait for the oper of justice; they took
themselv off in a hurri the young ladi of highburi might have
walk again in safeti befor their panic began and the whole
histori dwindl soon into a matter of littl import but to emma
and her nephews:--in her imagin it maintain it ground
and henri and john were still ask everi day for the stori of
harriet and the gipsi and still tenaci set her right
if she vari in the slightest particular from the origin recit



chapter iv


a veri few day had pass after thi adventur when harriet came
one morn to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after
sit down and hesit thu began:

miss woodhouse--if you are at leisure--i have someth that i
should like to tell you--a sort of confess to make--and then
you know it will be over

emma wa a good deal surprized; but beg her to speak
there wa a serious in harriet manner which prepar her
quit as much as her word for someth more than ordinari

it is my duti and i am sure it is my wish she continu
to have no reserv with you on thi subject as i am happili
quit an alter creatur in _one_ _respect_ it is veri fit that you
should have the satisfact of know it i do not want to say
more than is necessary--i am too much asham of have given way
as i have done and i dare say you understand me

ye said emma i hope i do

how i could so long a time be fanci myself!
cri harriet warmli it seem like madness! i can see noth
at all extraordinari in him now--i do not care whether i meet
him or not--except that of the two i had rather not see him--
and inde i would go ani distanc round to avoid him--but i do
not envi hi wife in the least; i neither admir her nor envi her
as i have done: she is veri charm i dare say and all that
but i think her veri ill-temp and disagreeable--i shall never forget
her look the other night!--howev i assur you miss woodhous
i wish her no evil--no let them be ever so happi togeth
it will not give me anoth moment pang: and to convinc you
that i have been speak truth i am now go to destroy--what i
ought to have destroy long ago--what i ought never to have kept--
i know that veri well (blush as she spoke)--howev now i
will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it
in your presenc that you may see how ration i am grown
cannot you guess what thi parcel holds? said she with a consciou look

not the least in the world--did he ever give you ani thing?

no--i cannot call them gifts; but they are thing that i have
valu veri much

she held the parcel toward her and emma read the word _most_
_precious_ _treasures_ on the top her curios wa greatli excit
harriet unfold the parcel and she look on with impati
within abund of silver paper wa a pretti littl tunbridge-war box
which harriet opened: it wa well line with the softest cotton;
but except the cotton emma saw onli a small piec of court-plaist

now said harriet you _must_ recollect

no inde i do not

dear me! i should not have thought it possibl you could forget
what pass in thi veri room about court-plaist one of the veri
last time we ever met in it!--it wa but a veri few day befor i
had my sore throat--just befor mr and mr john knightley came--
i think the veri evening--do not you rememb hi cut hi finger
with your new penknif and your recommend court-plaister?--
but as you had none about you and knew i had you desir
me to suppli him; and so i took mine out and cut him a piece;
but it wa a great deal too larg and he cut it smaller and kept
play some time with what wa left befor he gave it back to me
and so then in my nonsens i could not help make a treasur of it--
so i put it by never to be use and look at it now and then
as a great treat

my dearest harriet! cri emma put her hand befor her face
and jump up you make me more asham of myself than i can bear
rememb it? aye i rememb it all now; all except your save
thi relic--i knew noth of that till thi moment--but the cut
the finger and my recommend court-plaist and say i had none
about me!--oh! my sin my sins!--and i had plenti all the while in
my pocket!--on of my senseless tricks!--i deserv to be under a
continu blush all the rest of my life--well--(sit down again)--
go on--what else?

and had you realli some at hand yourself? i am sure i never
suspect it you did it so natur

and so you actual put thi piec of court-plaist by for hi sake!
said emma recov from her state of shame and feel divid
between wonder and amus and secretli she ad to herself
lord bless me! when should i ever have thought of put by in cotton
a piec of court-plaist that frank churchil had been pull about!
i never wa equal to thi

here resum harriet turn to her box again here is
someth still more valuabl i mean that _has_ _been_ more valuabl
becaus thi is what did realli onc belong to him which the
court-plaist never did

emma wa quit eager to see thi superior treasur it wa the end
of an old pencil--th part without ani lead

thi wa realli hi said harriet--do not you rememb
one morning?--no i dare say you do not but one morning--i forget
exactli the day--but perhap it wa the tuesday or wednesday befor
_that_ _evening_ he want to make a memorandum in hi pocket-book;
it wa about spruce-b mr knightley had been tell him
someth about brew spruce-b and he want to put it down;
but when he took out hi pencil there wa so littl lead that he
soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him anoth
and thi wa left upon the tabl as good for noth but i kept
my eye on it; and as soon as i dare caught it up and never
part with it again from that moment

i do rememb it cri emma; i perfectli rememb it--
talk about spruce-beer--oh! yes--mr knightley and i both say we
like it and mr elton seem resolv to learn to like it too
i perfectli rememb it--stop; mr knightley wa stand just here
wa not he? i have an idea he wa stand just here

ah! i do not know i cannot recollect--it is veri odd
but i cannot recollect--mr elton wa sit here i rememb
much about where i am now--

well go on

oh! that all i have noth more to shew you or to say--
except that i am now go to throw them both behind the fire
and i wish you to see me do it

my poor dear harriet! and have you actual found happi
in treasur up these things?

ye simpleton as i was!--but i am quit asham of it now and wish
i could forget as easili as i can burn them it wa veri wrong
of me you know to keep ani remembr after he wa marri
i knew it was--but had not resolut enough to part with them

but harriet is it necessari to burn the court-plaister?--i have
not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court-plaist
might be use

i shall be happier to burn it repli harriet it ha
a disagre look to me i must get rid of everi thing--
there it goe and there is an end thank heaven! of mr elton

and when thought emma will there be a begin of mr churchill?

she had soon afterward reason to believ that the begin wa
alreadi made and could not but hope that the gipsi though she had
_told_ no fortun might be prove to have made harriets--about a
fortnight after the alarm they came to a suffici explan
and quit undesignedli emma wa not think of it at the moment
which made the inform she receiv more valuabl
she mere said in the cours of some trivial chat well harriet
whenev you marri i would advis you to do so and so--and thought
no more of it till after a minut silenc she heard harriet
say in a veri seriou tone i shall never marri

emma then look up and immedi saw how it was; and after a
moment debat as to whether it should pass unnot or not repli

never marry!--thi is a new resolut

it is one that i shall never chang howev

after anoth short hesit i hope it doe not proceed from--
i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton?

mr elton indeed! cri harriet indignantly--oh! no--and emma
could just catch the word so superior to mr elton!

she then took a longer time for consider should she proceed
no farther?--should she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing?--
perhap harriet might think her cold or angri if she did;
or perhap if she were total silent it might onli drive
harriet into ask her to hear too much; and against ani thing
like such an unreserv as had been such an open and frequent
discuss of hope and chanc she wa perfectli resolved--
she believ it would be wiser for her to say and know at onc
all that she meant to say and know plain deal wa alway best
she had previous determin how far she would proceed
on ani applic of the sort; and it would be safer for both
to have the judici law of her own brain laid down with speed--
she wa decid and thu spoke--

harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your mean
your resolut or rather your expect of never marri
result from an idea that the person whom you might prefer
would be too greatli your superior in situat to think of you
is not it so?

oh! miss woodhous believ me i have not the presumpt to suppose--
inde i am not so mad--but it is a pleasur to me to admir him
at a distance--and to think of hi infinit superior to all
the rest of the world with the gratitud wonder and vener
which are so proper in me especi

i am not at all surpriz at you harriet the servic he render
you wa enough to warm your heart

service! oh! it wa such an inexpress obligation!--
the veri recollect of it and all that i felt at the time--
when i saw him coming--hi nobl look--and my wretched befor
such a change! in one moment such a change! from perfect miseri
to perfect happiness!

it is veri natur it is natur and it is honourable--
ye honour i think to chuse so well and so gratefully--
but that it will be a fortun prefer is more that i can promis
i do not advis you to give way to it harriet i do not by ani
mean engag for it be return consid what you are about
perhap it will be wisest in you to check your feel while you can:
at ani rate do not let them carri you far unless you are persuad
of hi like you be observ of him let hi behaviour be the
guid of your sensat i give you thi caution now becaus i
shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determin
against all interfer henceforward i know noth of the matter
let no name ever pass our lip we were veri wrong before;
we will be cautiou now--h is your superior no doubt and there
do seem object and obstacl of a veri seriou nature;
but yet harriet more wonder thing have taken place there have
been match of greater dispar but take care of yourself
i would not have you too sanguine; though howev it may end
be assur your rais your thought to _him_ is a mark of good tast
which i shall alway know how to valu

harriet kiss her hand in silent and submiss gratitud
emma wa veri decid in think such an attach no bad thing
for her friend it tendenc would be to rais and refin her mind--
and it must be save her from the danger of degrad



chapter v


in thi state of scheme and hope and conniv june open
upon hartfield to highburi in gener it brought no materi chang
the elton were still talk of a visit from the suckl
and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and jane fairfax
wa still at her grandmothers; and as the return of the campbel
from ireland wa again delay and august instead of midsumm
fix for it she wa like to remain there full two month longer
provid at least she were abl to defeat mr elton activ
in her servic and save herself from be hurri into a delight
situat against her will

mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainli
taken an earli dislik to frank churchil wa onli grow to dislik
him more he began to suspect him of some doubl deal in hi
pursuit of emma that emma wa hi object appear indisput
everi thing declar it; hi own attent hi father hint
hi mother-in-law guard silence; it wa all in unison;
word conduct discret and indiscret told the same stori
but while so mani were devot him to emma and emma herself make him
over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclin
to trifl with jane fairfax he could not understand it; but there
were symptom of intellig between them--h thought so at least--
symptom of admir on hi side which have onc observ
he could not persuad himself to think entir void of mean
howev he might wish to escap ani of emma error of imagin
_she_ wa not present when the suspicion first aros he wa dine
with the randal famili and jane at the eltons; and he had
seen a look more than a singl look at miss fairfax which
from the admir of miss woodhous seem somewhat out of place
when he wa again in their compani he could not help rememb
what he had seen; nor could he avoid observ which unless it
were like cowper and hi fire at twilight

myself creat what i saw

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there be a someth
of privat like of privat understand even between frank
churchil and jane

he had walk up one day after dinner as he veri often did
to spend hi even at hartfield emma and harriet were go
to walk; he join them; and on return they fell in with a
larger parti who like themselv judg it wisest to take their
exercis earli as the weather threaten rain; mr and mr weston
and their son miss bate and her niec who had accident met
they all united; and on reach hartfield gate emma who knew it
wa exactli the sort of visit that would be welcom to her father
press them all to go in and drink tea with him the randal
parti agre to it immediately; and after a pretti long speech
from miss bate which few person listen to she also found it
possibl to accept dear miss woodhous most oblig invit

as they were turn into the ground mr perri pass by on horseback
the gentlemen spoke of hi hors

by the bye said frank churchil to mr weston present
what becam of mr perri plan of set up hi carriage?

mr weston look surpriz and said i did not know that he
ever had ani such plan

nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three month ago

me! impossible!

inde you did i rememb it perfectli you mention it as
what wa certainli to be veri soon mr perri had told somebodi
and wa extrem happi about it it wa owe to _her_ persuas
as she thought hi be out in bad weather did him a great deal
of harm you must rememb it now?

upon my word i never heard of it till thi moment

never! realli never!--bless me! how could it be?--then i must
have dreamt it--but i wa complet persuaded--miss smith
you walk as if you were tire you will not be sorri to find
yourself at home

what is this?--what is this? cri mr weston about perri
and a carriage? is perri go to set up hi carriag frank?
i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you?

no sir repli hi son laugh i seem to have had it
from nobody--veri odd!--i realli wa persuad of mr weston
have mention it in one of her letter to enscomb mani week ago
with all these particulars--but as she declar she never heard
a syllabl of it befor of cours it must have been a dream i am
a great dreamer i dream of everi bodi at highburi when i am away--
and when i have gone through my particular friend then i begin
dream of mr and mr perri

it is odd though observ hi father that you should have had such
a regular connect dream about peopl whom it wa not veri like you
should be think of at enscomb perri set up hi carriage!
and hi wife persuad him to it out of care for hi health--
just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other;
onli a littl prematur what an air of probabl sometim
run through a dream! and at other what a heap of absurd
it is! well frank your dream certainli shew that highburi is in
your thought when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer
i think?

emma wa out of hear she had hurri on befor her guest
to prepar her father for their appear and wa beyond the reach
of mr weston hint

whi to own the truth cri miss bate who had been tri in vain
to be heard the last two minut if i must speak on thi subject
there is no deni that mr frank churchil might have--i do not
mean to say that he did not dream it--i am sure i have sometim
the oddest dream in the world--but if i am question about it
i must acknowledg that there wa such an idea last spring;
for mr perri herself mention it to my mother and the cole
knew of it as well as ourselves--but it wa quit a secret
known to nobodi els and onli thought of about three day
mr perri wa veri anxiou that he should have a carriag and came
to my mother in great spirit one morn becaus she thought she
had prevail jane dont you rememb grandmama tell us
of it when we got home? i forget where we had been walk to--
veri like to randalls; ye i think it wa to randal
mr perri wa alway particularli fond of my mother--inde i do
not know who is not--and she had mention it to her in confidence;
she had no object to her tell us of cours but it wa not
to go beyond: and from that day to thi i never mention it
to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not posit
answer for my have never dropt a hint becaus i know i do
sometim pop out a thing befor i am awar i am a talker
you know; i am rather a talker; and now and then i have let a thing
escap me which i should not i am not like jane; i wish i were
i will answer for it _she_ never betray the least thing in the world
where is she?--oh! just behind perfectli rememb mr perri coming--
extraordinari dream indeed!

they were enter the hall mr knightley eye had preced
miss batess in a glanc at jane from frank churchil face
where he thought he saw confus suppress or laugh away
he had involuntarili turn to hers; but she wa inde behind
and too busi with her shawl mr weston had walk in the two
other gentlemen wait at the door to let her pass mr knightley
suspect in frank churchil the determin of catch her eye--
he seem watch her intently--in vain howev if it were so--
jane pass between them into the hall and look at neither

there wa no time for farther remark or explan the dream must
be born with and mr knightley must take hi seat with the rest round
the larg modern circular tabl which emma had introduc at hartfield
and which none but emma could have had power to place there and
persuad her father to use instead of the small-siz pembrok
on which two of hi daili meal had for forti year been crowd
tea pass pleasantli and nobodi seem in a hurri to move

miss woodhous said frank churchil after examin a tabl
behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephew taken
away their alphabets--their box of letters? it use to stand here
where is it? thi is a sort of dull-look even that ought
to be treat rather as winter than summer we had great amus
with those letter one morn i want to puzzl you again

emma wa pleas with the thought; and produc the box the tabl
wa quickli scatter over with alphabet which no one seem so much
dispos to employ as their two selv they were rapidli form
word for each other or for ani bodi els who would be puzzl
the quiet of the game made it particularli elig for
mr woodhous who had often been distress by the more anim sort
which mr weston had occasion introduc and who now sat happili
occupi in lament with tender melancholi over the departur
of the poor littl boy or in fondli point out as he took
up ani stray letter near him how beauti emma had written it

frank churchil place a word befor miss fairfax she gave
a slight glanc round the tabl and appli herself to it
frank wa next to emma jane opposit to them--and mr knightley
so place as to see them all; and it wa hi object to see as much
as he could with as littl appar observ the word
wa discov and with a faint smile push away if meant
to be immedi mix with the other and buri from sight
she should have look on the tabl instead of look just across
for it wa not mixed; and harriet eager after everi fresh word
and find out none directli took it up and fell to work
she wa sit by mr knightley and turn to him for help
the word wa _blunder_; and as harriet exultingli proclaim it
there wa a blush on jane cheek which gave it a mean not
otherwis ostens mr knightley connect it with the dream;
but how it could all be wa beyond hi comprehens
how the delicaci the discret of hi favourit could have been
so lain asleep! he fear there must be some decid involv
disingenu and doubl deal seem to meet him at everi turn
these letter were but the vehicl for gallantri and trick
it wa a child play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank
churchil part

with great indign did he continu to observ him; with great
alarm and distrust to observ also hi two blind companion
he saw a short word prepar for emma and given to her with a look
sli and demur he saw that emma had soon made it out and found
it highli entertain though it wa someth which she judg it
proper to appear to censure; for she said nonsense! for shame!
he heard frank churchil next say with a glanc toward jane
i will give it to her--shal i?--and as clearli heard emma
oppos it with eager laugh warmth no no you must not;
you shall not inde

it wa done howev thi gallant young man who seem to love
without feel and to recommend himself without complais
directli hand over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular
degre of sedat civil entreat her to studi it mr knightley
excess curios to know what thi word might be made him seiz
everi possibl moment for dart hi eye toward it and it wa
not long befor he saw it to be _dixon_ jane fairfax percept
seem to accompani his; her comprehens wa certainli more equal
to the covert mean the superior intellig of those five letter
so arrang she wa evid displeased; look up and see
herself watch blush more deepli than he had ever perceiv her
and say onli i did not know that proper name were allow
push away the letter with even an angri spirit and look
resolv to be engag by no other word that could be offer
her face wa avert from those who had made the attack and turn
toward her aunt

aye veri true my dear cri the latter though jane had not
spoken a word--i wa just go to say the same thing it is time
for us to be go inde the even is close in and grandmama
will be look for us my dear sir you are too oblig
we realli must wish you good night

jane alert in move prove her as readi as her aunt
had preconceiv she wa immedi up and want to quit
the table; but so mani were also move that she could not get away;
and mr knightley thought he saw anoth collect of letter anxious
push toward her and resolut swept away by her unexamin
she wa afterward look for her shawl--frank churchil wa
look also--it wa grow dusk and the room wa in confusion;
and how they part mr knightley could not tell

he remain at hartfield after all the rest hi thought full
of what he had seen; so full that when the candl came to assist
hi observ he must--y he certainli must as a friend--
an anxiou friend--giv emma some hint ask her some question
he could not see her in a situat of such danger without tri to
preserv her it wa hi duti

pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amus
the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax?
i saw the word and am curiou to know how it could be so veri
entertain to the one and so veri distress to the other

emma wa extrem confus she could not endur to give him the
true explanation; for though her suspicion were by no mean remov
she wa realli asham of have ever impart them

oh! she cri in evid embarrass it all meant nothing;
a mere joke among ourselv

the joke he repli grave seem confin to you
and mr churchil

he had hope she would speak again but she did not she would
rather busi herself about ani thing than speak he sat a littl
while in doubt a varieti of evil cross hi mind interference--
fruitless interfer emma confus and the acknowledg intimaci
seem to declar her affect engag yet he would speak
he owe it to her to risk ani thing that might be involv in
an unwelcom interfer rather than her welfare; to encount
ani thing rather than the remembr of neglect in such a caus

my dear emma said he at last with earnest kind do you
think you perfectli understand the degre of acquaint between
the gentleman and ladi we have been speak of?

between mr frank churchil and miss fairfax? oh! ye perfectly--
whi do you make a doubt of it?

have you never at ani time had reason to think that he admir her
or that she admir him?

never never! she cri with a most open eagerness--nev for
the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me
and how could it possibl come into your head?

i have late imagin that i saw symptom of attach between them--
certain express look which i did not believ meant to be public

oh! you amus me excess i am delight to find that you
can vouchsaf to let your imagin wander--but it will not do--
veri sorri to check you in your first essay--but inde it will
not do there is no admir between them i do assur you;
and the appear which have caught you have arisen from some
peculiar circumstances--feel rather of a total differ nature--
it is imposs exactli to explain:--ther is a good deal of
nonsens in it--but the part which is capabl of be commun
which is sens is that they are as far from ani attach or
admir for one anoth as ani two be in the world can be
that is i _presume_ it to be so on her side and i can _answer_ for it
be so on hi i will answer for the gentleman indiffer

she spoke with a confid which stagger with a satisfact
which silenc mr knightley she wa in gay spirit and would
have prolong the convers want to hear the particular
of hi suspicion everi look describ and all the where and how
of a circumst which highli entertain her: but hi gaieti did
not meet her he found he could not be use and hi feel
were too much irrit for talk that he might not be irrit
into an absolut fever by the fire which mr woodhous tender
habit requir almost everi even throughout the year he soon
afterward took a hasti leav and walk home to the cool
and solitud of donwel abbey



chapter vi


after be long fed with hope of a speedi visit from mr and
mr suckl the highburi world were oblig to endur the mortif
of hear that they could not possibl come till the autumn
no such import of novelti could enrich their intellectu store
at present in the daili interchang of news they must be again
restrict to the other topic with which for a while the suckl
come had been unit such as the last account of mr churchil
whose health seem everi day to suppli a differ report
and the situat of mr weston whose happi it wa to be hope
might eventu be as much increas by the arriv of a child
as that of all her neighbour wa by the approach of it

mr elton wa veri much disappoint it wa the delay of a great
deal of pleasur and parad her introduct and recommend
must all wait and everi project parti be still onli talk of
so she thought at first;--but a littl consider convinc
her that everi thing need not be put off whi should not they
explor to box hill though the suckl did not come? they could
go there again with them in the autumn it wa settl that they
should go to box hill that there wa to be such a parti had been
long gener known: it had even given the idea of anoth
emma had never been to box hill; she wish to see what everi bodi
found so well worth see and she and mr weston had agre
to chuse some fine morn and drive thither two or three more
of the chosen onli were to be admit to join them and it wa to
be done in a quiet unpretend eleg way infinit superior
to the bustl and prepar the regular eat and drink
and picnic parad of the elton and the suckl

thi wa so veri well understood between them that emma could
not but feel some surpris and a littl displeasur on hear
from mr weston that he had been propos to mr elton as her
brother and sister had fail her that the two parti should unit
and go together; and that as mr elton had veri readili acced
to it so it wa to be if she had no object now as her
object wa noth but her veri great dislik of mr elton
of which mr weston must alreadi be perfectli awar it wa not worth
bring forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof
to him which would be give pain to hi wife; and she found
herself therefor oblig to consent to an arrang which she
would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrang which would
probabl expos her even to the degrad of be said to be of
mr elton party! everi feel wa offended; and the forbear
of her outward submiss left a heavi arrear due of secret sever
in her reflect on the unmanag goodwil of mr weston temper

i am glad you approv of what i have done said he veri comfort
but i thought you would such scheme as these are noth
without number one cannot have too larg a parti a larg parti
secur it own amus and she is a good-natur woman after all
one could not leav her out

emma deni none of it aloud and agre to none of it in privat

it wa now the middl of june and the weather fine; and mr elton
wa grow impati to name the day and settl with mr weston
as to pigeon-pi and cold lamb when a lame carriage-hors threw
everi thing into sad uncertainti it might be week it might be
onli a few day befor the hors were useable; but no prepar
could be ventur on and it wa all melancholi stagnat
mr elton resourc were inadequ to such an attack

is not thi most vexat knightley? she cried--and such weather
for exploring!--thes delay and disappoint are quit odiou
what are we to do?--th year will wear away at thi rate
and noth done befor thi time last year i assur you we had
had a delight explor parti from mapl grove to king weston

you had better explor to donwel repli mr knightley
that may be done without hors come and eat my strawberri
they are ripen fast

if mr knightley did not begin serious he wa oblig to proceed so
for hi propos wa caught at with delight; and the oh! i should
like it of all thing wa not plainer in word than manner
donwel wa famou for it strawberry-b which seem a plea for
the invitation: but no plea wa necessary; cabbage-b would have
been enough to tempt the ladi who onli want to be go somewher
she promis him again and again to come--much often than
he doubted--and wa extrem gratifi by such a proof of intimaci
such a distinguish compliment as she chose to consid it

you may depend upon me said she i certainli will come
name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring
jane fairfax?

i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some other
whom i would wish to meet you

oh! leav all that to me onli give me a carte-blanche--i am
ladi patro you know it is my parti i will bring friend
with me

i hope you will bring elton said he: but i will not troubl
you to give ani other invit

oh! now you are look veri sli but consider--y need not be afraid
of deleg power to _me_ i am no young ladi on her prefer
marri women you know may be safe authoris it is my parti
leav it all to me i will invit your guest

no--h calmli replied--ther is but one marri woman in the world
whom i can ever allow to invit what guest she pleas to donwel
and that one is--

--mr weston i suppos interrupt mr elton rather mortifi

no--mr knightley;--and till she is in be i will manag
such matter myself

ah! you are an odd creature! she cri satisfi to have no
one prefer to herself--y are a humourist and may say what
you like quit a humourist well i shall bring jane with me--
jane and her aunt--th rest i leav to you i have no object
at all to meet the hartfield famili dont scrupl i know
you are attach to them

you certainli will meet them if i can prevail; and i shall call
on miss bate in my way home

that quit unnecessary; i see jane everi day:--but as you like
it is to be a morn scheme you know knightley; quit a simpl thing
i shall wear a larg bonnet and bring one of my littl basket
hang on my arm here--prob thi basket with pink ribbon
noth can be more simpl you see and jane will have such anoth
there is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsi parti we are
to walk about your garden and gather the strawberri ourselv
and sit under trees;--and whatev els you may like to provid
it is to be all out of doors--a tabl spread in the shade you know
everi thing as natur and simpl as possibl is not that your idea?

not quit my idea of the simpl and the natur will be to have
the tabl spread in the dining-room the natur and the simplic
of gentlemen and ladi with their servant and furnitur i think
is best observ by meal within door when you are tire of eat
strawberri in the garden there shall be cold meat in the hous

well--a you please; onli dont have a great set out and by the bye
can i or my housekeep be of ani use to you with our opinion?--
pray be sincer knightley if you wish me to talk to mr hodg
or to inspect anything--

i have not the least wish for it i thank you

well--but if ani difficulti should aris my housekeep
is extrem clever

i will answer for it that mine think herself full as clever
and would spurn ani bodi assist

i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come
on donkey jane miss bate and me--and my caro sposo walk by
i realli must talk to him about purchas a donkey in a countri
life i conceiv it to be a sort of necessary; for let a woman have
ever so mani resourc it is not possibl for her to be alway shut
up at home;--and veri long walk you know--in summer there is dust
and in winter there is dirt

you will not find either between donwel and highburi
donwel lane is never dusti and now it is perfectli dri come on
a donkey howev if you prefer it you can borrow mr cole
i would wish everi thing to be as much to your tast as possibl

that i am sure you would inde i do you justic my good friend
under that peculiar sort of dri blunt manner i know you have the
warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist--
ye believ me knightley i am fulli sensibl of your attent
to me in the whole of thi scheme you have hit upon the veri thing
to pleas me

mr knightley had anoth reason for avoid a tabl in the shade
he wish to persuad mr woodhous as well as emma to join the party;
and he knew that to have ani of them sit down out of door
to eat would inevit make him ill mr woodhous must not
under the speciou pretenc of a morn drive and an hour or two
spent at donwel be tempt away to hi miseri

he wa invit on good faith no lurk horror were to upbraid
him for hi easi credul he did consent he had not been
at donwel for two year some veri fine morn he and emma
and harriet could go veri well; and he could sit still with
mr weston while the dear girl walk about the garden
he did not suppos they could be damp now in the middl of
the day he should like to see the old hous again exceedingli
and should be veri happi to meet mr and mr elton and ani other
of hi neighbours--h could not see ani object at all to hi
and emma and harriet go there some veri fine morn
he thought it veri well done of mr knightley to invit them--
veri kind and sensible--much clever than dine out--h wa not
fond of dine out

mr knightley wa fortun in everi bodi most readi concurr
the invit wa everywher so well receiv that it seem as if
like mr elton they were all take the scheme as a particular
compliment to themselves--emma and harriet profess veri high
expect of pleasur from it; and mr weston unask
promis to get frank over to join them if possible; a proof
of approb and gratitud which could have been dispens with--
mr knightley wa then oblig to say that he should be glad
to see him; and mr weston engag to lose no time in write
and spare no argument to induc him to come

in the meanwhil the lame hors recov so fast that the parti
to box hill wa again under happi consideration; and at last donwel
wa settl for one day and box hill for the next--th weather
appear exactli right

under a bright mid-day sun at almost midsumm mr woodhous
wa safe convey in hi carriag with one window down
to partak of thi al-fresco party; and in one of the most
comfort room in the abbey especi prepar for him by a
fire all the morn he wa happili place quit at hi eas
readi to talk with pleasur of what had been achiev and advis
everi bodi to come and sit down and not to heat themselves--
mr weston who seem to have walk there on purpos to be tire
and sit all the time with him remain when all the other
were invit or persuad out hi patient listen and sympathis

it wa so long sinc emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she
wa satisfi of her father comfort she wa glad to leav him
and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memori with
more particular observ more exact understand of a hous
and ground which must ever be so interest to her and all her famili

she felt all the honest pride and complac which her allianc
with the present and futur proprietor could fairli warrant
as she view the respect size and style of the build
it suitabl becom characterist situat low and sheltered--
it ampl garden stretch down to meadow wash by a stream
of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect
had scarc a sight--and it abund of timber in row and avenu
which neither fashion nor extravag had root up--th hous
wa larger than hartfield and total unlik it cover a good
deal of ground rambl and irregular with mani comfort
and one or two handsom rooms--it wa just what it ought to be
and it look what it was--and emma felt an increas respect
for it as the resid of a famili of such true gentil
untaint in blood and understanding--som fault of temper john
knightley had; but isabella had connect herself unexception
she had given them neither men nor name nor place that could
rais a blush these were pleasant feel and she walk about
and indulg them till it wa necessari to do as the other did
and collect round the strawberry-beds--th whole parti were assembl
except frank churchil who wa expect everi moment from richmond;
and mr elton in all her apparatu of happi her larg bonnet
and her basket wa veri readi to lead the way in gather
accept or talking--strawberri and onli strawberri
could now be thought or spoken of--th best fruit in england--
everi bodi favourite--alway wholesome--thes the finest bed
and finest sorts--delight to gather for one self--th onli way
of realli enjoy them--morn decidedli the best time--nev tired--
everi sort good--hautboy infinit superior--no comparison--
the other hardli eatable--hautboy veri scarce--chili preferred--
white wood finest flavour of all--pric of strawberri in london--
abund about bristol--mapl grove--cultivation--b when to
be renewed--garden think exactli different--no gener rule--
garden never to be put out of their way--delici fruit--
onli too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--
currant more refreshing--onli object to gather strawberri
the stooping--glar sun--tir to death--could bear it no longer--
must go and sit in the shade

such for half an hour wa the conversation--interrupt onli
onc by mr weston who came out in her solicitud after her
son-in-law to inquir if he were come--and she wa a littl uneasy--
she had some fear of hi hors

seat toler in the shade were found; and now emma wa oblig
to overhear what mr elton and jane fairfax were talk of--
a situat a most desir situat wa in question mr elton
had receiv notic of it that morn and wa in raptur
it wa not with mr suckl it wa not with mr bragg
but in felic and splendour it fell short onli of them: it wa
with a cousin of mr bragg an acquaint of mr suckl
a ladi known at mapl grove delight charm superior
first circl sphere line rank everi thing--and mr elton
wa wild to have the offer close with immediately--on her side
all wa warmth energi and triumph--and she posit refus
to take her friend neg though miss fairfax continu
to assur her that she would not at present engag in ani thing
repeat the same motiv which she had been heard to urg before--
still mr elton insist on be authoris to write an acquiesc
by the morrow post--how jane could bear it at all wa astonish
to emma--sh did look vex she did speak pointedly--and at last
with a decis of action unusu to her propos a removal--
should not they walk? would not mr knightley shew them the gardens--
all the gardens?--sh wish to see the whole extent--th pertinac
of her friend seem more than she could bear

it wa hot; and after walk some time over the garden in a scatter
dispers way scarc ani three togeth they insens
follow one anoth to the delici shade of a broad short
avenu of lime which stretch beyond the garden at an equal
distanc from the river seem the finish of the pleasur grounds--
it led to nothing; noth but a view at the end over a low stone
wall with high pillar which seem intend in their erect
to give the appear of an approach to the hous which never had
been there disput howev as might be the tast of such
a termin it wa in itself a charm walk and the view
which close it extrem pretty--th consider slope at nearli
the foot of which the abbey stood gradual acquir a steeper
form beyond it grounds; and at half a mile distant wa a bank
of consider abrupt and grandeur well cloth with wood;--
and at the bottom of thi bank favour place and shelter
rose the abbey mill farm with meadow in front and the river
make a close and handsom curv around it

it wa a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind english verdur
english cultur english comfort seen under a sun bright
without be oppress

in thi walk emma and mr weston found all the other assembled;
and toward thi view she immedi perceiv mr knightley
and harriet distinct from the rest quietli lead the way
mr knightley and harriet!--it wa an odd tete-a-tete; but she wa
glad to see it--ther had been a time when he would have scorn
her as a companion and turn from her with littl ceremoni
now they seem in pleasant convers there had been a time
also when emma would have been sorri to see harriet in a spot
so favour for the abbey mill farm; but now she fear it not
it might be safe view with all it appendag of prosper
and beauti it rich pastur spread flock orchard in blossom
and light column of smoke ascending--sh join them at the wall
and found them more engag in talk than in look around
he wa give harriet inform as to mode of agricultur etc
and emma receiv a smile which seem to say these are my
own concern i have a right to talk on such subject without be
suspect of introduc robert martin--sh did not suspect him
it wa too old a story--robert martin had probabl ceas to think
of harriet--they took a few turn togeth along the walk--th shade
wa most refresh and emma found it the pleasantest part of
the day

the next remov wa to the house; they must all go in and eat;--
and they were all seat and busi and still frank churchil did
not come mr weston look and look in vain hi father would
not own himself uneasi and laugh at her fears; but she could
not be cure of wish that he would part with hi black mare
he had express himself as to come with more than common certainti
hi aunt wa so much better that he had not a doubt of get
over to them--mr churchil state howev as mani were readi
to remind her wa liabl to such sudden variat as might disappoint
her nephew in the most reason dependence--and mr weston
wa at last persuad to believ or to say that it must be
by some attack of mr churchil that he wa prevent coming--
emma look at harriet while the point wa under consideration;
she behav veri well and betray no emot

the cold repast wa over and the parti were to go out onc more
to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fish-ponds;
perhap get as far as the clover which wa to be begun cut
on the morrow or at ani rate have the pleasur of be hot
and grow cool again--mr woodhous who had alreadi taken
hi littl round in the highest part of the garden where no
damp from the river were imagin even by him stir no more;
and hi daughter resolv to remain with him that mr weston
might be persuad away by her husband to the exercis and varieti
which her spirit seem to need

mr knightley had done all in hi power for mr woodhous
entertain book of engrav drawer of medal cameo
coral shell and everi other famili collect within hi cabinet
had been prepar for hi old friend to while away the morning;
and the kind had perfectli answer mr woodhous had been
exceedingli well amus mr weston had been shew them all to him
and now he would shew them all to emma;--fortun in have no other
resembl to a child than in a total want of tast for what he saw
for he wa slow constant and methodical--befor thi second look
over wa begun howev emma walk into the hall for the sake
of a few moment free observ of the entranc and ground-plot
of the house--and wa hardli there when jane fairfax appear
come quickli in from the garden and with a look of escape--
littl expect to meet miss woodhous so soon there wa a start
at first; but miss woodhous wa the veri person she wa in quest of

will you be so kind said she when i am miss as to say
that i am gone home?--i am go thi moment--mi aunt is not awar
how late it is nor how long we have been absent--but i am sure we
shall be want and i am determin to go directly--i have said
noth about it to ani bodi it would onli be give troubl
and distress some are gone to the pond and some to the lime walk
till they all come in i shall not be missed; and when they do
will you have the good to say that i am gone?

certainli if you wish it;--but you are not go to walk
to highburi alone?

yes--what should hurt me?--i walk fast i shall be at home
in twenti minut

but it is too far inde it is to be walk quit alon
let my father servant go with you--let me order the carriag
it can be round in five minut

thank you thank you--but on no account--i would rather walk--
and for _me_ to be afraid of walk alone!--i who may so soon have
to guard others!

she spoke with great agitation; and emma veri feelingli repli
that can be no reason for your be expos to danger now
i must order the carriag the heat even would be danger--y are
fatigu alreadi

i am--sh answered--i am fatigued; but it is not the sort
of fatigue--quick walk will refresh me--miss woodhous we all
know at time what it is to be weari in spirit mine i confess
are exhaust the greatest kind you can shew me will be to let
me have my own way and onli say that i am gone when it is necessari

emma had not anoth word to oppos she saw it all; and enter
into her feel promot her quit the hous immedi
and watch her safe off with the zeal of a friend her part
look wa grateful--and her part word oh! miss woodhous
the comfort of be sometim alone!--seem to burst from
an overcharg heart and to describ somewhat of the continu
endur to be practis by her even toward some of those who
love her best

such a home indeed! such an aunt! said emma as she turn back
into the hall again i do piti you and the more sensibl
you betray of their just horror the more i shall like you

jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had onli
accomplish some view of st mark place venic when frank
churchil enter the room emma had not been think of him
she had forgotten to think of him--but she wa veri glad to see him
mr weston would be at eas the black mare wa blameless;
_they_ were right who had name mr churchil as the caus
he had been detain by a temporari increas of ill in her;
a nervou seizur which had last some hours--and he had quit given
up everi thought of come till veri late;--and had he known how hot
a ride he should have and how late with all hi hurri he must be
he believ he should not have come at all the heat wa excessive;
he had never suffer ani thing like it--almost wish he had staid
at home--noth kill him like heat--h could bear ani degre of cold
etc but heat wa intolerable--and he sat down at the greatest
possibl distanc from the slight remain of mr woodhous fire
look veri deplor

you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma

as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could veri
ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!
you will all be go soon i suppose; the whole parti break up
i met _one_ as i came--mad in such weather!--absolut madness!

emma listen and look and soon perceiv that frank churchil
state might be best defin by the express phrase of be
out of humour some peopl were alway cross when they were hot
such might be hi constitution; and as she knew that eat
and drink were often the cure of such incident complaint
she recommend hi take some refreshment; he would find abund
of everi thing in the dining-room--and she human point out
the door

no--h should not eat he wa not hungry; it would onli make
him hotter in two minut howev he relent in hi own favour;
and mutter someth about spruce-b walk off emma return
all her attent to her father say in secret--

i am glad i have done be in love with him i should not like a
man who is so soon discompos by a hot morn harriet sweet
easi temper will not mind it

he wa gone long enough to have had a veri comfort meal and came
back all the better--grown quit cool--and with good manner
like himself-- to draw a chair close to them take an interest
in their employment; and regret in a reason way that he
should be so late he wa not in hi best spirit but seem
tri to improv them; and at last made himself talk nonsens
veri agreeabl they were look over view in swisserland

as soon as my aunt get well i shall go abroad said he
i shall never be easi till i have seen some of these place
you will have my sketch some time or other to look at--or my tour
to read--or my poem i shall do someth to expos myself

that may be--but not by sketch in swisserland you will
never go to swisserland your uncl and aunt will never allow
you to leav england

they may be induc to go too a warm climat may be prescrib
for her i have more than half an expect of our all go abroad
i assur you i have i feel a strong persuas thi morn
that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tire
of do noth i want a chang i am seriou miss woodhous
whatev your penetr eye may fancy--i am sick of england--
and would leav it to-morrow if i could

you are sick of prosper and indulg cannot you invent
a few hardship for yourself and be content to stay?

_i_ sick of prosper and indulgence! you are quit mistaken
i do not look upon myself as either prosper or indulg i am
thwart in everi thing materi i do not consid myself at all
a fortun person

you are not quit so miser though as when you first came
go and eat and drink a littl more and you will do veri well
anoth slice of cold meat anoth draught of madeira and water
will make you nearli on a par with the rest of us

no--i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure

we are go to box hill to-morrow;--y will join us
it is not swisserland but it will be someth for a young
man so much in want of a chang you will stay and go with us?

no certainli not; i shall go home in the cool of the even

but you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morn

no--it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross

then pray stay at richmond

but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think
of you all there without me

these are difficulti which you must settl for yourself
chuse your own degre of cross i shall press you no more

the rest of the parti were now return and all were soon collect
with some there wa great joy at the sight of frank churchill;
other took it veri composedly; but there wa a veri gener distress
and disturb on miss fairfax disappear be explain
that it wa time for everi bodi to go conclud the subject; and with
a short final arrang for the next day scheme they part
frank churchil littl inclin to exclud himself increas
so much that hi last word to emma were

well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the parti i will

she smile her acceptance; and noth less than a summon from
richmond wa to take him back befor the follow even



chapter vii


they had a veri fine day for box hill; and all the other outward
circumst of arrang accommod and punctual
were in favour of a pleasant parti mr weston direct the whole
offici safe between hartfield and the vicarag and everi
bodi wa in good time emma and harriet went together; miss bate
and her niec with the eltons; the gentlemen on horseback
mr weston remain with mr woodhous noth wa want
but to be happi when they got there seven mile were travel
in expect of enjoy and everi bodi had a burst of admir
on first arriving; but in the gener amount of the day there
wa defici there wa a languor a want of spirit a want of union
which could not be got over they separ too much into parti
the elton walk together; mr knightley took charg of miss
bate and jane; and emma and harriet belong to frank churchil
and mr weston tri in vain to make them harmonis better it seem
at first an accident divis but it never materi vari
mr and mr elton inde shew no unwilling to mix
and be as agreeabl as they could; but dure the two whole hour
that were spent on the hill there seem a principl of separ
between the other parti too strong for ani fine prospect or ani
cold collat or ani cheer mr weston to remov

at first it wa downright dul to emma she had never seen frank
churchil so silent and stupid he said noth worth hearing--
look without seeing--admir without intelligence--listen without
know what she said while he wa so dull it wa no wonder that
harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insuffer

when they all sat down it wa better; to her tast a great deal better
for frank churchil grew talk and gay make her hi first object
everi distinguish attent that could be paid wa paid to her
to amus her and be agreeabl in her eye seem all that he
care for--and emma glad to be enliven not sorri to be flatter
wa gay and easi too and gave him all the friendli encourag
the admiss to be gallant which she had ever given in the first
and most anim period of their acquaintance; but which now
in her own estim meant noth though in the judgment of most
peopl look on it must have had such an appear as no english
word but flirtat could veri well describ mr frank churchil
and miss woodhous flirt togeth excess they were lay
themselv open to that veri phrase--and to have it sent off
in a letter to mapl grove by one ladi to ireland by anoth
not that emma wa gay and thoughtless from ani real felicity;
it wa rather becaus she felt less happi than she had expect
she laugh becaus she wa disappointed; and though she like him
for hi attent and thought them all whether in friendship
admir or play extrem judici they were not win
back her heart she still intend him for her friend

how much i am oblig to you said he for tell me to come to-day!--
if it had not been for you i should certainli have lost all the
happi of thi parti i had quit determin to go away again

ye you were veri cross; and i do not know what about
except that you were too late for the best strawberri
i wa a kinder friend than you deserv but you were humbl
you beg hard to be command to come

dont say i wa cross i wa fatigu the heat overcam me

it is hotter to-day

not to my feel i am perfectli comfort to-day

you are comfort becaus you are under command

your command?--y

perhap i intend you to say so but i meant self-command you had
somehow or other broken bound yesterday and run away from your
own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as i cannot
be alway with you it is best to believ your temper under your
own command rather than mine

it come to the same thing i can have no self-command without
a motiv you order me whether you speak or not and you can
be alway with me you are alway with me

date from three oclock yesterday my perpetu influenc
could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much
out of humour befor

three oclock yesterday! that is your date i thought i had seen
you first in februari

your gallantri is realli unanswer but (lower her voice)--
nobodi speak except ourselv and it is rather too much to be
talk nonsens for the entertain of seven silent peopl

i say noth of which i am asham repli he with live impud
i saw you first in februari let everi bodi on the hill hear me if
they can let my accent swell to mickleham on one side and dork
on the other i saw you first in februari and then whispering--
our companion are excess stupid what shall we do to rous them?
ani nonsens will serv they _shall_ talk ladi and gentlemen
i am order by miss woodhous (who wherev she is presides)
to say that she desir to know what you are all think of?

some laugh and answer good-humouredli miss bate said a great deal;
mr elton swell at the idea of miss woodhous presiding;
mr knightley answer wa the most distinct

is miss woodhous sure that she would like to hear what we are
all think of?

oh! no no--cri emma laugh as carelessli as she could--
upon no account in the world it is the veri last thing i
would stand the brunt of just now let me hear ani thing rather
than what you are all think of i will not say quit all
there are one or two perhap (glanc at mr weston and harriet)
whose thought i might not be afraid of know

it is a sort of thing cri mr elton emphat
which _i_ should not have thought myself privileg to
inquir into though perhap as the _chaperon_ of the party--
_i_ never wa in ani circle--explor parties--young ladies--marri women--

her mutter were chiefli to her husband; and he murmur
in repli

veri true my love veri true exactli so indeed--quit unheard of--
but some ladi say ani thing better pass it off as a joke
everi bodi know what is due to _you_

it will not do whisper frank to emma; they are most
of them affront i will attack them with more address
ladi and gentlemen--i am order by miss woodhous to say that she
waiv her right of know exactli what you may all be think of
and onli requir someth veri entertain from each of you
in a gener way here are seven of you besid myself (who she
is pleas to say am veri entertain already) and she onli
demand from each of you either one thing veri clever be it prose
or vers origin or repeated--or two thing moder clever--
or three thing veri dull inde and she engag to laugh heartili
at them all

oh! veri well exclaim miss bate then i need not be uneasi
`three thing veri dull inde that will just do for me you know
i shall be sure to say three dull thing as soon as ever i open
my mouth shant i? (look round with the most good-humour
depend on everi bodi assent)--do not you all think i shall?

emma could not resist

ah! maam but there may be a difficulti pardon me--but you
will be limit as to number--onli three at onc

miss bate deceiv by the mock ceremoni of her manner did not
immedi catch her meaning; but when it burst on her it could
not anger though a slight blush shew that it could pain her

ah!--well--to be sure ye i see what she mean (turn to
mr knightley) and i will tri to hold my tongu i must make
myself veri disagre or she would not have said such a thing
to an old friend

i like your plan cri mr weston agre agre i will do
my best i am make a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon?

low i am afraid sir veri low answer hi son;--but we shall
be indulgent--especi to ani one who lead the way

no no said emma it will not reckon low a conundrum of
mr weston shall clear him and hi next neighbour come sir
pray let me hear it

i doubt it be veri clever myself said mr weston
it is too much a matter of fact but here it is--what two letter
of the alphabet are there that express perfection?

what two letters!--express perfection! i am sure i do not know

ah! you will never guess you (to emma) i am certain will
never guess--i will tell you--m and a--em-ma--do you understand?

understand and gratif came togeth it might be a veri
indiffer piec of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh
at and enjoy in it--and so did frank and harriet--it did not seem
to touch the rest of the parti equally; some look veri stupid
about it and mr knightley grave said

thi explain the sort of clever thing that is want and mr weston
ha done veri well for himself; but he must have knock up everi
bodi els _perfection_ should not have come quit so soon

oh! for myself i protest i must be excus said mr elton;
_i_ realli cannot attempt--i am not at all fond of the sort of thing
i had an acrost onc sent to me upon my own name which i wa not
at all pleas with i knew who it came from an abomin puppy!--
you know who i mean (nod to her husband) these kind of thing
are veri well at christma when one is sit round the fire;
but quit out of place in my opinion when one is explor
about the countri in summer miss woodhous must excus me
i am not one of those who have witti thing at everi bodi servic
i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivac
in my own way but i realli must be allow to judg when to speak
and when to hold my tongu pass us if you pleas mr churchil
pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have noth clever to say--
not one of us

ye ye pray pass _me_ ad her husband with a sort of
sneer consciousness; _i_ have noth to say that can entertain
miss woodhous or ani other young ladi an old marri man--
quit good for noth shall we walk augusta?

with all my heart i am realli tire of explor so long
on one spot come jane take my other arm

jane declin it howev and the husband and wife walk off
happi couple! said frank churchil as soon as they were out
of hearing:--how well they suit one another!--veri lucky--marri as
they did upon an acquaint form onli in a public place!--they onli
knew each other i think a few week in bath! peculiarli lucky!--
for as to ani real knowledg of a person disposit that bath
or ani public place can give--it is all nothing; there can be
no knowledg it is onli by see women in their own home
among their own set just as they alway are that you can form
ani just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck--
and will gener be ill-luck how mani a man ha commit himself
on a short acquaint and ru it all the rest of hi life!

miss fairfax who had seldom spoken befor except among her
own confeder spoke now

such thing do occur undoubtedly--sh wa stop by a cough
frank churchil turn toward her to listen

you were speak said he grave she recov her voic

i wa onli go to observ that though such unfortun circumst
do sometim occur both to men and women i cannot imagin them
to be veri frequent a hasti and imprud attach may arise--
but there is gener time to recov from it afterward i would
be understood to mean that it can be onli weak irresolut charact
(whose happi must be alway at the merci of chance)
who will suffer an unfortun acquaint to be an inconveni
an oppress for ever

he made no answer; mere look and bow in submission; and soon
afterward said in a live tone

well i have so littl confid in my own judgment that whenev
i marri i hope some bodi will chuse my wife for me will you?
(turn to emma) will you chuse a wife for me?--i am sure i
should like ani bodi fix on by you you provid for the famili
you know (with a smile at hi father) find some bodi for me
i am in no hurri adopt her educ her

and make her like myself

by all mean if you can

veri well i undertak the commiss you shall have a charm wife

she must be veri live and have hazl eye i care for noth els
i shall go abroad for a coupl of years--and when i return
i shall come to you for my wife rememb

emma wa in no danger of forget it wa a commiss to touch everi
favourit feel would not harriet be the veri creatur described?
hazl eye except two year more might make her all that he wish
he might even have harriet in hi thought at the moment;
who could say? refer the educ to her seem to impli it

now maam said jane to her aunt shall we join mr elton?

if you pleas my dear with all my heart i am quit readi
i wa readi to have gone with her but thi will do just as well
we shall soon overtak her there she is--no that somebodi els
that one of the ladi in the irish car parti not at all like her--
well i declare--

they walk off follow in half a minut by mr knightley
mr weston hi son emma and harriet onli remained; and the young
man spirit now rose to a pitch almost unpleas even emma grew
tire at last of flatteri and merriment and wish herself rather
walk quietli about with ani of the other or sit almost alon
and quit unattend to in tranquil observ of the beauti
view beneath her the appear of the servant look out
for them to give notic of the carriag wa a joy sight;
and even the bustl of collect and prepar to depart
and the solicitud of mr elton to have _her_ carriag first
were gladli endur in the prospect of the quiet drive home which wa
to close the veri question enjoy of thi day of pleasur
such anoth scheme compos of so mani ill-assort peopl
she hope never to be betray into again

while wait for the carriag she found mr knightley by her side
he look around as if to see that no one were near and then said

emma i must onc more speak to you as i have been use to do:
a privileg rather endur than allow perhap but i must still
use it i cannot see you act wrong without a remonstr
how could you be so unfeel to miss bates? how could you be so
insol in your wit to a woman of her charact age and situation?--
emma i had not thought it possibl

emma recollect blush wa sorri but tri to laugh it off

nay how could i help say what i did?--nobodi could have help it
it wa not so veri bad i dare say she did not understand me

i assur you she did she felt your full mean she ha talk
of it sinc i wish you could have heard how she talk of it--
with what candour and generos i wish you could have heard her
honour your forbear in be abl to pay her such attent
as she wa for ever receiv from yourself and your father
when her societi must be so irksom

oh! cri emma i know there is not a better creatur in the world:
but you must allow that what is good and what is ridicul are
most unfortun blend in her

they are blend said he i acknowledge; and were she prosper
i could allow much for the occasion preval of the ridicul
over the good were she a woman of fortun i would leav everi
harmless absurd to take it chanc i would not quarrel with you
for ani liberti of manner were she your equal in situation--
but emma consid how far thi is from be the case she is poor;
she ha sunk from the comfort she wa born to; and if she live
to old age must probabl sink more her situat should secur
your compass it wa badli done indeed! you whom she had known
from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her
notic wa an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirit
and the pride of the moment laugh at her humbl her--and befor
her niec too--and befor other mani of whom (certainli _some_)
would be entir guid by _your_ treatment of her--thi is not
pleasant to you emma--and it is veri far from pleasant to me;
but i must i will--i will tell you truth while i can;
satisfi with prove myself your friend by veri faith counsel
and trust that you will some time or other do me greater justic
than you can do now

while they talk they were advanc toward the carriage;
it wa ready; and befor she could speak again he had hand her in
he had misinterpret the feel which had kept her face avert
and her tongu motionless they were combin onli of anger
against herself mortif and deep concern she had not
been abl to speak; and on enter the carriag sunk back
for a moment overcome--then reproach herself for have taken
no leav make no acknowledg part in appar sullen
she look out with voic and hand eager to shew a difference;
but it wa just too late he had turn away and the hors were
in motion she continu to look back but in vain; and soon
with what appear unusu speed they were half way down the hill
and everi thing left far behind she wa vex beyond what could
have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal
never had she felt so agit mortifi griev at ani circumst
in her life she wa most forcibl struck the truth of thi
represent there wa no deni she felt it at her heart
how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates! how could
she have expos herself to such ill opinion in ani one she valued!
and how suffer him to leav her without say one word of gratitud
of concurr of common kindness!

time did not compos her as she reflect more she seem
but to feel it more she never had been so depress happili it
wa not necessari to speak there wa onli harriet who seem not
in spirit herself fag and veri will to be silent; and emma
felt the tear run down her cheek almost all the way home
without be at ani troubl to check them extraordinari as they were



chapter viii


the wretched of a scheme to box hill wa in emma thought all
the even how it might be consid by the rest of the parti
she could not tell they in their differ home and their differ
way might be look back on it with pleasure; but in her view it
wa a morn more complet misspent more total bare of ration
satisfact at the time and more to be abhor in recollect
than ani she had ever pass a whole even of back-gammon with
her father wa felic to it _there_ inde lay real pleasur
for there she wa give up the sweetest hour of the twenty-four
to hi comfort; and feel that unmerit as might be the degre
of hi fond affect and confid esteem she could not in her
gener conduct be open to ani sever reproach as a daughter
she hope she wa not without a heart she hope no one could
have said to her how could you be so unfeel to your father?--
i must i will tell you truth while i can miss bate should
never again--no never! if attent in futur could do away
the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss
her conscienc told her so; remiss perhap more in thought
than fact; scorn ungraci but it should be so no more
in the warmth of true contrit she would call upon her the
veri next morn and it should be the begin on her side
of a regular equal kindli intercours

she wa just as determin when the morrow came and went earli
that noth might prevent her it wa not unlik she thought
that she might see mr knightley in her way; or perhap he might
come in while she were pay her visit she had no object
she would not be asham of the appear of the penit so justli
and truli her her eye were toward donwel as she walk but she
saw him not

the ladi were all at home she had never rejoic at the sound
befor nor ever befor enter the passag nor walk up the stair
with ani wish of give pleasur but in confer oblig
or of deriv it except in subsequ ridicul

there wa a bustl on her approach; a good deal of move and talk
she heard miss batess voic someth wa to be done in a hurry;
the maid look frighten and awkward; hope she would be pleas
to wait a moment and then usher her in too soon the aunt and
niec seem both escap into the adjoin room jane she had
a distinct glimps of look extrem ill; and befor the door
had shut them out she heard miss bate say well my dear
i shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are
ill enough

poor old mr bate civil and humbl as usual look as if she
did not quit understand what wa go on

i am afraid jane is not veri well said she but i do not know;
they _tell_ me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here present
miss woodhous i hope you find a chair i wish hetti had not gone
i am veri littl able--hav you a chair maam? do you sit where
you like? i am sure she will be here present

emma serious hope she would she had a moment fear of miss
bate keep away from her but miss bate soon came--veri happi
and obliged--but emma conscienc told her that there wa not the
same cheer volubl as before--less eas of look and manner
a veri friendli inquiri after miss fairfax she hope might lead
the way to a return of old feel the touch seem immedi

ah! miss woodhous how kind you are!--i suppos you have heard--
and are come to give us joy thi doe not seem much like joy
inde in me--(twinkl away a tear or two)--but it will be
veri tri for us to part with her after have had her so long
and she ha a dread headach just now write all the morning:--
such long letter you know to be written to colonel campbel
and mr dixon `mi dear said i `you will blind yourself--
for tear were in her eye perpetu one cannot wonder
one cannot wonder it is a great change; and though she is
amazingli fortunate--such a situat i suppos as no young woman
befor ever met with on first go out--do not think us ungrat
miss woodhous for such surpris good fortune--(again dispers
her tears)--but poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headach
she ha when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel
ani bless quit as it may deserv she is as low as possibl
to look at her nobodi would think how delight and happi she
is to have secur such a situat you will excus her not
come to you--sh is not able--sh is gone into her own room--
i want her to lie down upon the bed `mi dear said i `i shall
say you are laid down upon the bed: but howev she is not;
she is walk about the room but now that she ha written
her letter she say she shall soon be well she will be extrem
sorri to miss see you miss woodhous but your kind will
excus her you were kept wait at the door--i wa quit ashamed--
but somehow there wa a littl bustle--for it so happen that we
had not heard the knock and till you were on the stair we did
not know ani bodi wa come `it is onli mr cole said i
`depend upon it nobodi els would come so earli `well said she
`it must be born some time or other and it may as well be now
but then patti came in and said it wa you `oh! said i
`it is miss woodhouse: i am sure you will like to see her--
`i can see nobodi said she; and up she got and would go away;
and that wa what made us keep you waiting--and extrem sorri
and asham we were `if you must go my dear said i `you must
and i will say you are laid down upon the bed

emma wa most sincer interest her heart had been long grow
kinder toward jane; and thi pictur of her present suffer act
as a cure of everi former ungener suspicion and left her noth
but pity; and the remembr of the less just and less gentl
sensat of the past oblig her to admit that jane might veri
natur resolv on see mr cole or ani other steadi friend
when she might not bear to see herself she spoke as she felt
with earnest regret and solicitude--sincer wish that the
circumst which she collect from miss bate to be now actual
determin on might be as much for miss fairfax advantag
and comfort as possibl it must be a sever trial to them all
she had understood it wa to be delay till colonel campbel return

so veri kind! repli miss bate but you are alway kind

there wa no bear such an always; and to break through her
dread gratitud emma made the direct inquiri of--

where--may i ask?--i miss fairfax going?

to a mr smallridge--charm woman--most superior--to have
the charg of her three littl girls--delight children
imposs that ani situat could be more replet with comfort;
if we except perhap mr suckl own famili and mr bragges;
but mr smallridg is intim with both and in the veri
same neighbourhood:--l onli four mile from mapl grove
jane will be onli four mile from mapl grove

mr elton i suppos ha been the person to whom miss fairfax owes--

ye our good mr elton the most indefatig true friend
she would not take a denial she would not let jane say `no; for
when jane first heard of it (it wa the day befor yesterday
the veri morn we were at donwell) when jane first heard of it
she wa quit decid against accept the offer and for the
reason you mention; exactli as you say she had made up her mind
to close with noth till colonel campbel return and noth
should induc her to enter into ani engag at present--and so she
told mr elton over and over again--and i am sure i had no more
idea that she would chang her mind!--but that good mr elton
whose judgment never fail her saw farther than i did it is not
everi bodi that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did
and refus to take jane answer; but she posit declar she
would _not_ write ani such denial yesterday as jane wish her;
she would wait--and sure enough yesterday even it wa all
settl that jane should go quit a surpriz to me! i had not
the least idea!--jan took mr elton asid and told her at onc
that upon think over the advantag of mr smallridg situat
she had come to the resolut of accept it--i did not know a word
of it till it wa all settl

you spent the even with mr elton?

ye all of us; mr elton would have us come it wa settl so
upon the hill while we were walk about with mr knightley
`you _must_ _all_ spend your even with us said she--`i posit must
have you _all_ come

mr knightley wa there too wa he?

no not mr knightley; he declin it from the first; and though i
thought he would come becaus mr elton declar she would not let
him off he did not;--but my mother and jane and i were all there
and a veri agreeabl even we had such kind friend you know
miss woodhous one must alway find agreeabl though everi bodi
seem rather fag after the morn parti even pleasur
you know is fatiguing--and i cannot say that ani of them seem
veri much to have enjoy it howev _i_ shall alway think it
a veri pleasant parti and feel extrem oblig to the kind friend
who includ me in it

miss fairfax i suppos though you were not awar of it had been
make up her mind the whole day?

i dare say she had

whenev the time may come it must be unwelcom to her and all
her friends--but i hope her engag will have everi allevi
that is possible--i mean as to the charact and manner of the famili

thank you dear miss woodhous ye inde there is everi thing
in the world that can make her happi in it except the suckl
and bragg there is not such anoth nurseri establish
so liber and eleg in all mr elton acquaint
mr smallridg a most delight woman!--a style of live almost
equal to mapl grove--and as to the children except the littl
suckl and littl bragg there are not such eleg sweet
children anywher jane will be treat with such regard and kindness!--
it will be noth but pleasur a life of pleasure--and her salary!--
i realli cannot ventur to name her salari to you miss woodhous
even you use as you are to great sum would hardli believ that
so much could be given to a young person like jane

ah! madam cri emma if other children are at all like what i
rememb to have been myself i should think five time the amount
of what i have ever yet heard name as a salari on such occas
dearli earn

you are so nobl in your ideas!

and when is miss fairfax to leav you?

veri soon veri soon indeed; that the worst of it
within a fortnight mr smallridg is in a great hurri my poor
mother doe not know how to bear it so then i tri to put it out of
her thought and say come maam do not let us think about it ani more

her friend must all be sorri to lose her; and will not colonel
and mr campbel be sorri to find that she ha engag herself
befor their return?

yes; jane say she is sure they will; but yet thi is such
a situat as she cannot feel herself justifi in declin
i wa so astonish when she first told me what she had been say
to mr elton and when mr elton at the same moment came congratul
me upon it! it wa befor tea--stay--no it could not be befor tea
becaus we were just go to cards--and yet it wa befor tea
becaus i rememb thinking--oh! no now i recollect now i have it;
someth happen befor tea but not that mr elton wa call
out of the room befor tea old john abdi son want to speak
with him poor old john i have a great regard for him; he wa clerk
to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now poor old man he is
bed-ridden and veri poorli with the rheumat gout in hi joints--
i must go and see him to-day; and so will jane i am sure if she
get out at all and poor john son came to talk to mr elton
about relief from the parish; he is veri well to do himself
you know be head man at the crown ostler and everi thing
of that sort but still he cannot keep hi father without some help;
and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler
had been tell him and then it came out about the chais have
been sent to randal to take mr frank churchil to richmond
that wa what happen befor tea it wa after tea that jane spoke
to mr elton

miss bate would hardli give emma time to say how perfectli
new thi circumst wa to her; but as without suppos it
possibl that she could be ignor of ani of the particular
of mr frank churchil go she proceed to give them all
it wa of no consequ

what mr elton had learn from the ostler on the subject be the
accumul of the ostler own knowledg and the knowledg
of the servant at randal wa that a messeng had come over
from richmond soon after the return of the parti from box hill--
which messeng howev had been no more than wa expected;
and that mr churchil had sent hi nephew a few line contain
upon the whole a toler account of mr churchil and onli
wish him not to delay come back beyond the next morn early;
but that mr frank churchil have resolv to go home directli
without wait at all and hi hors seem to have got a cold
tom had been sent off immedi for the crown chais and the
ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy go a good pace
and drive veri steadi

there wa noth in all thi either to astonish or interest
and it caught emma attent onli as it unit with the subject
which alreadi engag her mind the contrast between mr churchil
import in the world and jane fairfax struck her; one wa
everi thing the other nothing--and she sat muse on the differ
of woman destini and quit unconsci on what her eye were fix
till rous by miss batess say

aye i see what you are think of the pianofort what is to becom
of that?--veri true poor dear jane wa talk of it just now--
`you must go said she `you and i must part you will have no
busi here--let it stay howev said she; `give it houseroom
till colonel campbel come back i shall talk about it to him;
he will settl for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties--
and to thi day i do believ she know not whether it wa hi
present or hi daughter

now emma wa oblig to think of the pianoforte; and the remembr
of all her former fanci and unfair conjectur wa so littl pleas
that she soon allow herself to believ her visit had been
long enough; and with a repetit of everi thing that she could
ventur to say of the good wish which she realli felt took leav



chapter ix


emma pensiv medit as she walk home were not interrupted;
but on enter the parlour she found those who must rous her
mr knightley and harriet had arriv dure her absenc and were
sit with her father--mr knightley immedi got up and in a
manner decidedli graver than usual said

i would not go away without see you but i have no time to spare
and therefor must now be gone directli i am go to london
to spend a few day with john and isabella have you ani thing to
send or say besid the `love which nobodi carries?

noth at all but is not thi a sudden scheme?

yes--rather--i have been think of it some littl time

emma wa sure he had not forgiven her; he look unlik himself
time howev she thought would tell him that they ought to be
friend again while he stood as if mean to go but not going--
her father began hi inquiri

well my dear and did you get there safely?--and how did you
find my worthi old friend and her daughter?--i dare say they must
have been veri much oblig to you for come dear emma ha been
to call on mr and miss bate mr knightley as i told you befor
she is alway so attent to them!

emma colour wa heighten by thi unjust praise; and with a smile
and shake of the head which spoke much she look at mr knightley--
it seem as if there were an instantan impress in her favour
as if hi eye receiv the truth from her and all that had
pass of good in her feel were at onc caught and honoured--
he look at her with a glow of regard she wa warmli gratified--
and in anoth moment still more so by a littl movement of
more than common friendli on hi part--h took her hand;--
whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say--
she might perhap have rather offer it--but he took her hand
press it and certainli wa on the point of carri it to hi lips--
when from some fanci or other he suddenli let it go--whi he should feel
such a scrupl whi he should chang hi mind when it wa all but done
she could not perceive--h would have judg better she thought
if he had not stopped--th intent howev wa indubitable;
and whether it wa that hi manner had in gener so littl gallantri
or howev els it happen but she thought noth becam him more--
it wa with him of so simpl yet so dignifi a nature--
she could not but recal the attempt with great satisfact
it spoke such perfect amity--h left them immedi afterwards--
gone in a moment he alway move with the alert of a mind which
could neither be undecid nor dilatori but now he seem more sudden
than usual in hi disappear

emma could not regret her have gone to miss bate but she wish
she had left her ten minut earlier;--it would have been a great
pleasur to talk over jane fairfax situat with mr knightley--
neither would she regret that he should be go to brunswick squar
for she knew how much hi visit would be enjoyed--but it might have
happen at a better time--and to have had longer notic of it
would have been pleasanter--they part thorough friend however;
she could not be deceiv as to the mean of hi counten
and hi unfinish gallantry;--it wa all done to assur her that she
had fulli recov hi good opinion--h had been sit with them
half an hour she found it wa a piti that she had not come
back earlier!

in the hope of divert her father thought from the disagre
of mr knightley go to london; and go so suddenly;
and go on horseback which she knew would be all veri bad;
emma commun her news of jane fairfax and her depend
on the effect wa justified; it suppli a veri use check--
interest without disturb him he had long made up hi mind to jane
fairfax go out as gover and could talk of it cheer
but mr knightley go to london had been an unexpect blow

i am veri glad inde my dear to hear she is to be so
comfort settl mr elton is veri good-natur and agreeabl
and i dare say her acquaint are just what they ought
to be i hope it is a dri situat and that her health
will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object
as i am sure poor miss taylor alway wa with me you know
my dear she is go to be to thi new ladi what miss taylor
wa to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect
and not be induc to go away after it ha been her home so long

the follow day brought news from richmond to throw everi
thing els into the background an express arriv at randal
to announc the death of mr churchill! though her nephew
had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account
she had not live abov six-and-thirti hour after hi return
a sudden seizur of a differ natur from ani thing forebod
by her gener state had carri her off after a short struggl
the great mr churchil wa no more

it wa felt as such thing must be felt everi bodi had a
degre of graviti and sorrow; tender toward the depart
solicitud for the surviv friends; and in a reason time
curios to know where she would be buri goldsmith tell us
that when love woman stoop to folli she ha noth to do
but to die; and when she stoop to be disagre it is equal
to be recommend as a clearer of ill-fam mr churchil
after be dislik at least twenty-f year wa now spoken of
with compassion allow in one point she wa fulli justifi
she had never been admit befor to be serious ill the event
acquit her of all the fanci and all the selfish
of imaginari complaint

poor mr churchill! no doubt she had been suffer a great deal:
more than ani bodi had ever supposed--and continu pain would tri
the temper it wa a sad event--a great shock--with all her fault
what would mr churchil do without her? mr churchil loss
would be dread inde mr churchil would never get over it--
even mr weston shook hi head and look solemn and said
ah! poor woman who would have thought it! and resolv that hi
mourn should be as handsom as possible; and hi wife sat sigh
and moralis over her broad hem with a commiser and good sens
true and steadi how it would affect frank wa among the earliest
thought of both it wa also a veri earli specul with emma
the charact of mr churchil the grief of her husband--h mind
glanc over them both with awe and compassion--and then rest
with lighten feel on how frank might be affect by the event
how benefit how freed she saw in a moment all the possibl good
now an attach to harriet smith would have noth to encount
mr churchil independ of hi wife wa fear by nobody;
an easi guidabl man to be persuad into ani thing by hi nephew
all that remain to be wish wa that the nephew should form
the attach as with all her goodwil in the caus emma could feel
no certainti of it be alreadi form

harriet behav extrem well on the occas with great self-command
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betray noth emma wa
gratifi to observ such a proof in her of strengthen charact
and refrain from ani allus that might endang it mainten
they spoke therefor of mr churchil death with mutual forbear

short letter from frank were receiv at randal commun
all that wa immedi import of their state and plan
mr churchil wa better than could be expected; and their
first remov on the departur of the funer for yorkshir
wa to be to the hous of a veri old friend in windsor to whom
mr churchil had been promis a visit the last ten year
at present there wa noth to be done for harriet; good wish
for the futur were all that could yet be possibl on emma side

it wa a more press concern to shew attent to jane fairfax
whose prospect were close while harriet open and whose
engag now allow of no delay in ani one at highburi who wish
to shew her kindness--and with emma it wa grown into a first wish
she had scarc a stronger regret than for her past coldness;
and the person whom she had been so mani month neglect wa now
the veri one on whom she would have lavish everi distinct of
regard or sympathi she want to be of use to her; want to shew
a valu for her societi and testifi respect and consider
she resolv to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield
a note wa written to urg it the invit wa refus and by
a verbal messag miss fairfax wa not well enough to write;
and when mr perri call at hartfield the same morn
it appear that she wa so much indispos as to have been visit
though against her own consent by himself and that she wa suffer
under sever headach and a nervou fever to a degre which made
him doubt the possibl of her go to mr smallridg at the
time propos her health seem for the moment complet deranged--
appetit quit gone--and though there were no absolut
alarm symptom noth touch the pulmonari complaint
which wa the stand apprehens of the famili mr perri wa
uneasi about her he thought she had undertaken more than she
wa equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would
not own it her spirit seem overcom her present home
he could not but observ wa unfavour to a nervou disorder:--
confin alway to one room;--h could have wish it otherwise--
and her good aunt though hi veri old friend he must acknowledg
to be not the best companion for an invalid of that descript
her care and attent could not be questioned; they were in fact
onli too great he veri much fear that miss fairfax deriv more
evil than good from them emma listen with the warmest concern;
griev for her more and more and look around eager to discov
some way of be use to take her--b it onli an hour
or two--from her aunt to give her chang of air and scene
and quiet ration convers even for an hour or two
might do her good; and the follow morn she wrote again to say
in the most feel languag she could command that she would
call for her in the carriag at ani hour that jane would name--
mention that she had mr perri decid opinion in favour
of such exercis for hi patient the answer wa onli in thi
short note:

miss fairfax compliment and thank but is quit unequ
to ani exercis

emma felt that her own note had deserv someth better; but it
wa imposs to quarrel with word whose tremul inequ
shew indisposit so plainli and she thought onli of how she
might best counteract thi unwilling to be seen or assist
in spite of the answer therefor she order the carriag and drove
to mr batess in the hope that jane would be induc to join her--
but it would not do;--miss bate came to the carriag door all gratitud
and agre with her most earnestli in think an air might be of
the greatest service--and everi thing that messag could do wa tried--
but all in vain miss bate wa oblig to return without success;
jane wa quit unpersuadable; the mere propos of go out
seem to make her worse--emma wish she could have seen her
and tri her own powers; but almost befor she could hint the wish
miss bate made it appear that she had promis her niec on
no account to let miss woodhous in inde the truth wa
that poor dear jane could not bear to see ani body--ani bodi at all--
mr elton inde could not be denied--and mr cole had made
such a point--and mr perri had said so much--but except them
jane would realli see nobodi

emma did not want to be class with the mr elton the mr perri
and the mr cole who would forc themselv anywhere;
neither could she feel ani right of prefer herself--
she submit therefor and onli question miss bate farther
as to her niec appetit and diet which she long to be abl
to assist on that subject poor miss bate wa veri unhappi
and veri communicative; jane would hardli eat ani thing:--
mr perri recommend nourish food; but everi thing they could
command (and never had ani bodi such good neighbours) wa distast

emma on reach home call the housekeep directli to an
examin of her stores; and some arrowroot of veri superior qualiti
wa speedili despatch to miss bate with a most friendli note
in half an hour the arrowroot wa return with a thousand thank
from miss bate but dear jane would not be satisfi without it
be sent back; it wa a thing she could not take--and moreov
she insist on her say that she wa not at all in want of ani thing

when emma afterward heard that jane fairfax had been seen wander
about the meadow at some distanc from highburi on the afternoon
of the veri day on which she had under the plea of be unequ
to ani exercis so peremptorili refus to go out with her in
the carriag she could have no doubt--put everi thing together--
that jane wa resolv to receiv no kind from _her_ she wa sorri
veri sorri her heart wa griev for a state which seem
but the more pitiabl from thi sort of irrit of spirit
inconsist of action and inequ of powers; and it mortifi
her that she wa given so littl credit for proper feel or esteem
so littl worthi as a friend: but she had the consol of know
that her intent were good and of be abl to say to herself
that could mr knightley have been privi to all her attempt
of assist jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart
he would not on thi occas have found ani thing to reprov



chapter x


one morn about ten day after mr churchil deceas
emma wa call downstair to mr weston who could not stay
five minut and want particularli to speak with her--
he met her at the parlour-door and hardli ask her how she did
in the natur key of hi voic sunk it immedi to say
unheard by her father

can you come to randal at ani time thi morning?--do if it
be possibl mr weston want to see you she must see you

is she unwell?

no no not at all--onli a littl agit she would have
order the carriag and come to you but she must see you _alone_
and that you know--(nod toward her father)--humph!--can you come?

certainli thi moment if you pleas it is imposs to
refus what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter?--
is she realli not ill?

depend upon me--but ask no more question you will know it
all in time the most unaccount business! but hush hush!

to guess what all thi meant wa imposs even for emma
someth realli import seem announc by hi looks;
but as her friend wa well she endeavour not to be uneasi
and settl it with her father that she would take her walk now
she and mr weston were soon out of the hous togeth and on
their way at a quick pace for randal

now--said emma when they were fairli beyond the sweep gates--
now mr weston do let me know what ha happen

no no--h grave replied--dont ask me i promis my wife
to leav it all to her she will break it to you better than i can
do not be impati emma; it will all come out too soon

break it to me cri emma stand still with terror--
good god!--mr weston tell me at once--someth ha happen
in brunswick squar i know it ha tell me i charg you tell
me thi moment what it is

no inde you are mistaken--

mr weston do not trifl with me--consid how mani of my dearest
friend are now in brunswick squar which of them is it?--
i charg you by all that is sacr not to attempt conceal

upon my word emma--

your word!--whi not your honour!--whi not say upon your honour
that it ha noth to do with ani of them? good heavens!--what can
be to be _broke_ to me that doe not relat to one of that family?

upon my honour said he veri serious it doe not it is not
in the smallest degre connect with ani human be of the name
of knightley

emma courag return and she walk on

i wa wrong he continu in talk of it be _broke_ to you
i should not have use the express in fact it doe not concern you--
it concern onli myself--that is we hope--humph!--in short
my dear emma there is no occas to be so uneasi about it
i dont say that it is not a disagre business--but thing might
be much worse--if we walk fast we shall soon be at randal

emma found that she must wait; and now it requir littl effort
she ask no more question therefor mere employ her own fanci
and that soon point out to her the probabl of it be some
money concern--someth just come to light of a disagre
natur in the circumst of the family--someth which the late
event at richmond had brought forward her fanci wa veri activ
half a dozen natur children perhaps--and poor frank cut off!--
thi though veri undesir would be no matter of agoni to her
it inspir littl more than an anim curios

who is that gentleman on horseback? said she as they proceeded--
speak more to assist mr weston in keep hi secret than with
ani other view

i do not know--on of the otways--not frank;--it is not frank
i assur you you will not see him he is half way to windsor
by thi time

ha your son been with you then?

oh! yes--did not you know?--wel well never mind

for a moment he wa silent; and then ad in a tone much more
guard and demur

ye frank came over thi morn just to ask us how we did

they hurri on and were speedili at randalls--wel my dear
said he as they enter the room--i have brought her and now
i hope you will soon be better i shall leav you togeth
there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me--
and emma distinctli heard him add in a lower tone befor he
quit the room--i have been as good as my word she ha not the
least idea

mr weston wa look so ill and had an air of so much perturb
that emma uneasi increased; and the moment they were alon
she eagerli said

what is it my dear friend? someth of a veri unpleas natur
i find ha occurred;--do let me know directli what it is
i have been walk all thi way in complet suspens we both
abhor suspens do not let mine continu longer it will do you
good to speak of your distress whatev it may be

have you inde no idea? said mr weston in a trembl voic
cannot you my dear emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you
are to hear?

so far as that it relat to mr frank churchil i do guess

you are right it doe relat to him and i will tell you directly;
(resum her work and seem resolv against look up)
he ha been here thi veri morn on a most extraordinari errand
it is imposs to express our surpriz he came to speak to hi
father on a subject--to announc an attachment--

she stop to breath emma thought first of herself and then
of harriet

more than an attach inde resum mr weston; an engagement--
a posit engagement--what will you say emma--what will ani
bodi say when it is known that frank churchil and miss fairfax
are engaged;--nay that they have been long engaged!

emma even jump with surprize;--and horror-struck exclaim

jane fairfax!--good god! you are not serious? you do not mean it?

you may well be amaz return mr weston still avert her eye
and talk on with eager that emma might have time to recover--
you may well be amaz but it is even so there ha been a solemn
engag between them ever sinc october--form at weymouth
and kept a secret from everi bodi not a creatur know it
but themselves--neith the campbel nor her famili nor his--
it is so wonder that though perfectli convinc of the fact
it is yet almost incred to myself i can hardli believ it--
i thought i knew him

emma scarc heard what wa said--her mind wa divid between
two ideas--h own former convers with him about miss fairfax;
and poor harriet;--and for some time she could onli exclaim
and requir confirm repeat confirm

well said she at last tri to recov herself; thi is a
circumst which i must think of at least half a day befor i
can at all comprehend it what!--engag to her all the winter--
befor either of them came to highbury?

engag sinc october--secretli engaged--it ha hurt me
emma veri much it ha hurt hi father equal _some_ _part_
of hi conduct we cannot excus

emma ponder a moment and then repli i will not pretend
_not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power
be assur that no such effect ha follow hi attent to me
as you are apprehens of

mr weston look up afraid to believe; but emma counten
wa as steadi as her word

that you may have less difficulti in believ thi boast of my
present perfect indiffer she continu i will farther tell you
that there wa a period in the earli part of our acquaint
when i did like him when i wa veri much dispos to be
attach to him--nay wa attached--and how it came to ceas
is perhap the wonder fortun howev it did ceas
i have realli for some time past for at least these three month
care noth about him you may believ me mr weston
thi is the simpl truth

mr weston kiss her with tear of joy; and when she could
find utter assur her that thi protest had done
her more good than ani thing els in the world could do

mr weston will be almost as much reliev as myself said she
on thi point we have been wretch it wa our darl wish that you
might be attach to each other--and we were persuad that it wa so--
imagin what we have been feel on your account

i have escaped; and that i should escap may be a matter of
grate wonder to you and myself but thi doe not acquit _him_
mr weston; and i must say that i think him greatli to blame
what right had he to come among us with affect and faith engag
and with manner so _very_ disengaged? what right had he to endeavour
to pleas as he certainli did--to distinguish ani one young woman with
persev attent as he certainli did--whil he realli belong
to another?--how could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--
how could he tell that he might not be make me in love with him?--
veri wrong veri wrong inde

from someth that he said my dear emma i rather imagine--

and how could _she_ bear such behaviour! composur with a witness!
to look on while repeat attent were offer to anoth woman
befor her face and not resent it--that is a degre of placid
which i can neither comprehend nor respect

there were misunderstand between them emma; he said
so expressli he had not time to enter into much explan
he wa here onli a quarter of an hour and in a state of agit
which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--
but that there had been misunderstand he decidedli said
the present crisi inde seem to be brought on by them;
and those misunderstand might veri possibl aris from the
improprieti of hi conduct

impropriety! oh! mr weston--it is too calm a censur
much much beyond impropriety!--it ha sunk him i cannot say how
it ha sunk him in my opinion so unlik what a man should be!--
none of that upright integr that strict adher to truth
and principl that disdain of trick and littl which a man
should display in everi transact of hi life

nay dear emma now i must take hi part; for though he ha been
wrong in thi instanc i have known him long enough to answer
for hi have mani veri mani good qualities; and--

good god! cri emma not attend to her--mr smallridg too!
jane actual on the point of go as governess! what could he
mean by such horribl indelicacy? to suffer her to engag herself--
to suffer her even to think of such a measure!

he knew noth about it emma on thi articl i can fulli
acquit him it wa a privat resolut of her not commun
to him--or at least not commun in a way to carri conviction--
till yesterday i know he said he wa in the dark as to her plan
they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message--
and it wa the discoveri of what she wa do of thi veri project
of her which determin him to come forward at onc own it
all to hi uncl throw himself on hi kind and in short
put an end to the miser state of conceal that had been
carri on so long

emma began to listen better

i am to hear from him soon continu mr weston he told me
at part that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which
seem to promis me mani particular that could not be given now
let us wait therefor for thi letter it may bring mani extenu
it may make mani thing intellig and excus which now are
not to be understood dont let us be sever dont let us be in
a hurri to condemn him let us have patienc i must love him;
and now that i am satisfi on one point the one materi point
i am sincer anxiou for it all turn out well and readi
to hope that it may they must both have suffer a great deal
under such a system of secresi and conceal

_his_ suffer repli emma dryli do not appear to have done
him much harm well and how did mr churchil take it?

most favour for hi nephew--gav hi consent with scarc
a difficulti conceiv what the event of a week have done
in that family! while poor mr churchil live i suppos there
could not have been a hope a chanc a possibility;--but scarc
are her remain at rest in the famili vault than her husband is
persuad to act exactli opposit to what she would have requir
what a bless it is when undu influenc doe not surviv the grave!--
he gave hi consent with veri littl persuas

ah! thought emma he would have done as much for harriet

thi wa settl last night and frank wa off with the light
thi morn he stop at highburi at the batess i fanci
some time--and then came on hither; but wa in such a hurri to get
back to hi uncl to whom he is just now more necessari than ever
that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour--
he wa veri much agitated--veri much indeed--to a degre that made
him appear quit a differ creatur from ani thing i had ever seen
him before--in addit to all the rest there had been the shock of
find her so veri unwel which he had had no previou suspicion of--
and there wa everi appear of hi have been feel a great deal

and do you realli believ the affair to have been carri on
with such perfect secresy?--th campbel the dixon did none
of them know of the engagement?

emma could not speak the name of dixon without a littl blush

none; not one he posit said that it had been known to no
be in the world but their two selv

well said emma i suppos we shall gradual grow reconcil
to the idea and i wish them veri happi but i shall alway
think it a veri abomin sort of proceed what ha it been
but a system of hypocrisi and deceit--espionag and treachery?--
to come among us with profess of open and simplicity;
and such a leagu in secret to judg us all!--her have we been
the whole winter and spring complet dupe fanci ourselv
all on an equal foot of truth and honour with two peopl in the
midst of us who may have been carri round compar and sit
in judgment on sentiment and word that were never meant for both
to hear--they must take the consequ if they have heard each
other spoken of in a way not perfectli agreeable!

i am quit easi on that head repli mr weston i am
veri sure that i never said ani thing of either to the other
which both might not have heard

you are in luck--your onli blunder wa confin to my ear
when you imagin a certain friend of our in love with the ladi

true but as i have alway had a thoroughli good opinion of miss
fairfax i never could under ani blunder have spoken ill of her;
and as to speak ill of him there i must have been safe

at thi moment mr weston appear at a littl distanc from the window
evid on the watch hi wife gave him a look which invit
him in; and while he wa come round ad now dearest emma
let me intreat you to say and look everi thing that may set hi
heart at eas and inclin him to be satisfi with the match
let us make the best of it--and inde almost everi thing may
be fairli said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify;
but if mr churchil doe not feel that whi should we? and it
may be a veri fortun circumst for him for frank i mean
that he should have attach himself to a girl of such steadi
of charact and good judgment as i have alway given her credit for--
and still am dispos to give her credit for in spite of thi
one great deviat from the strict rule of right and how much
may be said in her situat for even that error!

much indeed! cri emma feelingli if a woman can ever
be excus for think onli of herself it is in a situat
like jane fairfaxs--of such one may almost say that `the
world is not their nor the world law

she met mr weston on hi entranc with a smile counten
exclaim

a veri pretti trick you have been play me upon my word!
thi wa a devic i suppos to sport with my curios
and exercis my talent of guess but you realli frighten me
i thought you had lost half your properti at least and here
instead of it be a matter of condol it turn out to be one
of congratulation--i congratul you mr weston with all my heart
on the prospect of have one of the most love and accomplish
young women in england for your daughter

a glanc or two between him and hi wife convinc him that all wa
as right as thi speech proclaimed; and it happi effect on hi spirit
wa immedi hi air and voic recov their usual briskness:
he shook her heartili and grate by the hand and enter
on the subject in a manner to prove that he now onli want
time and persuas to think the engag no veri bad thing
hi companion suggest onli what could palliat imprud
or smooth objections; and by the time they had talk it all
over togeth and he had talk it all over again with emma
in their walk back to hartfield he wa becom perfectli reconcil
and not far from think it the veri best thing that frank could
possibl have done



chapter xi


harriet poor harriet!--thos were the words; in them lay the
torment idea which emma could not get rid of and which constitut
the real miseri of the busi to her frank churchil had behav
veri ill by herself--veri ill in mani ways--but it wa not so much
_his_ behaviour as her _own_ which made her so angri with him
it wa the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet account
that gave the deepest hue to hi offence--poor harriet! to be a second
time the dupe of her misconcept and flatteri mr knightley
had spoken prophet when he onc said emma you have been
no friend to harriet smith--sh wa afraid she had done her noth
but disservice--it wa true that she had not to charg herself
in thi instanc as in the former with be the sole and origin
author of the mischief; with have suggest such feel as might
otherwis never have enter harriet imagination; for harriet
had acknowledg her admir and prefer of frank churchil
befor she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt
complet guilti of have encourag what she might have repress
she might have prevent the indulg and increas of such sentiment
her influenc would have been enough and now she wa veri consciou
that she ought to have prevent them--sh felt that she had been
risk her friend happi on most insuffici ground
common sens would have direct her to tell harriet that she
must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five
hundr chanc to one against hi ever care for her--but with
common sens she ad i am afraid i have had littl to do

she wa extrem angri with herself if she could not have been
angri with frank churchil too it would have been dreadful--
as for jane fairfax she might at least reliev her feel
from ani present solicitud on her account harriet would
be anxieti enough; she need no longer be unhappi about jane
whose troubl and whose ill-health have of cours the same origin
must be equal under cure--h day of insignific and evil
were over--sh would soon be well and happi and prosperous--
emma could now imagin whi her own attent had been slight
thi discoveri laid mani smaller matter open no doubt it had been
from jealousy--in jane eye she had been a rival; and well might
ani thing she could offer of assist or regard be repuls
an air in the hartfield carriag would have been the rack
and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison
she understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengag itself
from the injustic and selfish of angri feel she acknowledg
that jane fairfax would have neither elev nor happi beyond
her desert but poor harriet wa such an engross charge!
there wa littl sympathi to be spare for ani bodi els
emma wa sadli fear that thi second disappoint would be
more sever than the first consid the veri superior claim
of the object it ought; and judg by it appar stronger effect
on harriet mind produc reserv and self-command it would--
she must commun the pain truth howev and as soon
as possibl an injunct of secresi had been among mr weston
part word for the present the whole affair wa to be
complet a secret mr churchil had made a point of it
as a token of respect to the wife he had so veri recent lost;
and everi bodi admit it to be no more than due decorum--
emma had promised; but still harriet must be except it wa her
superior duti

in spite of her vexat she could not help feel it almost ridicul
that she should have the veri same distress and delic offic to
perform by harriet which mr weston had just gone through by herself
the intellig which had been so anxious announc to her
she wa now to be anxious announc to anoth her heart beat
quick on hear harriet footstep and voice; so she suppos
had poor mr weston felt when _she_ wa approach randal
could the event of the disclosur bear an equal resemblance!--
but of that unfortun there could be no chanc

well miss woodhouse! cri harriet come eagerli into the room--
is not thi the oddest news that ever was?

what news do you mean? repli emma unabl to guess by look
or voic whether harriet could inde have receiv ani hint

about jane fairfax did you ever hear ani thing so strange?
oh!--you need not be afraid of own it to me for mr weston ha
told me himself i met him just now he told me it wa to be
a great secret; and therefor i should not think of mention
it to ani bodi but you but he said you knew it

what did mr weston tell you?--said emma still perplex

oh! he told me all about it; that jane fairfax and mr frank
churchil are to be marri and that they have been privat
engag to one anoth thi long while how veri odd!

it wa inde so odd; harriet behaviour wa so extrem odd
that emma did not know how to understand it her charact appear
absolut chang she seem to propos shew no agit
or disappoint or peculiar concern in the discoveri emma look
at her quit unabl to speak

had you ani idea cri harriet of hi be in love
with her?--you perhap might--you (blush as she spoke)
who can see into everi bodi heart; but nobodi else--

upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my have ani such talent
can you serious ask me harriet whether i imagin him attach
to anoth woman at the veri time that i was--tacitli if not openly--
encourag you to give way to your own feelings?--i never had
the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank
churchil have the least regard for jane fairfax you may be
veri sure that if i had i should have caution you accordingli

me! cri harriet colour and astonish whi should you
caution me?--you do not think i care about mr frank churchil

i am delight to hear you speak so stoutli on the subject
repli emma smiling; but you do not mean to deni that there
wa a time--and not veri distant either--when you gave me reason
to understand that you did care about him?

him!--nev never dear miss woodhous how could you so mistak me?
turn away distress

harriet! cri emma after a moment pause--what do you mean?--
good heaven! what do you mean?--mistak you!--am i to suppos then?--

she could not speak anoth word--her voic wa lost; and she
sat down wait in great terror till harriet should answer

harriet who wa stand at some distanc and with face turn
from her did not immedi say ani thing; and when she did speak
it wa in a voic nearli as agit as emma

i should not have thought it possibl she began that you
could have misunderstood me! i know we agre never to name him--
but consid how infinit superior he is to everi bodi els
i should not have thought it possibl that i could be suppos
to mean ani other person mr frank churchil indeed! i do not
know who would ever look at him in the compani of the other
i hope i have a better tast than to think of mr frank churchil
who is like nobodi by hi side and that you should have been
so mistaken is amazing!--i am sure but for believ that you
entir approv and meant to encourag me in my attach
i should have consid it at first too great a presumpt almost
to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me
that more wonder thing had happened; that there had been
match of greater dispar (those were your veri words);--
i should not have dare to give way to--i should not have thought
it possible--but if _you_ who had been alway acquaint with him--

harriet! cri emma collect herself resolutely--let us
understand each other now without the possibl of farther mistak
are you speak of--mr knightley?

to be sure i am i never could have an idea of ani bodi else--
and so i thought you knew when we talk about him it wa as clear
as possibl

not quit return emma with forc calm for all that
you then said appear to me to relat to a differ person
i could almost assert that you had _named_ mr frank churchil
i am sure the servic mr frank churchil had render you
in protect you from the gipsi wa spoken of

oh! miss woodhous how you do forget!

my dear harriet i perfectli rememb the substanc of what i
said on the occas i told you that i did not wonder at
your attachment; that consid the servic he had render you
it wa extrem natural:--and you agre to it express yourself
veri warmli as to your sens of that servic and mention
even what your sensat had been in see him come forward
to your rescue--th impress of it is strong on my memori

oh dear cri harriet now i recollect what you mean; but i
wa think of someth veri differ at the time it wa not
the gipsies--it wa not mr frank churchil that i meant no! (with
some elevation) i wa think of a much more preciou circumstance--
of mr knightley come and ask me to danc when mr elton
would not stand up with me; and when there wa no other partner in
the room that wa the kind action; that wa the nobl benevol
and generosity; that wa the servic which made me begin to feel
how superior he wa to everi other be upon earth

good god! cri emma thi ha been a most unfortunate--
most deplor mistake!--what is to be done?

you would not have encourag me then if you had understood me?
at least howev i cannot be wors off than i should have been
if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--

she paus a few moment emma could not speak

i do not wonder miss woodhous she resum that you should feel
a great differ between the two as to me or as to ani bodi
you must think one five hundr million time more abov me than
the other but i hope miss woodhous that supposing--that if--
strang as it may appear-- but you know they were your own word
that _more_ wonder thing had happen match of _greater_ dispar
had taken place than between mr frank churchil and me; and therefor
it seem as if such a thing even as thi may have occur before--
and if i should be so fortun beyond express as to--
if mr knightley should really--if _he_ doe not mind the dispar
i hope dear miss woodhous you will not set yourself against it
and tri to put difficulti in the way but you are too good for that
i am sure

harriet wa stand at one of the window emma turn round
to look at her in constern and hastili said

have you ani idea of mr knightley return your affection?

ye repli harriet modestli but not fearfully--i must say
that i have

emma eye were instantli withdrawn; and she sat silent medit
in a fix attitud for a few minut a few minut were suffici
for make her acquaint with her own heart a mind like her
onc open to suspicion made rapid progress she touched--
she admitted--sh acknowledg the whole truth whi wa it
so much wors that harriet should be in love with mr knightley
than with frank churchill? whi wa the evil so dread increas
by harriet have some hope of a return? it dart through her
with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marri no one
but herself!

her own conduct as well as her own heart wa befor her in the
same few minut she saw it all with a clear which had
never bless her befor how improperli had she been act
by harriet! how inconsider how indel how irrat
how unfeel had been her conduct! what blind what mad
had led her on! it struck her with dread forc and she
wa readi to give it everi bad name in the world some portion
of respect for herself howev in spite of all these demerits--
some concern for her own appear and a strong sens of justic
by harriet--(ther would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl
who believ herself love by mr knightley--but justic requir
that she should not be made unhappi by ani cold now)
gave emma the resolut to sit and endur farther with calm
with even appar kindness--for her own advantag inde it wa fit
that the utmost extent of harriet hope should be enquir into;
and harriet had done noth to forfeit the regard and interest
which had been so voluntarili form and maintained--or to deserv
to be slight by the person whose counsel had never led her right--
rous from reflect therefor and subdu her emot
she turn to harriet again and in a more invit accent renew
the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduc it
the wonder stori of jane fairfax that wa quit sunk and lost--
neither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselv

harriet who had been stand in no unhappi reveri wa yet veri glad
to be call from it by the now encourag manner of such a judg
and such a friend as miss woodhous and onli want invit
to give the histori of her hope with great though trembl
delight--emma trembl as she ask and as she listen
were better conceal than harriet but they were not less
her voic wa not unsteady; but her mind wa in all the perturb
that such a develop of self such a burst of threaten evil
such a confus of sudden and perplex emot must create--
she listen with much inward suffer but with great outward
patienc to harriet detail--method or well arrang
or veri well deliv it could not be expect to be;
but it contain when separ from all the feebl and
tautolog of the narrat a substanc to sink her spirit--
especi with the corrobor circumst which her own memori
brought in favour of mr knightley most improv opinion of harriet

harriet had been consciou of a differ in hi behaviour ever sinc
those two decis dances--emma knew that he had on that occas
found her much superior to hi expect from that even
or at least from the time of miss woodhous encourag her
to think of him harriet had begun to be sensibl of hi talk
to her much more than he had been use to do and of hi have
inde quit a differ manner toward her; a manner of kind
and sweetness!--latterli she had been more and more awar of it
when they had been all walk togeth he had so often come and walk
by her and talk so veri delightfully!--h seem to want to be
acquaint with her emma knew it to have been veri much the case
she had often observ the chang to almost the same extent--
harriet repeat express of approb and prais from him--
and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had
known of hi opinion of harriet he prais her for be without
art or affect for have simpl honest gener feelings--
she knew that he saw such recommend in harriet; he had dwelt
on them to her more than once--much that live in harriet memori
mani littl particular of the notic she had receiv from him a look
a speech a remov from one chair to anoth a compliment impli
a prefer infer had been unnot becaus unsuspect
by emma circumst that might swell to half an hour relat
and contain multipli proof to her who had seen them had pass
undiscern by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurr
to be mention the two of strongest promis to harriet were not
without some degre of wit from emma herself--th first
wa hi walk with her apart from the other in the lime-walk
at donwel where they had been walk some time befor emma came
and he had taken pain (a she wa convinced) to draw her from
the rest to himself--and at first he had talk to her in a more
particular way than he had ever done befor in a veri particular
way indeed!--(harriet could not recal it without a blush) he seem
to be almost ask her whether her affect were engaged--
but as soon as she (miss woodhouse) appear like to join them
he chang the subject and began talk about farming:--
the second wa hi have sat talk with her nearli half an hour
befor emma came back from her visit the veri last morn of hi
be at hartfield--though when he first came in he had said
that he could not stay five minutes--and hi have told her
dure their convers that though he must go to london
it wa veri much against hi inclin that he left home at all
which wa much more (a emma felt) than he had acknowledg to _her_
the superior degre of confid toward harriet which thi one
articl mark gave her sever pain

on the subject of the first of the two circumst she did
after a littl reflect ventur the follow question
might he not?--i not it possibl that when enquir as you thought
into the state of your affect he might be allud to mr martin--
he might have mr martin interest in view? but harriet reject
the suspicion with spirit

mr martin! no indeed!--ther wa not a hint of mr martin
i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be
suspect of it

when harriet had close her evid she appeal to her dear
miss woodhous to say whether she had not good ground for hope

i never should have presum to think of it at first said she
but for you you told me to observ him care and let
hi behaviour be the rule of mine--and so i have but now i seem
to feel that i may deserv him; and that if he doe chuse me
it will not be ani thing so veri wonder

the bitter feel occas by thi speech the mani bitter
feel made the utmost exert necessari on emma side
to enabl her to say on repli

harriet i will onli ventur to declar that mr knightley is
the last man in the world who would intent give ani woman
the idea of hi feel for her more than he realli doe

harriet seem readi to worship her friend for a sentenc so satisfactory;
and emma wa onli save from raptur and fond which at
that moment would have been dread penanc by the sound of her
father footstep he wa come through the hall harriet wa
too much agit to encount him she could not compos herself--
mr woodhous would be alarmed--sh had better go;--with most readi
encourag from her friend therefor she pass off through
anoth door--and the moment she wa gone thi wa the spontan
burst of emma feelings: oh god! that i had never seen her!

the rest of the day the follow night were hardli enough
for her thoughts--sh wa bewild amidst the confus
of all that had rush on her within the last few hour
everi moment had brought a fresh surprize; and everi surpriz
must be matter of humili to her--how to understand it all!
how to understand the decept she had been thu practis
on herself and live under!--th blunder the blind of her
own head and heart!--sh sat still she walk about she tri her
own room she tri the shrubbery--in everi place everi postur
she perceiv that she had act most weakly; that she had been impos
on by other in a most mortifi degree; that she had been impos
on herself in a degre yet more mortifying; that she wa wretch
and should probabl find thi day but the begin of wretched

to understand thoroughli understand her own heart wa the
first endeavour to that point went everi leisur moment which her
father claim on her allow and everi moment of involuntari
absenc of mind

how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as everi feel
declar him now to be? when had hi influenc such influenc begun?--
when had he succeed to that place in her affect which frank
churchil had onc for a short period occupied?--sh look back;
she compar the two--compar them as they had alway stood in
her estim from the time of the latter becom known to her--
and as they must at ani time have been compar by her had it--
oh! had it by ani bless felic occur to her to institut
the comparison--sh saw that there never had been a time when she
did not consid mr knightley as infinit the superior or when
hi regard for her had not been infinit the most dear she saw
that in persuad herself in fanci in act to the contrari
she had been entir under a delus total ignor of her
own heart--and in short that she had never realli care for frank
churchil at all!

thi wa the conclus of the first seri of reflect
thi wa the knowledg of herself on the first question of inquiri
which she reached; and without be long in reach it--
she wa most sorrow indignant; asham of everi sensat
but the one reveal to her--her affect for mr knightley--
everi other part of her mind wa disgust

with insuffer vaniti had she believ herself in the secret of everi
bodi feelings; with unpardon arrog propos to arrang everi
bodi destini she wa prove to have been univers mistaken;
and she had not quit done nothing--for she had done mischief
she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much fear
on mr knightley--wer thi most unequ of all connexion to
take place on her must rest all the reproach of have given it
a beginning; for hi attach she must believ to be produc onli
by a conscious of harriets;--and even were thi not the case
he would never have known harriet at all but for her folli

mr knightley and harriet smith!--it wa a union to distanc everi
wonder of the kind--th attach of frank churchil and jane
fairfax becam commonplac threadbar stale in the comparison
excit no surpriz present no dispar afford noth
to be said or thought--mr knightley and harriet smith!--such an
elev on her side! such a debas on his! it wa horribl
to emma to think how it must sink him in the gener opinion
to forese the smile the sneer the merriment it would prompt at
hi expense; the mortif and disdain of hi brother the thousand
inconveni to himself--could it be?--no; it wa imposs
and yet it wa far veri far from impossible--wa it a new
circumst for a man of first-rat abil to be captiv by
veri inferior powers? wa it new for one perhap too busi to seek
to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--wa it new for ani
thing in thi world to be unequ inconsist incongruous--or for
chanc and circumst (a second causes) to direct the human fate?

oh! had she never brought harriet forward! had she left her where
she ought and where he had told her she ought!--had she not
with a folli which no tongu could express prevent her marri
the unexception young man who would have made her happi
and respect in the line of life to which she ought to belong--
all would have been safe; none of thi dread sequel would have been

how harriet could ever have had the presumpt to rais
her thought to mr knightley!--how she could dare to fanci
herself the chosen of such a man till actual assur of it!--
but harriet wa less humbl had fewer scrupl than formerly--
her inferior whether of mind or situat seem littl felt--
she had seem more sensibl of mr elton be to stoop
in marri her than she now seem of mr knightleys--
alas! wa not that her own do too? who had been at pain to give
harriet notion of self-consequ but herself?--who but herself
had taught her that she wa to elev herself if possibl
and that her claim were great to a high worldli establishment?--
if harriet from be humbl were grown vain it wa her do too



chapter xii


till now that she wa threaten with it loss emma had never known
how much of her happi depend on be _first_ with mr knightley
first in interest and affection--satisfi that it wa so
and feel it her due she had enjoy it without reflection;
and onli in the dread of be supplant found how inexpress
import it had been--long veri long she felt she had been first;
for have no femal connexion of hi own there had been
onli isabella whose claim could be compar with her and she
had alway known exactli how far he love and esteem isabella
she had herself been first with him for mani year past
she had not deserv it; she had often been neglig or pervers
slight hi advic or even wil oppos him insens of
half hi merit and quarrel with him becaus he would not
acknowledg her fals and insol estim of her own--but still
from famili attach and habit and thorough excel of mind
he had love her and watch over her from a girl with an endeavour
to improv her and an anxieti for her do right which no
other creatur had at all share in spite of all her fault
she knew she wa dear to him; might she not say veri dear?--
when the suggest of hope howev which must follow here
present themselv she could not presum to indulg them
harriet smith might think herself not unworthi of be peculiarli
exclus passion love by mr knightley _she_ could not
she could not flatter herself with ani idea of blind in hi attach
to _her_ she had receiv a veri recent proof of it impartiality--
how shock had he been by her behaviour to miss bates! how directli
how strongli had he express himself to her on the subject!--not too
strongli for the offence--but far far too strongli to issu from
ani feel softer than upright justic and clear-sight goodwill--
she had no hope noth to deserv the name of hope that he could
have that sort of affect for herself which wa now in question;
but there wa a hope (at time a slight one at time much stronger)
that harriet might have deceiv herself and be overr hi
regard for _her_--wish it she must for hi sake--b the consequ
noth to herself but hi remain singl all hi life
could she be secur of that inde of hi never marri at all
she believ she should be perfectli satisfied--let him but continu
the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley
to all the world; let donwel and hartfield lose none of their
preciou intercours of friendship and confid and her peac
would be fulli secured--marriag in fact would not do for her
it would be incompat with what she owe to her father and with
what she felt for him noth should separ her from her father
she would not marri even if she were ask by mr knightley

it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed;
and she hope that when abl to see them togeth again she might at
least be abl to ascertain what the chanc for it were--sh should
see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedli
as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she wa watch
she did not know how to admit that she could be blind here--
he wa expect back everi day the power of observ would be
soon given--fright soon it appear when her thought were in
one cours in the meanwhil she resolv against see harriet--
it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good
to be talk of it farther--sh wa resolv not to be convinc
as long as she could doubt and yet had no author for oppos
harriet confid to talk would be onli to irritate--sh wrote
to her therefor kindli but decis to beg that she would not
at present come to hartfield; acknowledg it to be her convict
that all farther confidenti discuss of _one_ topic had better
be avoided; and hope that if a few day were allow to pass befor
they met again except in the compani of others--sh object onli
to a tete-a-tete--they might be abl to act as if they had forgotten
the convers of yesterday--harriet submit and approv
and wa grate

thi point wa just arrang when a visitor arriv to tear emma
thought a littl from the one subject which had engross them
sleep or wake the last twenty-four hours--mr weston who had
been call on her daughter-in-law elect and took hartfield in her
way home almost as much in duti to emma as in pleasur to herself
to relat all the particular of so interest an interview

mr weston had accompani her to mr batess and gone through hi
share of thi essenti attent most handsomely; but she have
then induc miss fairfax to join her in an air wa now return
with much more to say and much more to say with satisfact
than a quarter of an hour spent in mr batess parlour with all
the encumbr of awkward feel could have afford

a littl curios emma had; and she made the most of it while
her friend relat mr weston had set off to pay the visit
in a good deal of agit herself; and in the first place had
wish not to go at all at present to be allow mere to write
to miss fairfax instead and to defer thi ceremoni call till
a littl time had pass and mr churchil could be reconcil
to the engag becom known; as consid everi thing
she thought such a visit could not be paid without lead to reports:--
but mr weston had thought differently; he wa extrem anxiou
to shew hi approb to miss fairfax and her famili and did not
conceiv that ani suspicion could be excit by it; or if it were
that it would be of ani consequence; for such thing he observ
alway got about emma smile and felt that mr weston had
veri good reason for say so they had gone in short--and veri
great had been the evid distress and confus of the ladi
she had hardli been abl to speak a word and everi look and action
had shewn how deepli she wa suffer from conscious the quiet
heart-felt satisfact of the old ladi and the raptur delight
of her daughter--who prove even too joyou to talk as usual
had been a gratifi yet almost an affect scene they were
both so truli respect in their happi so disinterest
in everi sensation; thought so much of jane; so much of everi bodi
and so littl of themselv that everi kindli feel wa at work
for them miss fairfax recent ill had offer a fair plea
for mr weston to invit her to an airing; she had drawn back and
declin at first but on be press had yielded; and in the
cours of their drive mr weston had by gentl encourag
overcom so much of her embarrass as to bring her to convers
on the import subject apolog for her seemingli ungraci
silenc in their first recept and the warmest express of the
gratitud she wa alway feel toward herself and mr weston
must necessarili open the cause; but when these effus were put by
they had talk a good deal of the present and of the futur state
of the engag mr weston wa convinc that such convers
must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own
mind as everi thing had so long been and wa veri much pleas
with all that she had said on the subject

on the miseri of what she had suffer dure the conceal
of so mani month continu mr weston she wa energet
thi wa one of her express `i will not say that sinc i
enter into the engag i have not had some happi moments; but i
can say that i have never known the bless of one tranquil hour:--
and the quiver lip emma which utter it wa an attest
that i felt at my heart

poor girl! said emma she think herself wrong then for have
consent to a privat engagement?

wrong! no one i believ can blame her more than she is dispos
to blame herself `the consequ said she `ha been a state
of perpetu suffer to me; and so it ought but after all the
punish that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct
pain is no expiat i never can be blameless i have been act
contrari to all my sens of right; and the fortun turn that everi
thing ha taken and the kind i am now receiv is what my
conscienc tell me ought not to be `do not imagin madam
she continu `that i wa taught wrong do not let ani reflect
fall on the principl or the care of the friend who brought
me up the error ha been all my own; and i do assur you that
with all the excus that present circumst may appear to give
i shall yet dread make the stori known to colonel campbel

poor girl! said emma again she love him then excess
i suppos it must have been from attach onli that she could
be led to form the engag her affect must have overpow
her judgment

ye i have no doubt of her be extrem attach to him

i am afraid return emma sigh that i must often have
contribut to make her unhappi

on your side my love it wa veri innoc done but she
probabl had someth of that in her thought when allud
to the misunderstand which he had given us hint of befor
one natur consequ of the evil she had involv herself in
she said wa that of make her _unreasonable_ the conscious
of have done amiss had expos her to a thousand inquietud
and made her captiou and irrit to a degre that must have been--
that had been--hard for him to bear `i did not make the allow
said she `which i ought to have done for hi temper and spirits--
hi delight spirit and that gaieti that play
of disposit which under ani other circumst would i am sure
have been as constantli bewitch to me as they were at first
she then began to speak of you and of the great kind you
had shewn her dure her illness; and with a blush which shew me
how it wa all connect desir me whenev i had an opportun
to thank you--i could not thank you too much--for everi wish and
everi endeavour to do her good she wa sensibl that you had never
receiv ani proper acknowledg from herself

if i did not know her to be happi now said emma serious
which in spite of everi littl drawback from her scrupul
conscienc she must be i could not bear these thanks;--for oh!
mr weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil
and the good i have done miss fairfax!--wel (check herself
and tri to be more lively) thi is all to be forgotten
you are veri kind to bring me these interest particular
they shew her to the greatest advantag i am sure she is veri good--
i hope she will be veri happi it is fit that the fortun
should be on hi side for i think the merit will be all on her

such a conclus could not pass unansw by mr weston
she thought well of frank in almost everi respect; and what wa more
she love him veri much and her defenc wa therefor earnest
she talk with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection--
but she had too much to urg for emma attention; it wa soon gone
to brunswick squar or to donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;
and when mr weston end with we have not yet had the letter
we are so anxiou for you know but i hope it will soon come
she wa oblig to paus befor she answer and at last oblig
to answer at random befor she could at all recollect what letter it
wa which they were so anxiou for

are you well my emma? wa mr weston part question

oh! perfectli i am alway well you know be sure to give me
intellig of the letter as soon as possibl

mr weston commun furnish emma with more food for
unpleas reflect by increas her esteem and compass
and her sens of past injustic toward miss fairfax she bitterli
regret not have sought a closer acquaint with her and blush
for the enviou feel which had certainli been in some measur
the caus had she follow mr knightley known wish in pay
that attent to miss fairfax which wa everi way her due; had she
tri to know her better; had she done her part toward intimacy;
had she endeavour to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith;
she must in all probabl have been spare from everi pain
which press on her now--birth abil and educ
had been equal mark one as an associ for her to be receiv
with gratitude; and the other--what wa she?--suppos even that
they had never becom intim friends; that she had never been
admit into miss fairfax confid on thi import matter--
which wa most probable--stil in know her as she ought
and as she might she must have been preserv from the abomin
suspicion of an improp attach to mr dixon which she had
not onli so foolishli fashion and harbour herself but had so
unpardon imparted; an idea which she greatli fear had been made
a subject of materi distress to the delicaci of jane feel
by the leviti or careless of frank churchil of all the sourc
of evil surround the former sinc her come to highburi
she wa persuad that she must herself have been the worst
she must have been a perpetu enemi they never could have been
all three togeth without her have stab jane fairfax peac
in a thousand instances; and on box hill perhap it had been
the agoni of a mind that would bear no more

the even of thi day wa veri long and melancholi at hartfield
the weather ad what it could of gloom a cold stormi rain set in
and noth of juli appear but in the tree and shrub which the
wind wa despoil and the length of the day which onli made
such cruel sight the longer visibl

the weather affect mr woodhous and he could onli be kept toler
comfort by almost ceaseless attent on hi daughter side
and by exert which had never cost her half so much befor
it remind her of their first forlorn tete-a-tet on the even
of mr weston wedding-day; but mr knightley had walk
in then soon after tea and dissip everi melancholi fanci
alas! such delight proof of hartfield attract as those
sort of visit convey might shortli be over the pictur which
she had then drawn of the privat of the approach winter
had prove erroneous; no friend had desert them no pleasur
had been lost--but her present forebod she fear would
experi no similar contradict the prospect befor her now
wa threaten to a degre that could not be entir dispelled--
that might not be even partial brighten if all took place
that might take place among the circl of her friend hartfield must
be compar deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the
spirit onli of ruin happi

the child to be born at randal must be a tie there even dearer
than herself; and mr weston heart and time would be occupi
by it they should lose her; and probabl in great measur
her husband also--frank churchil would return among them no more;
and miss fairfax it wa reason to suppos would soon ceas
to belong to highburi they would be marri and settl either
at or near enscomb all that were good would be withdrawn; and if
to these loss the loss of donwel were to be ad what would
remain of cheer or of ration societi within their reach?
mr knightley to be no longer come there for hi even comfort!--
no longer walk in at all hour as if ever will to chang
hi own home for theirs!--how wa it to be endured? and if he were
to be lost to them for harriet sake; if he were to be thought
of hereaft as find in harriet societi all that he wanted;
if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend
the wife to whom he look for all the best bless of existence;
what could be increas emma wretched but the reflect never far
distant from her mind that it had been all her own work?

when it came to such a pitch as thi she wa not abl to refrain
from a start or a heavi sigh or even from walk about the room
for a few seconds--and the onli sourc whenc ani thing like consol
or composur could be drawn wa in the resolut of her own
better conduct and the hope that howev inferior in spirit and
gaieti might be the follow and everi futur winter of her life
to the past it would yet find her more ration more acquaint
with herself and leav her less to regret when it were gone



chapter xiii


the weather continu much the same all the follow morning;
and the same loneli and the same melancholi seem to
reign at hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind
chang into a softer quarter; the cloud were carri off;
the sun appeared; it wa summer again with all the eager
which such a transit give emma resolv to be out of door
as soon as possibl never had the exquisit sight smell
sensat of natur tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm
been more attract to her she long for the seren they might
gradual introduce; and on mr perri come in soon after dinner
with a disengag hour to give her father she lost no time ill
hurri into the shrubbery--ther with spirit freshen
and thought a littl reliev she had taken a few turn when she
saw mr knightley pass through the garden door and come
toward her--it wa the first intim of hi be return
from london she had been think of him the moment befor
as unquestion sixteen mile distant--ther wa time onli for
the quickest arrang of mind she must be collect and calm
in half a minut they were togeth the how dye do were quiet
and constrain on each side she ask after their mutual friends;
they were all well--when had he left them?--onli that morn
he must have had a wet ride--yes--h meant to walk with her
she found he had just look into the dining-room and as he
wa not want there prefer be out of doors--sh thought
he neither look nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possibl
caus for it suggest by her fear wa that he had perhap been
commun hi plan to hi brother and wa pain by the manner
in which they had been receiv

they walk togeth he wa silent she thought he wa often
look at her and tri for a fuller view of her face than it
suit her to give and thi belief produc anoth dread
perhap he want to speak to her of hi attach to harriet;
he might be watch for encourag to begin--sh did not
could not feel equal to lead the way to ani such subject
he must do it all himself yet she could not bear thi silenc
with him it wa most unnatur she considered--resolved--and tri
to smile began--

you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather
surpriz you

have i? said he quietli and look at her; of what nature?

oh! the best natur in the world--a wed

after wait a moment as if to be sure she intend to say no more
he repli

if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchil i have heard
that alreadi

how is it possible? cri emma turn her glow cheek
toward him; for while she spoke it occur to her that he
might have call at mr goddard in hi way

i had a few line on parish busi from mr weston thi morn
and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happen

emma wa quit reliev and could present say with a littl
more composur

_you_ probabl have been less surpriz than ani of us for you have
had your suspicions--i have not forgotten that you onc tri to give
me a caution--i wish i had attend to it--but--(with a sink
voic and a heavi sigh) i seem to have been doom to blind

for a moment or two noth wa said and she wa unsuspici
of have excit ani particular interest till she found her arm
drawn within hi and press against hi heart and heard him
thu say in a tone of great sensibl speak low

time my dearest emma time will heal the wound--your own
excel sense--your exert for your father sake--i know
you will not allow yourself-- her arm wa press again
as he ad in a more broken and subdu accent the feel
of the warmest friendship--indignation--abomin scoundrel!--
and in a louder steadier tone he conclud with he will soon
be gone they will soon be in yorkshir i am sorri for _her_
she deserv a better fate

emma understood him; and as soon as she could recov from the
flutter of pleasur excit by such tender consider repli

you are veri kind--but you are mistaken--and i must set you right--
i am not in want of that sort of compass my blind to what
wa go on led me to act by them in a way that i must alway
be asham of and i wa veri foolishli tempt to say and do mani
thing which may well lay me open to unpleas conjectur but i
have no other reason to regret that i wa not in the secret earlier

emma! cri he look eagerli at her are you indeed?--
but check himself--no no i understand you--forg me--i am
pleas that you can say even so much--h is no object of regret
indeed! and it will not be veri long i hope befor that becom
the acknowledg of more than your reason--fortun that your
affect were not farther entangled!--i could never i confess
from your manner assur myself as to the degre of what you felt--
i could onli be certain that there wa a preference--and a prefer
which i never believ him to deserve--h is a disgrac to the name
of man--and is he to be reward with that sweet young woman?--
jane jane you will be a miser creatur

mr knightley said emma tri to be live but realli confused--
i am in a veri extraordinari situat i cannot let you continu in
your error; and yet perhap sinc my manner gave such an impress
i have as much reason to be asham of confess that i never have
been at all attach to the person we are speak of as it might
be natur for a woman to feel in confess exactli the reverse--
but i never have

he listen in perfect silenc she wish him to speak but he
would not she suppos she must say more befor she were entitl
to hi clemency; but it wa a hard case to be oblig still to lower
herself in hi opinion she went on howev

i have veri littl to say for my own conduct--i wa tempt
by hi attent and allow myself to appear pleased--
an old stori probably--a common case--and no more than ha happen
to hundr of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excus
in one who set up as i do for understand mani circumst
assist the temptat he wa the son of mr weston--h wa
continu here--i alway found him veri pleasant--and in short
for (with a sigh) let me swell out the caus ever so ingeni
they all centr in thi at last--mi vaniti wa flatter and i
allow hi attent latterli however--for some time indeed--
i have had no idea of their mean ani thing--i thought them
a habit a trick noth that call for serious on my side
he ha impos on me but he ha not injur me i have never been
attach to him and now i can toler comprehend hi behaviour
he never wish to attach me it wa mere a blind to conceal
hi real situat with another--it wa hi object to blind
all about him; and no one i am sure could be more effectu
blind than myself--except that i wa _not_ blinded--that it wa my
good fortune--that in short i wa somehow or other safe from him

she had hope for an answer here--for a few word to say that her
conduct wa at least intelligible; but he wa silent; and as far
as she could judg deep in thought at last and toler
in hi usual tone he said

i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill--i can suppos
howev that i may have underr him my acquaint with
him ha been but trifling--and even if i have not underr
him hitherto he may yet turn out well--with such a woman he ha
a chance--i have no motiv for wish him ill--and for her sake
whose happi will be involv in hi good charact and conduct
i shall certainli wish him well

i have no doubt of their be happi togeth said emma;
i believ them to be veri mutual and veri sincer attach

he is a most fortun man! return mr knightley with energi
so earli in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when if a man
chuse a wife he gener chuse ill at three-and-twenti
to have drawn such a prize! what year of felic that man
in all human calcul ha befor him!--assur of the love of
such a woman--th disinterest love for jane fairfax charact
vouch for her disinterestedness; everi thing in hi favour--
equal of situation--i mean as far as regard societi and all the
habit and manner that are important; equal in everi point but one--
and that one sinc the puriti of her heart is not to be doubt
such as must increas hi felic for it will be hi to bestow the
onli advantag she wants--a man would alway wish to give a woman
a better home than the one he take her from; and he who can do it
where there is no doubt of _her_ regard must i think be the happiest
of mortals--frank churchil is inde the favourit of fortun
everi thing turn out for hi good--h meet with a young woman
at a watering-plac gain her affect cannot even weari her
by neglig treatment--and had he and all hi famili sought round
the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found
her superior--hi aunt is in the way--hi aunt dies--h ha
onli to speak--hi friend are eager to promot hi happiness--
he had use everi bodi ill--and they are all delight to forgiv him--
he is a fortun man indeed!

you speak as if you envi him

and i do envi him emma in one respect he is the object of my envi

emma could say no more they seem to be within half a sentenc
of harriet and her immedi feel wa to avert the subject
if possibl she made her plan; she would speak of someth
total different--th children in brunswick square; and she
onli wait for breath to begin when mr knightley startl her
by say

you will not ask me what is the point of envy--y are determin
i see to have no curiosity--y are wise--but _i_ cannot be wise
emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it
unsaid the next moment

oh! then dont speak it dont speak it she eagerli cri
take a littl time consid do not commit yourself

thank you said he in an accent of deep mortif and not
anoth syllabl follow

emma could not bear to give him pain he wa wish to confid in her--
perhap to consult her;--cost her what it would she would listen
she might assist hi resolut or reconcil him to it;
she might give just prais to harriet or by repres to him
hi own independ reliev him from that state of indecis
which must be more intoler than ani altern to such a mind
as his--they had reach the hous

you are go in i suppose? said he

no--repli emma--quit confirm by the depress manner
in which he still spoke--i should like to take anoth turn
mr perri is not gone and after proceed a few step she added--
i stop you ungraci just now mr knightley and i am afraid
gave you pain--but if you have ani wish to speak openli to me
as a friend or to ask my opinion of ani thing that you may have
in contemplation--a a friend inde you may command me--i will
hear whatev you like i will tell you exactli what i think

as a friend!--rep mr knightley--emma that i fear is
a word--no i have no wish--stay ye whi should i hesitate?--
i have gone too far alreadi for concealment--emma i accept your offer--
extraordinari as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you
as a friend--tel me then have i no chanc of ever succeeding?

he stop in hi earnest to look the question and the express
of hi eye overpow her

my dearest emma said he for dearest you will alway be
whatev the event of thi hour convers my dearest
most belov emma--tel me at onc say `no if it is to be said--
she could realli say nothing--y are silent he cri
with great animation; absolut silent! at present i ask no more

emma wa almost readi to sink under the agit of thi moment
the dread of be awaken from the happiest dream wa perhap
the most promin feel

i cannot make speech emma: he soon resumed; and in a tone
of such sincer decid intellig tender as wa
toler convincing--if i love you less i might be abl
to talk about it more but you know what i am--you hear noth
but truth from me--i have blame you and lectur you and you
have born it as no other woman in england would have born it--
bear with the truth i would tell you now dearest emma as well as
you have born with them the manner perhap may have as littl
to recommend them god know i have been a veri indiffer lover--
but you understand me--y you see you understand my feelings--
and will return them if you can at present i ask onli to hear
onc to hear your voic

while he spoke emma mind wa most busi and with all the wonder
veloc of thought had been able--and yet without lose a word--
to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that
harriet hope had been entir groundless a mistak a delus
as complet a delus as ani of her own--that harriet wa nothing;
that she wa everi thing herself; that what she had been say
rel to harriet had been all taken as the languag of her
own feelings; and that her agit her doubt her reluct
her discourag had been all receiv as discourag
from herself--and not onli wa there time for these convict
with all their glow of attend happiness; there wa time also to
rejoic that harriet secret had not escap her and to resolv
that it need not and should not--it wa all the servic she could
now render her poor friend; for as to ani of that heroism of sentiment
which might have prompt her to entreat him to transfer hi affect
from herself to harriet as infinit the most worthi of the two--
or even the more simpl sublim of resolv to refus him
at onc and for ever without vouchsaf ani motiv becaus he
could not marri them both emma had it not she felt for harriet
with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generos run mad
oppos all that could be probabl or reason enter her brain
she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to
her for ever; but her judgment wa as strong as her feel
and as strong as it had ever been befor in reprob ani such
allianc for him as most unequ and degrad her way wa clear
though not quit smooth--sh spoke then on be so entreated--
what did she say?--just what she ought of cours a ladi alway does--
she said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invit him
to say more himself he _had_ despair at one period; he had receiv
such an injunct to caution and silenc as for the time crush
everi hope;--sh had begun by refus to hear him--th chang had
perhap been somewhat sudden;--h propos of take anoth turn
her renew the convers which she had just put an end to
might be a littl extraordinary!--sh felt it inconsistency;
but mr knightley wa so oblig as to put up with it and seek no
farther explan

seldom veri seldom doe complet truth belong to ani human disclosure;
seldom can it happen that someth is not a littl disguis
or a littl mistaken; but where as in thi case though the conduct
is mistaken the feel are not it may not be veri material--
mr knightley could not imput to emma a more relent heart than
she possess or a heart more dispos to accept of hi

he had in fact been wholli unsuspici of hi own influenc
he had follow her into the shrubberi with no idea of tri it
he had come in hi anxieti to see how she bore frank churchil
engag with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavour
if she allow him an open to sooth or to counsel her--th rest
had been the work of the moment the immedi effect of what he heard
on hi feel the delight assur of her total indiffer
toward frank churchil of her have a heart complet disengag
from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain
her affect himself;--but it had been no present hope--h had onli
in the momentari conquest of eager over judgment aspir to be
told that she did not forbid hi attempt to attach her--th superior
hope which gradual open were so much the more enchanting--
the affect which he had been ask to be allow to creat
if he could wa alreadi his!--within half an hour he had pass
from a thoroughli distress state of mind to someth so like
perfect happi that it could bear no other name

_her_ chang wa equal--thi one half-hour had given to each the
same preciou certainti of be belov had clear from each
the same degre of ignor jealousi or distrust--on hi side
there had been a long-stand jealousi old as the arriv
or even the expect of frank churchill--h had been in love
with emma and jealou of frank churchil from about the same period
one sentiment have probabl enlighten him as to the other
it wa hi jealousi of frank churchil that had taken him from
the country--th box hill parti had decid him on go away
he would save himself from wit again such permit
encourag attentions--h had gone to learn to be indifferent--
but he had gone to a wrong place there wa too much domest
happi in hi brother house; woman wore too amiabl a form in it;
isabella wa too much like emma--diff onli in those strike
inferior which alway brought the other in brillianc befor him
for much to have been done even had hi time been longer--h had
stay on howev vigor day after day--til thi veri morn
post had convey the histori of jane fairfax--then with the
glad which must be felt nay which he did not scrupl to feel
have never believ frank churchil to be at all deserv emma
wa there so much fond solicitud so much keen anxieti for her
that he could stay no longer he had ridden home through the rain;
and had walk up directli after dinner to see how thi sweetest
and best of all creatur faultless in spite of all her fault
bore the discoveri

he had found her agit and low--frank churchil wa a villain--
he heard her declar that she had never love him frank churchil
charact wa not desperate--sh wa hi own emma by hand and word
when they return into the house; and if he could have thought
of frank churchil then he might have deem him a veri good sort
of fellow



chapter xiv


what total differ feel did emma take back into the hous
from what she had brought out!--sh had then been onli dare to hope
for a littl respit of suffering;--sh wa now in an exquisit
flutter of happi and such happi moreov as she believ
must still be greater when the flutter should have pass away

they sat down to tea--th same parti round the same table--
how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eye fallen
on the same shrub in the lawn and observ the same beauti
effect of the western sun!--but never in such a state of spirit
never in ani thing like it; and it wa with difficulti that she could
summon enough of her usual self to be the attent ladi of the hous
or even the attent daughter

poor mr woodhous littl suspect what wa plot against him
in the breast of that man whom he wa so cordial welcom and so
anxious hope might not have taken cold from hi ride--could he
have seen the heart he would have care veri littl for the lungs;
but without the most distant imagin of the impend evil
without the slightest percept of ani thing extraordinari in
the look or way of either he repeat to them veri comfort
all the articl of news he had receiv from mr perri and talk
on with much self-content total unsuspici of what they
could have told him in return

as long as mr knightley remain with them emma fever continued;
but when he wa gone she began to be a littl tranquillis
and subdued--and in the cours of the sleepless night which wa
the tax for such an even she found one or two such veri seriou
point to consid as made her feel that even her happi
must have some alloy her father--and harriet she could not be
alon without feel the full weight of their separ claims;
and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost wa the question
with respect to her father it wa a question soon answer
she hardli knew yet what mr knightley would ask; but a veri short
parley with her own heart produc the most solemn resolut
of never quit her father--sh even wept over the idea of it
as a sin of thought while he live it must be onli an engagement;
but she flatter herself that if divest of the danger of
draw her away it might becom an increas of comfort to him--
how to do her best by harriet wa of more difficult decision;--
how to spare her from ani unnecessari pain; how to make
her ani possibl atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--
on these subject her perplex and distress were veri great--
and her mind had to pass again and again through everi bitter
reproach and sorrow regret that had ever surround it--
she could onli resolv at last that she would still avoid a
meet with her and commun all that need be told by letter;
that it would be inexpress desir to have her remov just
now for a time from highburi and--indulg in one scheme more--
nearli resolv that it might be practic to get an invit
for her to brunswick square--isabella had been pleas with harriet;
and a few week spent in london must give her some amusement--
she did not think it in harriet natur to escap be benefit
by novelti and varieti by the street the shop and the children--
at ani rate it would be a proof of attent and kind in herself
from whom everi thing wa due; a separ for the present; an avert
of the evil day when they must all be togeth again

she rose earli and wrote her letter to harriet; an employ
which left her so veri seriou so nearli sad that mr knightley
in walk up to hartfield to breakfast did not arriv at all too soon;
and half an hour stolen afterward to go over the same ground again
with him liter and figur wa quit necessari to reinstat
her in a proper share of the happi of the even befor

he had not left her long by no mean long enough for her to have
the slightest inclin for think of ani bodi els when a letter
wa brought her from randalls--a veri thick letter;--sh guess
what it must contain and deprec the necess of read it--
she wa now in perfect chariti with frank churchill; she want
no explan she want onli to have her thought to herself--
and as for understand ani thing he wrote she wa sure she wa
incap of it--it must be wade through howev she open
the packet; it wa too sure so;--a note from mr weston to herself
usher in the letter from frank to mr weston

i have the greatest pleasur my dear emma in forward
to you the enclos i know what thorough justic you will
do it and have scarc a doubt of it happi effect--i think
we shall never materi disagre about the writer again;
but i will not delay you by a long preface--w are quit well--
thi letter ha been the cure of all the littl nervous i have
been feel lately--i did not quit like your look on tuesday
but it wa an ungeni morning; and though you will never own be
affect by weather i think everi bodi feel a north-east wind--
i felt for your dear father veri much in the storm of tuesday
afternoon and yesterday morn but had the comfort of hear
last night by mr perri that it had not made him ill
your ever

[to mr weston]
windsor-juli
my dear madam

if i made myself intellig yesterday thi letter will be expected;
but expect or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence--
you are all good and i believ there will be need of even
all your good to allow for some part of my past conduct--
but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent
my courag rise while i write it is veri difficult for the
prosper to be humbl i have alreadi met with such success
in two applic for pardon that i may be in danger of think
myself too sure of your and of those among your friend who have
had ani ground of offence--y must all endeavour to comprehend
the exact natur of my situat when i first arriv at randalls;
you must consid me as have a secret which wa to be kept
at all hazard thi wa the fact my right to place myself
in a situat requir such conceal is anoth question
i shall not discuss it here for my temptat to _think_ it a right
i refer everi cavil to a brick hous sash window below
and casement abov in highburi i dare not address her openly;
my difficulti in the then state of enscomb must be too well
known to requir definition; and i wa fortun enough to prevail
befor we part at weymouth and to induc the most upright femal
mind in the creation to stoop in chariti to a secret engagement--
had she refus i should have gone mad--but you will be readi to say
what wa your hope in do this?--what did you look forward to?--
to ani thing everi thing--to time chanc circumst slow effect
sudden burst persever and weari health and sick
everi possibl of good wa befor me and the first of bless
secur in obtain her promis of faith and correspond
if you need farther explan i have the honour my dear madam
of be your husband son and the advantag of inherit
a disposit to hope for good which no inherit of hous
or land can ever equal the valu of--se me then under these
circumst arriv on my first visit to randalls;--and here i
am consciou of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid
you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax
wa in highbury; and as _you_ were the person slight you will
forgiv me instantly; but i must work on my father compass
by remind him that so long as i absent myself from hi hous
so long i lost the bless of know you my behaviour
dure the veri happi fortnight which i spent with you did not
i hope lay me open to reprehens except on one point
and now i come to the princip the onli import part of my
conduct while belong to you which excit my own anxieti
or requir veri solicit explan with the greatest respect
and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse; my father
perhap will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation--
a few word which drop from him yesterday spoke hi opinion
and some censur i acknowledg myself liabl to--mi behaviour
to miss woodhous indic i believ more than it ought--
in order to assist a conceal so essenti to me i wa led
on to make more than an allow use of the sort of intimaci
into which we were immedi thrown--i cannot deni that miss
woodhous wa my ostens object--but i am sure you will believ
the declar that had i not been convinc of her indiffer
i would not have been induc by ani selfish view to go on--
amiabl and delight as miss woodhous is she never gave me
the idea of a young woman like to be attached; and that she wa
perfectli free from ani tendenc to be attach to me wa as much
my convict as my wish--sh receiv my attent with an easi
friendli goodhumour play which exactli suit me
we seem to understand each other from our rel situat
those attent were her due and were felt to be so--wheth miss
woodhous began realli to understand me befor the expir of
that fortnight i cannot say;--when i call to take leav of her
i rememb that i wa within a moment of confess the truth
and i then fanci she wa not without suspicion; but i have no
doubt of her have sinc detect me at least in some degree--
she may not have surmis the whole but her quick must
have penetr a part i cannot doubt it you will find
whenev the subject becom freed from it present restraint
that it did not take her wholli by surpriz she frequent gave
me hint of it i rememb her tell me at the ball that i
owe mr elton gratitud for her attent to miss fairfax--
i hope thi histori of my conduct toward her will be admit
by you and my father as great extenu of what you saw amiss
while you consid me as have sin against emma woodhous
i could deserv noth from either acquit me here and procur
for me when it is allow the acquitt and good wish of that
said emma woodhous whom i regard with so much brotherli affect
as to long to have her as deepli and as happili in love as myself--
whatev strang thing i said or did dure that fortnight you have
now a key to my heart wa in highburi and my busi wa to get
my bodi thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion
if you rememb ani queer set them all to the right account--
of the pianofort so much talk of i feel it onli necessari to say
that it be order wa absolut unknown to miss f-- who would
never have allow me to send it had ani choic been given her--
the delicaci of her mind throughout the whole engag
my dear madam is much beyond my power of do justic to
you will soon i earnestli hope know her thoroughli yourself--
no descript can describ her she must tell you herself what she is--
yet not by word for never wa there a human creatur who would
so designedli suppress her own merit--sinc i began thi letter
which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her--
she give a good account of her own health; but as she never complain
i dare not depend i want to have your opinion of her look
i know you will soon call on her; she is live in dread of the visit
perhap it is paid alreadi let me hear from you without delay;
i am impati for a thousand particular rememb how few
minut i wa at randal and in how bewild how mad a state:
and i am not much better yet; still insan either from happi
or miseri when i think of the kind and favour i have met with
of her excel and patienc and my uncl generos i am mad
with joy: but when i recollect all the uneasi i occas her
and how littl i deserv to be forgiven i am mad with anger
if i could but see her again!--but i must not propos it yet
my uncl ha been too good for me to encroach--i must still add
to thi long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear
i could not give ani connect detail yesterday; but the sudden
and in one light the unseason with which the affair burst out
need explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult as you
will conclud immedi open to me the happiest prospect
i should not have presum on such earli measur but from the
veri particular circumst which left me not an hour to lose
i should myself have shrunk from ani thing so hasti and she would have
felt everi scrupl of mine with multipli strength and refinement--
but i had no choic the hasti engag she had enter into with
that woman--her my dear madam i wa oblig to leav off abruptli
to recollect and compos myself--i have been walk over the countri
and am now i hope ration enough to make the rest of my letter
what it ought to be--it is in fact a most mortifi retrospect
for me i behav shame and here i can admit that my manner
to miss w in be unpleas to miss f were highli blameabl
_she_ disapprov them which ought to have been enough--mi plea of
conceal the truth she did not think sufficient--sh wa displeased;
i thought unreason so: i thought her on a thousand occas
unnecessarili scrupul and cautious: i thought her even cold
but she wa alway right if i had follow her judgment and subdu
my spirit to the level of what she deem proper i should have
escap the greatest unhappi i have ever known--w quarrelled--
do you rememb the morn spent at donwell?--_there_ everi littl
dissatisfact that had occur befor came to a crisi i wa late;
i met her walk home by herself and want to walk with her
but she would not suffer it she absolut refus to allow me
which i then thought most unreason now howev i see noth
in it but a veri natur and consist degre of discret
while i to blind the world to our engag wa behav one
hour with objection particular to anoth woman wa she
to be consent the next to a propos which might have made
everi previou caution useless?--had we been met walk togeth
between donwel and highburi the truth must have been suspected--
i wa mad enough howev to resent--i doubt her affect
i doubt it more the next day on box hill; when provok by
such conduct on my side such shame insol neglect of her
and such appar devot to miss w as it would have been
imposs for ani woman of sens to endur she spoke her
resent in a form of word perfectli intellig to me--
in short my dear madam it wa a quarrel blameless on her side
abomin on mine; and i return the same even to richmond
though i might have staid with you till the next morn
mere becaus i would be as angri with her as possibl even then
i wa not such a fool as not to mean to be reconcil in time;
but i wa the injur person injur by her cold and i went
away determin that she should make the first advances--i shall
alway congratul myself that you were not of the box hill parti
had you wit my behaviour there i can hardli suppos you would
ever have thought well of me again it effect upon her appear
in the immedi resolut it produced: as soon as she found i
wa realli gone from randal she close with the offer of that
offici mr elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her
by the bye ha ever fill me with indign and hatr
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbear which ha been
so richli extend toward myself; but otherwis i should loudli
protest against the share of it which that woman ha known--
`jane indeed!--y will observ that i have not yet indulg myself
in call her by that name even to you think then what i must
have endur in hear it bandi between the elton with all
the vulgar of needless repetit and all the insol of
imaginari superior have patienc with me i shall soon have done--
she close with thi offer resolv to break with me entir
and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again--
_she_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_
_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_--thi letter reach me on the veri
morn of my poor aunt death i answer it within an hour;
but from the confus of my mind and the multipl of busi
fall on me at onc my answer instead of be sent with all
the mani other letter of that day wa lock up in my writing-desk;
and i trust that i had written enough though but a few line
to satisfi her remain without ani uneasiness--i wa rather
disappoint that i did not hear from her again speedily;
but i made excus for her and wa too busi and--may i add?--
too cheer in my view to be captious--w remov to windsor;
and two day afterward i receiv a parcel from her my own letter
all returned!--and a few line at the same time by the post
state her extrem surpriz at not have had the smallest repli
to her last; and ad that as silenc on such a point could
not be misconstru and as it must be equal desir to both
to have everi subordin arrang conclud as soon as possibl
she now sent me by a safe convey all my letter and request
that if i could not directli command her so as to send them
to highburi within a week i would forward them after that period
to her at--: in short the full direct to mr smallridg
near bristol stare me in the face i knew the name the place
i knew all about it and instantli saw what she had been do
it wa perfectli accord with that resolut of charact
which i knew her to possess; and the secreci she had maintain
as to ani such design in her former letter wa equal descript
of it anxiou delicaci for the world would not she have seem
to threaten me--imagin the shock; imagin how till i had actual
detect my own blunder i rave at the blunder of the post--
what wa to be done?--on thing only--i must speak to my uncl
without hi sanction i could not hope to be listen to again--
i spoke; circumst were in my favour; the late event had soften
away hi pride and he wa earlier than i could have anticip
wholli reconcil and complying; and could say at last poor man!
with a deep sigh that he wish i might find as much happi
in the marriag state as he had done--i felt that it would be
of a differ sort--ar you dispos to piti me for what i must
have suffer in open the caus to him for my suspens while
all wa at stake?--no; do not piti me till i reach highburi
and saw how ill i had made her do not piti me till i saw her wan
sick looks--i reach highburi at the time of day when from my
knowledg of their late breakfast hour i wa certain of a good chanc
of find her alone--i wa not disappointed; and at last i wa
not disappoint either in the object of my journey a great deal

chapter xv


thi letter must make it way to emma feel she wa oblig
in spite of her previou determin to the contrari to do
it all the justic that mr weston foretold as soon as she
came to her own name it wa irresistible; everi line relat
to herself wa interest and almost everi line agreeable;
and when thi charm ceas the subject could still maintain itself
by the natur return of her former regard for the writer and the
veri strong attract which ani pictur of love must have for her at
that moment she never stopt till she had gone through the whole;
and though it wa imposs not to feel that he had been wrong
yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffer
and wa veri sorry--and he wa so grate to mr weston
and so much in love with miss fairfax and she wa so happi herself
that there wa no be severe; and could he have enter the room
she must have shaken hand with him as heartili as ever

she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again
she desir him to read it she wa sure of mr weston wish
it to be communicated; especi to one who like mr knightley
had seen so much to blame in hi conduct

i shall be veri glad to look it over said he; but it seem long
i will take it home with me at night

but that would not do mr weston wa to call in the even
and she must return it by him

i would rather be talk to you he replied; but as it seem
a matter of justic it shall be done

he began--stop howev almost directli to say had i been offer
the sight of one of thi gentleman letter to hi mother-in-law a few
month ago emma it would not have been taken with such indiffer

he proceed a littl farther read to himself; and then
with a smile observ humph! a fine complimentari opening:
but it is hi way one man style must not be the rule of anoth
we will not be sever

it will be natur for me he ad shortli afterward to speak my
opinion aloud as i read by do it i shall feel that i am near you
it will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislik it--

not at all i should wish it

mr knightley return to hi read with greater alacr

he trifl here said he as to the temptat he know
he is wrong and ha noth ration to urge--bad--h ought
not to have form the engagement--`hi father disposition:--
he is unjust howev to hi father mr weston sanguin
temper wa a bless on all hi upright and honour exertions;
but mr weston earn everi present comfort befor he endeavour
to gain it--veri true; he did not come till miss fairfax wa here

and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he
might have come sooner if he would you pass it over veri handsomely--
but you were perfectli right

i wa not quit imparti in my judgment emma:--but yet i think--
had _you_ not been in the case--i should still have distrust him

when he came to miss woodhous he wa oblig to read the whole
of it aloud--al that relat to her with a smile; a look;
a shake of the head; a word or two of assent or disapprobation;
or mere of love as the subject required; conclud howev
serious and after steadi reflect thus--

veri bad--though it might have been worse--play a most
danger game too much indebt to the event for hi acquittal--
no judg of hi own manner by you--alway deceiv in fact by hi
own wish and regardless of littl besid hi own convenience--
fanci you to have fathom hi secret natur enough!--
hi own mind full of intrigu that he should suspect it
in others--mystery; finesse--how they pervert the understanding!
my emma doe not everi thing serv to prove more and more the
beauti of truth and sincer in all our deal with each other?

emma agre to it and with a blush of sensibl on harriet account
which she could not give ani sincer explan of

you had better go on said she

he did so but veri soon stopt again to say the pianoforte!
ah! that wa the act of a veri veri young man one too young
to consid whether the inconveni of it might not veri much
exceed the pleasur a boyish scheme indeed!--i cannot
comprehend a man wish to give a woman ani proof of affect
which he know she would rather dispens with; and he did
know that she would have prevent the instrument come if she could

after thi he made some progress without ani paus
frank churchil confess of have behav shame
wa the first thing to call for more than a word in pass

i perfectli agre with you sir--wa then hi remark
you did behav veri shame you never wrote a truer line
and have gone through what immedi follow of the basi
of their disagr and hi persist to act in direct
opposit to jane fairfax sens of right he made a fuller paus
to say thi is veri bad--h had induc her to place herself
for hi sake in a situat of extrem difficulti and uneasi
and it should have been hi first object to prevent her from
suffer unnecessarily--sh must have had much more to contend with
in carri on the correspond than he could he should have
respect even unreason scrupl had there been such; but her
were all reason we must look to her one fault and rememb
that she had done a wrong thing in consent to the engag
to bear that she should have been in such a state of punish

emma knew that he wa now get to the box hill parti
and grew uncomfort her own behaviour had been so veri improper!
she wa deepli asham and a littl afraid of hi next look
it wa all read howev steadili attent and without
the smallest remark; and except one momentari glanc at her
instantli withdrawn in the fear of give pain--no remembr
of box hill seem to exist

there is no say much for the delicaci of our good friend
the elton wa hi next observation--hi feel are natural--
what! actual resolv to break with him entirely!--sh felt
the engag to be a sourc of repent and miseri to each--
she dissolv it--what a view thi give of her sens of
hi behaviour!--wel he must be a most extraordinary--

nay nay read on--you will find how veri much he suffer

i hope he doe repli mr knightley coolli and resum the letter
`smallridge!--what doe thi mean? what is all this?

she had engag to go as gover to mr smallridg children--
a dear friend of mr eltons--a neighbour of mapl grove; and
by the bye i wonder how mr elton bear the disappointment?

say noth my dear emma while you oblig me to read--not even
of mr elton onli one page more i shall soon have done
what a letter the man writes!

i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit toward him

well there _is_ feel here--h doe seem to have suffer in find
her ill--certainli i can have no doubt of hi be fond of her
`dearer much dearer than ever i hope he may long continu to feel
all the valu of such a reconciliation--h is a veri liber thanker
with hi thousand and ten of thousands--`happi than i deserv
come he know himself there `miss woodhous call me the child
of good fortune--thos were miss woodhous word were they?--
and a fine ending--and there is the letter the child of good fortune!
that wa your name for him wa it?

you do not appear so well satisfi with hi letter as i am;
but still you must at least i hope you must think the better
of him for it i hope it doe him some servic with you

ye certainli it doe he ha had great fault fault of
inconsider and thoughtlessness; and i am veri much of hi
opinion in think him like to be happier than he deserves:
but still as he is beyond a doubt realli attach to miss fairfax
and will soon it may be hope have the advantag of be constantli
with her i am veri readi to believ hi charact will improv
and acquir from her the steadi and delicaci of principl
that it want and now let me talk to you of someth els
i have anoth person interest at present so much at heart
that i cannot think ani longer about frank churchil ever sinc i
left you thi morn emma my mind ha been hard at work on
one subject

the subject followed; it wa in plain unaffect gentlemanlik english
such as mr knightley use even to the woman he wa in love with
how to be abl to ask her to marri him without attack the
happi of her father emma answer wa readi at the first word
while her dear father live ani chang of condit must be imposs
for her she could never quit him part onli of thi answer
howev wa admit the imposs of her quit her father
mr knightley felt as strongli as herself; but the inadmiss
of ani other chang he could not agre to he had been think
it over most deepli most intently; he had at first hope to induc
mr woodhous to remov with her to donwell; he had want to believ
it feasibl but hi knowledg of mr woodhous would not suffer
him to deceiv himself long; and now he confess hi persuas
that such a transplant would be a risk of her father comfort
perhap even of hi life which must not be hazard mr woodhous
taken from hartfield!--no he felt that it ought not to be attempt
but the plan which had arisen on the sacrific of thi he trust
hi dearest emma would not find in ani respect objectionable;
it wa that he should be receiv at hartfield; that so long as
her father happi in other word hi life--requir hartfield
to continu her home it should be hi likewis

of their all remov to donwel emma had alreadi had her own
pass thought like him she had tri the scheme and reject it;
but such an altern as thi had not occur to her
she wa sensibl of all the affect it evinc she felt that
in quit donwel he must be sacrif a great deal of independ
of hour and habits; that in live constantli with her father
and in no hous of hi own there would be much veri much
to be born with she promis to think of it and advis him
to think of it more; but he wa fulli convinc that no reflect
could alter hi wish or hi opinion on the subject he had
given it he could assur her veri long and calm consideration;
he had been walk away from william larkin the whole morn
to have hi thought to himself

ah! there is one difficulti unprovid for cri emma i am
sure william larkin will not like it you must get hi consent
befor you ask mine

she promis howev to think of it; and pretti nearli promis moreov
to think of it with the intent of find it a veri good scheme

it is remark that emma in the mani veri mani point of view
in which she wa now begin to consid donwel abbey wa never
struck with ani sens of injuri to her nephew henri whose right
as heir-expect had formerli been so tenaci regard
think she must of the possibl differ to the poor littl boy;
and yet she onli gave herself a sauci consciou smile about it
and found amus in detect the real caus of that violent
dislik of mr knightley marri jane fairfax or ani bodi els
which at the time she had wholli imput to the amiabl solicitud of
the sister and the aunt

thi propos of hi thi plan of marri and continu at hartfield--
the more she contempl it the more pleas it becam
hi evil seem to lessen her own advantag to increas
their mutual good to outweigh everi drawback such a companion
for herself in the period of anxieti and cheerless befor her!--
such a partner in all those duti and care to which time must be
give increas of melancholy!

she would have been too happi but for poor harriet; but everi
bless of her own seem to involv and advanc the suffer
of her friend who must now be even exclud from hartfield
the delight famili parti which emma wa secur for herself
poor harriet must in mere charit caution be kept at a
distanc from she would be a loser in everi way emma could not
deplor her futur absenc as ani deduct from her own enjoy
in such a parti harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;
but for the poor girl herself it seem a peculiarli cruel necess
that wa to be place her in such a state of unmerit punish

in time of cours mr knightley would be forgotten that is
supplanted; but thi could not be expect to happen veri earli
mr knightley himself would be do noth to assist the cure;--
not like mr elton mr knightley alway so kind so feel
so truli consider for everi bodi would never deserv to be
less worship than now; and it realli wa too much to hope even
of harriet that she could be in love with more than _three_ men
in one year



chapter xvi


it wa a veri great relief to emma to find harriet as desir
as herself to avoid a meet their intercours wa pain
enough by letter how much wors had they been oblig to meet!

harriet express herself veri much as might be suppos
without reproach or appar sens of ill-usage; and yet emma fanci
there wa a someth of resent a someth border on it in
her style which increas the desir of their be separate--
it might be onli her own consciousness; but it seem as if an
angel onli could have been quit without resent under such a stroke

she had no difficulti in procur isabella invitation;
and she wa fortun in have a suffici reason for ask it
without resort to invention--ther wa a tooth amiss
harriet realli wish and had wish some time to consult a dentist
mr john knightley wa delight to be of use; ani thing of ill
health wa a recommend to her--and though not so fond of a
dentist as of a mr wingfield she wa quit eager to have harriet
under her care--when it wa thu settl on her sister side
emma propos it to her friend and found her veri persuadable--
harriet wa to go; she wa invit for at least a fortnight; she wa
to be convey in mr woodhous carriage--it wa all arrang
it wa all complet and harriet wa safe in brunswick squar

now emma could inde enjoy mr knightley visits; now she
could talk and she could listen with true happi uncheck by
that sens of injustic of guilt of someth most pain
which had haunt her when rememb how disappoint a heart wa
near her how much might at that moment and at a littl distanc
be endur by the feel which she had led astray herself

the differ of harriet at mr goddard or in london made perhap
an unreason differ in emma sensations; but she could not
think of her in london without object of curios and employ
which must be avert the past and carri her out of herself

she would not allow ani other anxieti to succeed directli to the place
in her mind which harriet had occupi there wa a commun
befor her one which _she_ onli could be compet to make--
the confess of her engag to her father; but she would
have noth to do with it at present--sh had resolv to defer
the disclosur till mr weston were safe and well no addit
agit should be thrown at thi period among those she loved--
and the evil should not act on herself by anticip befor the
appoint time--a fortnight at least of leisur and peac of mind
to crown everi warmer but more agit delight should be her

she soon resolv equal as a duti and a pleasur to employ half
an hour of thi holiday of spirit in call on miss fairfax--
she ought to go--and she wa long to see her; the resembl of
their present situat increas everi other motiv of goodwil
it would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the conscious of a
similar of prospect would certainli add to the interest with
which she should attend to ani thing jane might commun

she went--sh had driven onc unsuccess to the door but had
not been into the hous sinc the morn after box hill when poor
jane had been in such distress as had fill her with compass
though all the worst of her suffer had been unsuspected--
the fear of be still unwelcom determin her though assur
of their be at home to wait in the passag and send up her name--
she heard patti announc it; but no such bustl succeed as poor
miss bate had befor made so happili intelligible--no; she heard
noth but the instant repli of beg her to walk up;--and a moment
afterward she wa met on the stair by jane herself come eagerli
forward as if no other recept of her were felt sufficient--
emma had never seen her look so well so love so engag
there wa conscious anim and warmth; there wa everi
thing which her counten or manner could ever have wanted--
she came forward with an offer hand; and said in a low but veri
feel tone

thi is most kind indeed!--miss woodhous it is imposs
for me to express--i hope you will believe--excus me for be
so entir without word

emma wa gratifi and would soon have shewn no want of word
if the sound of mr elton voic from the sitting-room had not
check her and made it expedi to compress all her friendli
and all her congratulatori sensat into a veri veri earnest
shake of the hand

mr bate and mr elton were togeth miss bate wa out
which account for the previou tranquil emma could have
wish mr elton elsewhere; but she wa in a humour to have patienc
with everi body; and as mr elton met her with unusu gracious
she hope the rencontr would do them no harm

she soon believ herself to penetr mr elton thought
and understand whi she wa like herself in happi spirits;
it wa be in miss fairfax confid and fanci herself
acquaint with what wa still a secret to other peopl
emma saw symptom of it immedi in the express of her face;
and while pay her own compliment to mr bate and appear
to attend to the good old ladi repli she saw her with a sort
of anxiou parad of mysteri fold up a letter which she had appar
been read aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purpl
and gold reticul by her side say with signific nod

we can finish thi some other time you know you and i shall
not want opportun and in fact you have heard all the
essenti alreadi i onli want to prove to you that mr s admit
our apolog and is not offend you see how delight
she write oh! she is a sweet creature! you would have doat
on her had you gone--but not a word more let us be discreet--
quit on our good behaviour--hush!--y rememb those lines--
i forget the poem at thi moment:

for when a ladi in the case
you know all other thing give place

now i say my dear in _our_ case for _lady_ read----mum! a word
to the wise--i am in a fine flow of spirit ant i? but i want
to set your heart at eas as to mr s--_my_ represent you see
ha quit appeas her

and again on emma mere turn her head to look
at mr batess knit she ad in a half whisper

i mention no _names_ you will observe--oh! no; cautiou as
a minist of state i manag it extrem well

emma could not doubt it wa a palpabl display repeat on everi
possibl occas when they had all talk a littl while in harmoni
of the weather and mr weston she found herself abruptli address with

do not you think miss woodhous our sauci littl friend here is
charmingli recovered?--do not you think her cure doe perri the
highest credit?--(her wa a side-gl of great mean at jane)
upon my word perri ha restor her in a wonder short time!--
oh! if you had seen her as i did when she wa at the worst!--
and when mr bate wa say someth to emma whisper farther
we do not say a word of ani _assistance_ that perri might have;
not a word of a certain young physician from windsor--oh! no;
perri shall have all the credit

i have scarc had the pleasur of see you miss woodhous
she shortli afterward began sinc the parti to box hill
veri pleasant parti but yet i think there wa someth want
thing did not seem--that is there seem a littl cloud upon
the spirit of some--so it appear to me at least but i might
be mistaken howev i think it answer so far as to tempt one
to go again what say you both to our collect the same parti
and explor to box hill again while the fine weather lasts?--
it must be the same parti you know quit the same parti
not _one_ except

soon after thi miss bate came in and emma could not help be divert
by the perplex of her first answer to herself result she suppos
from doubt of what might be said and impati to say everi thing

thank you dear miss woodhous you are all kindness--it is imposs
to say--y inde i quit understand--dearest jane prospects--
that is i do not mean--but she is charmingli recovered--
how is mr woodhouse?--i am so glad--quit out of my power--
such a happi littl circl as you find us here--y indeed--
charm young man!--that is--so veri friendly; i mean good mr perry!--
such attent to jane!--and from her great her more than commonli
thank delight toward mr elton for be there emma guess
that there had been a littl show of resent toward jane
from the vicarag quarter which wa now gracious overcome--
after a few whisper inde which place it beyond a guess
mr elton speak louder said

ye here i am my good friend; and here i have been so long
that anywher els i should think it necessari to apologise;
but the truth is that i am wait for my lord and master
he promis to join me here and pay hi respect to you

what! are we to have the pleasur of a call from mr elton?--
that will be a favour indeed! for i know gentlemen do not like
morn visit and mr elton time is so engag

upon my word it is miss bates--h realli is engag from morn
to night--ther is no end of peopl come to him on some pretenc
or other--th magistr and overs and churchwarden
are alway want hi opinion they seem not abl to do ani thing
without him--`upon my word mr e i often say `rather you than i--
i do not know what would becom of my crayon and my instrument
if i had half so mani applicants--bad enough as it is for i
absolut neglect them both to an unpardon degree--i believ
i have not play a bar thi fortnight--howev he is come
i assur you: ye inde on purpos to wait on you all and put
up her hand to screen her word from emma--a congratulatori visit
you know--oh! ye quit indispens

miss bate look about her so happily!--

he promis to come to me as soon as he could disengag himself
from knightley; but he and knightley are shut up togeth
in deep consultation--mr e is knightley right hand

emma would not have smile for the world and onli said is mr elton
gone on foot to donwell?--h will have a hot walk

oh! no it is a meet at the crown a regular meet
weston and cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak onli
of those who lead--i fanci mr e and knightley have everi thing
their own way

have not you mistaken the day? said emma i am almost certain
that the meet at the crown is not till to-morrow--mr knightley
wa at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday

oh! no the meet is certainli to-day wa the abrupt answer
which denot the imposs of ani blunder on mr elton side--
i do believ she continu thi is the most troublesom parish
that ever wa we never heard of such thing at mapl grove

your parish there wa small said jane

upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject
talk of

but it is prove by the small of the school which i have heard
you speak of as under the patronag of your sister and mr bragge;
the onli school and not more than five-and-twenti children

ah! you clever creatur that veri true what a think brain
you have! i say jane what a perfect charact you and i should make
if we could be shaken togeth my liveli and your solid
would produc perfection--not that i presum to insinu howev
that _some_ peopl may not think _you_ perfect already--but hush!--
not a word if you pleas

it seem an unnecessari caution; jane wa want to give her word
not to mr elton but to miss woodhous as the latter plainli saw
the wish of distinguish her as far as civil permit
wa veri evid though it could not often proceed beyond a look

mr elton made hi appear hi ladi greet him with some
of her sparkl vivac

veri pretti sir upon my word; to send me on here to be an
encumbr to my friend so long befor you vouchsaf to come!--
but you knew what a duti creatur you had to deal with
you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared--
here have i been sit thi hour give these young ladi
a sampl of true conjug obedience--for who can say you know
how soon it may be wanted?

mr elton wa so hot and tire that all thi wit seem thrown away
hi civil to the other ladi must be paid; but hi subsequ
object wa to lament over himself for the heat he wa suffer
and the walk he had had for noth

when i got to donwel said he knightley could not be found
veri odd! veri unaccountable! after the note i sent him thi morn
and the messag he return that he should certainli be at home
till one

donwell! cri hi wife--mi dear mr e you have not been
to donwell!--y mean the crown; you come from the meet at the crown

no no that to-morrow; and i particularli want to see knightley
to-day on that veri account--such a dread broil morning!--
i went over the field too--(speak in a tone of great ill-usage)
which made it so much the wors and then not to find him at home!
i assur you i am not at all pleas and no apolog left no messag
for me the housekeep declar she knew noth of my be expected--
veri extraordinary!--and nobodi knew at all which way he wa gone
perhap to hartfield perhap to the abbey mill perhap into hi woods--
miss woodhous thi is not like our friend knightley!--can you
explain it?

emma amus herself by protest that it wa veri extraordinari
inde and that she had not a syllabl to say for him

i cannot imagin said mr elton (feel the indign as a wife
ought to do) i cannot imagin how he could do such a thing by you
of all peopl in the world! the veri last person whom one should expect
to be forgotten!--mi dear mr e he must have left a messag for you
i am sure he must--not even knightley could be so veri eccentric;--
and hi servant forgot it depend upon it that wa the case:
and veri like to happen with the donwel servant who are all
i have often observ extrem awkward and remiss--i am sure i
would not have such a creatur as hi harri stand at our sideboard
for ani consider and as for mr hodg wright hold
her veri cheap indeed--sh promis wright a receipt and never
sent it

i met william larkin continu mr elton as i got near
the hous and he told me i should not find hi master at home
but i did not believ him--william seem rather out of humour
he did not know what wa come to hi master late he said but he
could hardli ever get the speech of him i have noth to do with
william want but it realli is of veri great import that _i_
should see knightley to-day; and it becom a matter therefor
of veri seriou inconveni that i should have had thi hot walk
to no purpos

emma felt that she could not do better than go home directli
in all probabl she wa at thi veri time wait for there;
and mr knightley might be preserv from sink deeper in aggress
toward mr elton if not toward william larkin

she wa pleas on take leav to find miss fairfax determin
to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs;
it gave her an opportun which she immedi made use of
to say

it is as well perhap that i have not had the possibl
had you not been surround by other friend i might have been
tempt to introduc a subject to ask question to speak more
openli than might have been strictli correct--i feel that i should
certainli have been impertin

oh! cri jane with a blush and an hesit which emma thought
infinit more becom to her than all the eleg of all her
usual composure--ther would have been no danger the danger
would have been of my weari you you could not have gratifi
me more than by express an interest-- inde miss woodhous
(speak more collectedly) with the conscious which i
have of misconduct veri great misconduct it is particularli
consol to me to know that those of my friend whose good
opinion is most worth preserv are not disgust to such a
degre as to--i have not time for half that i could wish to say
i long to make apolog excus to urg someth for myself
i feel it so veri due but unfortunately--in short if your
compass doe not stand my friend--

oh! you are too scrupul inde you are cri emma warmli
and take her hand you owe me no apologies; and everi bodi to
whom you might be suppos to owe them is so perfectli satisfi
so delight even--

you are veri kind but i know what my manner were to you--
so cold and artificial!--i had alway a part to act--it wa a life
of deceit!--i know that i must have disgust you

pray say no more i feel that all the apolog should be on my side
let us forgiv each other at onc we must do whatev is to be
done quickest and i think our feel will lose no time there
i hope you have pleasant account from windsor?

veri

and the next news i suppos will be that we are to lose you--
just as i begin to know you

oh! as to all that of cours noth can be thought of yet
i am here till claim by colonel and mr campbel

noth can be actual settl yet perhap repli emma
smiling--but excus me it must be thought of

the smile wa return as jane answer

you are veri right; it ha been thought of and i will own
to you (i am sure it will be safe) that so far as our live
with mr churchil at enscomb it is settl there must be
three month at least of deep mourning; but when they are over
i imagin there will be noth more to wait for

thank you thank you--thi is just what i want to be assur of--
oh! if you knew how much i love everi thing that is decid and open!--
good-by good-by



chapter xvii


mr weston friend were all made happi by her safety;
and if the satisfact of her well-do could be increas
to emma it wa by know her to be the mother of a littl girl
she had been decid in wish for a miss weston she would
not acknowledg that it wa with ani view of make a match
for her hereaft with either of isabella sons; but she wa
convinc that a daughter would suit both father and mother best
it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older--
and even mr weston might be grow older ten year hence--to have
hi firesid enliven by the sport and the nonsens the freak
and the fanci of a child never banish from home; and mr weston--
no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it
would be quit a piti that ani one who so well knew how to teach
should not have their power in exercis again

she ha had the advantag you know of practis on me
she continued--lik la baronn dalman on la comtess dostali
in madam de genli adelaid and theodor and we shall now see
her own littl adelaid educ on a more perfect plan

that is repli mr knightley she will indulg her even more
than she did you and believ that she doe not indulg her at all
it will be the onli differ

poor child! cri emma; at that rate what will becom of her?

noth veri bad--th fate of thousand she will be disagre
in infanc and correct herself as she grow older i am lose
all my bitter against spoilt children my dearest emma
i who am owe all my happi to _you_ would not it be horribl
ingratitud in me to be sever on them?

emma laugh and replied: but i had the assist of all
your endeavour to counteract the indulg of other peopl
i doubt whether my own sens would have correct me without it

do you?--i have no doubt natur gave you understanding:--
miss taylor gave you principl you must have done well
my interfer wa quit as like to do harm as good it wa
veri natur for you to say what right ha he to lectur me?--
and i am afraid veri natur for you to feel that it wa done
in a disagre manner i do not believ i did you ani good
the good wa all to myself by make you an object of the tenderest
affect to me i could not think about you so much without doat
on you fault and all; and by dint of fanci so mani error
have been in love with you ever sinc you were thirteen at least

i am sure you were of use to me cri emma i wa veri often
influenc rightli by you--often than i would own at the time
i am veri sure you did me good and if poor littl anna weston is
to be spoil it will be the greatest human in you to do as much
for her as you have done for me except fall in love with her
when she is thirteen

how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one
of your sauci looks--`mr knightley i am go to do so-and-so;
papa say i may or i have miss taylor leave--someth which
you knew i did not approv in such case my interfer wa give
you two bad feel instead of one

what an amiabl creatur i was!--no wonder you should hold
my speech in such affection remembr

`mr knightley--y alway call me `mr knightley; and
from habit it ha not so veri formal a sound--and yet it is formal
i want you to call me someth els but i do not know what

i rememb onc call you `georg in one of my amiabl fit
about ten year ago i did it becaus i thought it would offend you;
but as you made no object i never did it again

and cannot you call me `georg now?

impossible!--i never can call you ani thing but `mr knightley
i will not promis even to equal the eleg ters of mr elton
by call you mr k--but i will promis she ad present
laugh and blushing--i will promis to call you onc by your
christian name i do not say when but perhap you may guess
where;--in the build in which n take m for better for wors

emma griev that she could not be more openli just to one
import servic which hi better sens would have render her
to the advic which would have save her from the worst of all
her womanli follies--h wil intimaci with harriet smith;
but it wa too tender a subject--sh could not enter on it--
harriet wa veri seldom mention between them thi on hi side
might mere proceed from her not be thought of; but emma
wa rather inclin to attribut it to delicaci and a suspicion
from some appear that their friendship were declin
she wa awar herself that part under ani other circumst
they certainli should have correspond more and that her
intellig would not have rest as it now almost wholli did
on isabella letter he might observ that it wa so the pain
of be oblig to practis conceal toward him wa veri littl
inferior to the pain of have made harriet unhappi

isabella sent quit as good an account of her visitor as could
be expected; on her first arriv she had thought her out of spirit
which appear perfectli natur as there wa a dentist to
be consulted; but sinc that busi had been over she did not
appear to find harriet differ from what she had known her before--
isabella to be sure wa no veri quick observer; yet if harriet
had not been equal to play with the children it would not have
escap her emma comfort and hope were most agreeabl carri on
by harriet be to stay longer; her fortnight wa like to be
a month at least mr and mr john knightley were to come down
in august and she wa invit to remain till they could bring her back

john doe not even mention your friend said mr knightley
here is hi answer if you like to see it

it wa the answer to the commun of hi intend marriag
emma accept it with a veri eager hand with an impati all aliv
to know what he would say about it and not at all check by hear
that her friend wa unment

john enter like a brother into my happi continu mr knightley
but he is no complimenter; and though i well know him to have
likewis a most brotherli affect for you he is so far from
make flourish that ani other young woman might think him rather
cool in her prais but i am not afraid of your see what he write

he write like a sensibl man repli emma when she had read
the letter i honour hi sincer it is veri plain that he
consid the good fortun of the engag as all on my side
but that he is not without hope of my grow in time as worthi
of your affect as you think me alreadi had he said ani thing
to bear a differ construct i should not have believ him

my emma he mean no such thing he onli means--

he and i should differ veri littl in our estim of the two
interrupt she with a sort of seriou smile--much less perhap
than he is awar of if we could enter without ceremoni or reserv
on the subject

emma my dear emma--

oh! she cri with more thorough gaieti if you fanci your
brother doe not do me justic onli wait till my dear father is in
the secret and hear hi opinion depend upon it he will be much
farther from do _you_ justic he will think all the happi
all the advantag on your side of the question; all the merit
on mine i wish i may not sink into `poor emma with him at once--
hi tender compass toward oppress worth can go no farther

ah! he cri i wish your father might be half as easili convinc
as john will be of our have everi right that equal worth can give
to be happi togeth i am amus by one part of john letter--
did you notic it?--wher he say that my inform did not take
him wholli by surpriz that he wa rather in expect of hear
someth of the kind

if i understand your brother he onli mean so far as your have
some thought of marri he had no idea of me he seem perfectli
unprepar for that

ye yes--but i am amus that he should have seen so far into
my feel what ha he been judg by?--i am not consciou
of ani differ in my spirit or convers that could prepar
him at thi time for my marri ani more than at another--
but it wa so i suppos i dare say there wa a differ when i
wa stay with them the other day i believ i did not play
with the children quit so much as usual i rememb one even
the poor boy say `uncl seem alway tire now

the time wa come when the news must spread farther and other person
recept of it tri as soon as mr weston wa suffici
recov to admit mr woodhous visit emma have it in view
that her gentl reason should be employ in the caus
resolv first to announc it at home and then at randalls--
but how to break it to her father at last!--sh had bound herself
to do it in such an hour of mr knightley absenc or when it
came to the point her heart would have fail her and she must
have put it off; but mr knightley wa to come at such a time
and follow up the begin she wa to make--sh wa forc
to speak and to speak cheer too she must not make it a more
decid subject of miseri to him by a melancholi tone herself
she must not appear to think it a misfortune--with all the spirit
she could command she prepar him first for someth strang
and then in a few word said that if hi consent and approb
could be obtained--which she trust would be attend with
no difficulti sinc it wa a plan to promot the happi of all--
she and mr knightley meant to marry; by which mean hartfield
would receiv the constant addit of that person compani
whom she knew he love next to hi daughter and mr weston
best in the world

poor man!--it wa at first a consider shock to him and he tri
earnestli to dissuad her from it she wa remind more than onc
of have alway said she would never marri and assur that it
would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of
poor isabella and poor miss taylor--but it would not do emma hung
about him affection and smile and said it must be so; and that
he must not class her with isabella and mr weston whose marriag
take them from hartfield had inde made a melancholi change:
but she wa not go from hartfield; she should be alway there;
she wa introduc no chang in their number or their comfort but
for the better; and she wa veri sure that he would be a great deal
the happier for have mr knightley alway at hand when he were onc
got use to the idea--did he not love mr knightley veri much?--
he would not deni that he did she wa sure--whom did he ever want
to consult on busi but mr knightley?--who wa so use to him
who so readi to write hi letter who so glad to assist him?--
who so cheer so attent so attach to him?--would not he
like to have him alway on the spot?--y that wa all veri true
mr knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see
him everi day;--but they did see him everi day as it was--whi could
not they go on as they had done?

mr woodhous could not be soon reconciled; but the worst wa overcom
the idea wa given; time and continu repetit must do the rest--
to emma entreati and assur succeed mr knightley
whose fond prais of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;
and he wa soon use to be talk to by each on everi fair occasion--
they had all the assist which isabella could give by letter
of the strongest approbation; and mr weston wa readi
on the first meet to consid the subject in the most
servic light--first as a settl and secondli as a good one--
well awar of the nearli equal import of the two recommend
to mr woodhous mind--it wa agre upon as what wa to be;
and everi bodi by whom he wa use to be guid assur him that
it would be for hi happiness; and have some feel himself
which almost admit it he began to think that some time or other--
in anoth year or two perhaps--it might not be so veri bad
if the marriag did take place

mr weston wa act no part feign no feel in all that she
said to him in favour of the event--sh had been extrem surpriz
never more so than when emma first open the affair to her;
but she saw in it onli increas of happi to all and had
no scrupl in urg him to the utmost--sh had such a regard
for mr knightley as to think he deserv even her dearest emma;
and it wa in everi respect so proper suitabl and unexception
a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest import
so peculiarli elig so singularli fortun that now it seem
as if emma could not safe have attach herself to ani other creatur
and that she had herself been the stupidest of be in not have
thought of it and wish it long ago--how veri few of those men
in a rank of life to address emma would have renounc their own
home for hartfield! and who but mr knightley could know and bear
with mr woodhous so as to make such an arrang desirable!--
the difficulti of dispos of poor mr woodhous had been alway
felt in her husband plan and her own for a marriag between frank
and emma how to settl the claim of enscomb and hartfield had
been a continu impediment--less acknowledg by mr weston than
by herself--but even he had never been abl to finish the subject
better than by saying--thos matter will take care of themselves;
the young peopl will find a way but here there wa noth to be
shift off in a wild specul on the futur it wa all right
all open all equal no sacrific on ani side worth the name
it wa a union of the highest promis of felic in itself
and without one real ration difficulti to oppos or delay it

mr weston with her babi on her knee indulg in such reflect
as these wa one of the happiest women in the world if ani thing
could increas her delight it wa perceiv that the babi would
soon have outgrown it first set of cap

the news wa univers a surpriz wherev it spread;
and mr weston had hi five minut share of it; but five minut
were enough to familiaris the idea to hi quick of mind--
he saw the advantag of the match and rejoic in them with all
the constanc of hi wife; but the wonder of it wa veri soon nothing;
and by the end of an hour he wa not far from believ that he
had alway foreseen it

it is to be a secret i conclud said he these matter are
alway a secret till it is found out that everi bodi know them
onli let me be told when i may speak out--i wonder whether jane ha
ani suspicion

he went to highburi the next morn and satisfi himself on
that point he told her the news wa not she like a daughter
hi eldest daughter?--h must tell her; and miss bate be present
it pass of cours to mr cole mr perri and mr elton
immedi afterward it wa no more than the princip were
prepar for; they had calcul from the time of it be known
at randal how soon it would be over highbury; and were think
of themselv as the even wonder in mani a famili circl
with great sagac

in gener it wa a veri well approv match some might think him
and other might think her the most in luck one set might
recommend their all remov to donwel and leav hartfield
for the john knightleys; and anoth might predict disagr
among their servants; but yet upon the whole there wa no seriou
object rais except in one habit the vicarage--ther
the surpriz wa not soften by ani satisfact mr elton
care littl about it compar with hi wife; he onli hope the
young ladi pride would now be contented; and suppos she had
alway meant to catch knightley if she could; and on the point
of live at hartfield could daringli exclaim rather he than i!--
but mr elton wa veri much discompos indeed--poor knightley!
poor fellow!--sad busi for him--sh wa extrem concerned;
for though veri eccentr he had a thousand good qualities--
how could he be so taken in?--did not think him at all in love--
not in the least--poor knightley!--ther would be an end of all
pleasant intercours with him--how happi he had been to come and dine
with them whenev they ask him! but that would be all over now--
poor fellow!--no more explor parti to donwel made for _her_
oh! no; there would be a mr knightley to throw cold water on
everi thing--extrem disagreeable! but she wa not at all sorri
that she had abus the housekeep the other day--shock plan
live togeth it would never do she knew a famili near mapl
grove who had tri it and been oblig to separ befor the end
of the first quarter



chapter xviii


time pass on a few more to-morrow and the parti from london
would be arriv it wa an alarm change; and emma wa think
of it one morn as what must bring a great deal to agit and
griev her when mr knightley came in and distress thought
were put by after the first chat of pleasur he wa silent;
and then in a graver tone began with

i have someth to tell you emma; some news

good or bad? said she quickli look up in hi face

i do not know which it ought to be call

oh! good i am sure--i see it in your counten you are tri
not to smile

i am afraid said he compos hi featur i am veri much afraid
my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it

indeed! but whi so?--i can hardli imagin that ani thing which
pleas or amus you should not pleas and amus me too

there is one subject he repli i hope but one on which
we do not think alik he paus a moment again smile
with hi eye fix on her face doe noth occur to you?--
do not you recollect?--harriet smith

her cheek flush at the name and she felt afraid of someth
though she knew not what

have you heard from her yourself thi morning? cri he
you have i believ and know the whole

no i have not; i know nothing; pray tell me

you are prepar for the worst i see--and veri bad it is
harriet smith marri robert martin

emma gave a start which did not seem like be prepared--
and her eye in eager gaze said no thi is impossible!
but her lip were close

it is so inde continu mr knightley; i have it from robert
martin himself he left me not half an hour ago

she wa still look at him with the most speak amaz

you like it my emma as littl as i feared--i wish our opinion were
the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make
one or the other of us think differently; and in the meanwhil
we need not talk much on the subject

you mistak me you quit mistak me she repli exert herself
it is not that such a circumst would now make me unhappi
but i cannot believ it it seem an impossibility!--y cannot mean
to say that harriet smith ha accept robert martin you cannot
mean that he ha even propos to her again--yet you onli mean
that he intend it

i mean that he ha done it answer mr knightley with smile
but determin decis and been accept

good god! she cried--well!--then have recours to her workbasket
in excus for lean down her face and conceal all the
exquisit feel of delight and entertain which she knew she
must be express she ad well now tell me everi thing;
make thi intellig to me how where when?--let me know it all
i never wa more surprized--but it doe not make me unhappi
i assur you--how--how ha it been possible?

it is a veri simpl stori he went to town on busi three day ago
and i got him to take charg of some paper which i wa want
to send to john--h deliv these paper to john at hi chamber
and wa ask by him to join their parti the same even to astley
they were go to take the two eldest boy to astley the parti
wa to be our brother and sister henri john--and miss smith
my friend robert could not resist they call for him in their way;
were all extrem amused; and my brother ask him to dine with
them the next day--which he did--and in the cours of that visit
(a i understand) he found an opportun of speak to harriet;
and certainli did not speak in vain--sh made him by her accept
as happi even as he is deserv he came down by yesterday coach
and wa with me thi morn immedi after breakfast to report
hi proceed first on my affair and then on hi own
thi is all that i can relat of the how where and when
your friend harriet will make a much longer histori when you see her--
she will give you all the minut particular which onli woman
languag can make interesting--in our commun we deal onli
in the great--howev i must say that robert martin heart seem
for _him_ and to _me_ veri overflowing; and that he did mention
without it be much to the purpos that on quit their
box at astley my brother took charg of mr john knightley
and littl john and he follow with miss smith and henry;
and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith
rather uneasi

he stopped--emma dare not attempt ani immedi repli to speak
she wa sure would be to betray a most unreason degre
of happi she must wait a moment or he would think her mad
her silenc disturb him; and after observ her a littl while
he ad

emma my love you said that thi circumst would not now make
you unhappy; but i am afraid it give you more pain than you expect
hi situat is an evil--but you must consid it as what satisfi
your friend; and i will answer for your think better and better
of him as you know him more hi good sens and good principl would
delight you--a far as the man is concern you could not wish your
friend in better hand hi rank in societi i would alter if i could
which is say a great deal i assur you emma--y laugh at me
about william larkins; but i could quit as ill spare robert martin

he want her to look up and smile; and have now brought herself
not to smile too broadly--sh did--cheer answer

you need not be at ani pain to reconcil me to the match i think
harriet is do extrem well _her_ connexion may be wors than _his_
in respect of charact there can be no doubt that they are
i have been silent from surpriz mere excess surpriz
you cannot imagin how suddenli it ha come on me! how peculiarli
unprepar i was!--for i had reason to believ her veri late more
determin against him much more than she wa befor

you ought to know your friend best repli mr knightley;
but i should say she wa a good-temp soft-heart girl
not like to be veri veri determin against ani young man who told
her he love her

emma could not help laugh as she answer upon my word
i believ you know her quit as well as i do--but mr knightley
are you perfectli sure that she ha absolut and downright
_accepted_ him i could suppos she might in time--but can she already?--
did not you misunderstand him?--you were both talk of other things;
of busi show of cattl or new drills--and might not you
in the confus of so mani subject mistak him?--it wa not
harriet hand that he wa certain of--it wa the dimens of some
famou ox

the contrast between the counten and air of mr knightley and
robert martin wa at thi moment so strong to emma feel
and so strong wa the recollect of all that had so recent
pass on harriet side so fresh the sound of those word
spoken with such emphasi no i hope i know better than to think
of robert martin that she wa realli expect the intellig
to prove in some measur prematur it could not be otherwis

do you dare say this? cri mr knightley do you dare to suppos
me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talk of?--
what do you deserve?

oh! i alway deserv the best treatment becaus i never put
up with ani other; and therefor you must give me a plain
direct answer are you quit sure that you understand the term
on which mr martin and harriet now are?

i am quit sure he repli speak veri distinctli that he
told me she had accept him; and that there wa no obscur
noth doubt in the word he used; and i think i can give you
a proof that it must be so he ask my opinion as to what he
wa now to do he knew of no one but mr goddard to whom he
could appli for inform of her relat or friend could i
mention ani thing more fit to be done than to go to mr goddard?
i assur him that i could not then he said he would endeavour
to see her in the cours of thi day

i am perfectli satisfi repli emma with the brightest smile
and most sincer wish them happi

you are materi chang sinc we talk on thi subject befor

i hope so--for at that time i wa a fool

and i am chang also; for i am now veri will to grant you all
harriet good qualiti i have taken some pain for your sake
and for robert martin sake (whom i have alway had reason to believ
as much in love with her as ever) to get acquaint with her
i have often talk to her a good deal you must have seen that
i did sometim inde i have thought you were half suspect me
of plead poor martin caus which wa never the case; but from all
my observ i am convinc of her be an artless amiabl girl
with veri good notion veri serious good principl and place
her happi in the affect and util of domest life--
much of thi i have no doubt she may thank you for

me! cri emma shake her head--ah! poor harriet!

she check herself howev and submit quietli to a littl
more prais than she deserv

their convers wa soon afterward close by the entranc of
her father she wa not sorri she want to be alon her mind
wa in a state of flutter and wonder which made it imposs for her
to be collect she wa in danc sing exclaim spirits;
and till she had move about and talk to herself and laugh
and reflect she could be fit for noth ration

her father busi wa to announc jamess be gone out to put
the hors to preparatori to their now daili drive to randalls;
and she had therefor an immedi excus for disappear

the joy the gratitud the exquisit delight of her sensat
may be imagin the sole grievanc and alloy thu remov in the
prospect of harriet welfar she wa realli in danger of becom
too happi for security--what had she to wish for? noth but to
grow more worthi of him whose intent and judgment had been
ever so superior to her own noth but that the lesson
of her past folli might teach her humil and circumspect in futur

seriou she wa veri seriou in her thank and in her resolutions;
and yet there wa no prevent a laugh sometim in the veri midst
of them she must laugh at such a close! such an end of the dole
disappoint of five week back! such a heart--such a harriet!

now there would be pleasur in her returning--everi thing would
be a pleasur it would be a great pleasur to know robert martin

high in the rank of her most seriou and heartfelt felic
wa the reflect that all necess of conceal from
mr knightley would soon be over the disguis equivoc
mysteri so hate to her to practis might soon be over
she could now look forward to give him that full and perfect
confid which her disposit wa most readi to welcom as a duti

in the gayest and happiest spirit she set forward with her father;
not alway listen but alway agre to what he said;
and whether in speech or silenc conniv at the comfort
persuas of hi be oblig to go to randal everi day
or poor mr weston would be disappoint

they arrived--mr weston wa alon in the drawing-room:--
but hardli had they been told of the babi and mr woodhous
receiv the thank for come which he ask for when a glimps
wa caught through the blind of two figur pass near the window

it is frank and miss fairfax said mr weston i wa just
go to tell you of our agreeabl surpriz in see him arriv
thi morn he stay till to-morrow and miss fairfax ha been
persuad to spend the day with us--they are come in i hope

in half a minut they were in the room emma wa extrem glad
to see him--but there wa a degre of confusion--a number of
embarrass recollect on each side they met readili and smile
but with a conscious which at first allow littl to be said;
and have all sat down again there wa for some time such a blank
in the circl that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulg
which she had long felt of see frank churchil onc more
and of see him with jane would yield it proport of pleasur
when mr weston join the parti howev and when the babi
wa fetch there wa no longer a want of subject or animation--
or of courag and opportun for frank churchil to draw near her
and say

i have to thank you miss woodhous for a veri kind forgiv
messag in one of mr weston letter i hope time ha not made
you less will to pardon i hope you do not retract what you
then said

no inde cri emma most happi to begin not in the least
i am particularli glad to see and shake hand with you--and to give
you joy in person

he thank her with all hi heart and continu some time to speak
with seriou feel of hi gratitud and happi

is not she look well? said he turn hi eye toward jane
better than she ever use to do?--you see how my father and
mr weston doat upon her

but hi spirit were soon rise again and with laugh eye
after mention the expect return of the campbel he name
the name of dixon--emma blush and forbad it be pronounc
in her hear

i can never think of it she cri without extrem shame

the shame he answer is all mine or ought to be but is it
possibl that you had no suspicion?--i mean of late earli i know
you had none

i never had the smallest i assur you

that appear quit wonder i wa onc veri near--and i wish i had--
it would have been better but though i wa alway do wrong thing
they were veri bad wrong thing and such as did me no service--
it would have been a much better transgress had i broken the bond
of secreci and told you everi thing

it is not now worth a regret said emma

i have some hope resum he of my uncl be persuad
to pay a visit at randalls; he want to be introduc to her
when the campbel are return we shall meet them in london
and continu there i trust till we may carri her northward--but now
i am at such a distanc from her--i not it hard miss woodhouse?--
till thi morn we have not onc met sinc the day of reconcili
do not you piti me?

emma spoke her piti so veri kindli that with a sudden access
of gay thought he cri

ah! by the bye then sink hi voic and look demur for
the moment--i hope mr knightley is well? he paused--sh colour
and laughed--i know you saw my letter and think you may rememb
my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations--
i assur you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest
and satisfaction--h is a man whom i cannot presum to prais

emma wa delight and onli want him to go on in the same style;
but hi mind wa the next moment in hi own concern and with hi
own jane and hi next word were

did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--
and yet without be actual fair--on cannot call her fair
it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye-lash and hair--
a most distinguish complexion! so peculiarli the ladi in it--
just colour enough for beauti

i have alway admir her complexion repli emma archly; but do not
i rememb the time when you found fault with her for be so pale?--
when we first began to talk of her--hav you quit forgotten?

oh! no--what an impud dog i was!--how could i dare--

but he laugh so heartili at the recollect that emma could
not help say

i do suspect that in the midst of your perplex at that time
you had veri great amus in trick us all--i am sure you had--
i am sure it wa a consol to you

oh! no no no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?
i wa the most miser wretch!

not quit so miser as to be insens to mirth i am sure it
wa a sourc of high entertain to you to feel that you were take
us all in--perhap i am the readier to suspect becaus to tell
you the truth i think it might have been some amus to myself
in the same situat i think there is a littl like between us

he bow

if not in our disposit she present ad with a look of
true sensibl there is a like in our destiny; the destini
which bid fair to connect us with two charact so much superior
to our own

true true he answer warmli no not true on your side you can
have no superior but most true on mine--sh is a complet angel
look at her is not she an angel in everi gesture? observ the turn
of her throat observ her eye as she is look up at my father--
you will be glad to hear (inclin hi head and whisper seriously)
that my uncl mean to give her all my aunt jewel they are to be
new set i am resolv to have some in an ornament for the head
will not it be beauti in her dark hair?

veri beauti inde repli emma; and she spoke so kindli
that he grate burst out

how delight i am to see you again! and to see you in such
excel looks!--i would not have miss thi meet for the world
i should certainli have call at hartfield had you fail to come

the other had been talk of the child mr weston give an
account of a littl alarm she had been under the even befor
from the infant appear not quit well she believ she had
been foolish but it had alarm her and she had been within half
a minut of send for mr perri perhap she ought to be asham
but mr weston had been almost as uneasi as herself--in ten minut
howev the child had been perfectli well again thi wa
her history; and particularli interest it wa to mr woodhous
who commend her veri much for think of send for perri
and onli regret that she had not done it she should alway send
for perri if the child appear in the slightest degre disord
were it onli for a moment she could not be too soon alarm
nor send for perri too often it wa a piti perhap that he
had not come last night; for though the child seem well now
veri well consid it would probabl have been better if perri
had seen it

frank churchil caught the name

fairfax eye my friend mr perry! what are they say
about mr perry?--ha he been here thi morning?--and how doe

of it without laughing--sh hear us she hear us miss woodhous

of her own letter which sent me the report is pass under her eye--
that the whole blunder is spread befor her--that she can attend to

but emma feel were chiefli with jane in the argument; and on

chapter xix


if emma had still at interv an anxiou feel for harriet
a momentari doubt of it be possibl for her to be realli cure
of her attach to mr knightley and realli abl to accept
anoth man from unbias inclin it wa not long that she
had to suffer from the recurr of ani such uncertainti
a veri few day brought the parti from london and she had no
sooner an opportun of be one hour alon with harriet
than she becam perfectli satisfied--unaccount as it was!--
that robert martin had thoroughli supplant mr knightley
and wa now form all her view of happi

harriet wa a littl distressed--did look a littl foolish at first:
but have onc own that she had been presumptu and silli
and self-deceiv befor her pain and confus seem to die
away with the word and leav her without a care for the past
and with the fullest exult in the present and future; for as to
her friend approb emma had instantli remov everi fear of
that natur by meet her with the most unqualifi congratulations--
harriet wa most happi to give everi particular of the even at
astley and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all
with the utmost delight but what did such particular explain?--
the fact wa as emma could now acknowledg that harriet had
alway like robert martin; and that hi continu to love her had
been irresistible--beyond thi it must ever be unintellig
to emma

the event howev wa most joyful; and everi day wa give her
fresh reason for think so--harriet parentag becam known
she prove to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford
her the comfort mainten which had ever been her and decent
enough to have alway wish for concealment--such wa the blood
of gentil which emma had formerli been so readi to vouch for!--
it wa like to be as untaint perhap as the blood of mani
a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been prepar for
mr knightley--or for the churchills--or even for mr elton!--
the stain of illegitimaci unbleach by nobil or wealth
would have been a stain inde

no object wa rais on the father side; the young man wa
treat liberally; it wa all as it should be: and as emma becam
acquaint with robert martin who wa now introduc at hartfield
she fulli acknowledg in him all the appear of sens and worth
which could bid fairest for her littl friend she had no doubt
of harriet happi with ani good-temp man; but with him
and in the home he offer there would be the hope of more
of secur stabil and improv she would be place in the
midst of those who love her and who had better sens than herself;
retir enough for safeti and occupi enough for cheer
she would be never led into temptat nor left for it to find her out
she would be respect and happy; and emma admit her to be
the luckiest creatur in the world to have creat so steadi and
persev an affect in such a man;--or if not quit the luckiest
to yield onli to herself

harriet necessarili drawn away by her engag with the martin
wa less and less at hartfield; which wa not to be regretted--
the intimaci between her and emma must sink; their friendship must
chang into a calmer sort of goodwill; and fortun what ought
to be and must be seem alreadi begin and in the most gradual
natur manner

befor the end of septemb emma attend harriet to church and saw
her hand bestow on robert martin with so complet a satisfact
as no remembr even connect with mr elton as he stood
befor them could impair--perhap inde at that time she
scarc saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose bless at the
altar might next fall on herself--robert martin and harriet smith
the latest coupl engag of the three were the first to be marri

jane fairfax had alreadi quit highburi and wa restor to the
comfort of her belov home with the campbells--th mr churchil
were also in town; and they were onli wait for novemb

the intermedi month wa the one fix on as far as they dare
by emma and mr knightley--they had determin that their marriag
ought to be conclud while john and isabella were still at hartfield
to allow them the fortnight absenc in a tour to the seasid
which wa the plan--john and isabella and everi other friend
were agre in approv it but mr woodhouse--how wa mr woodhous
to be induc to consent?--h who had never yet allud to their
marriag but as a distant event

when first sound on the subject he wa so miser that they
were almost hopeless--a second allus inde gave less pain--
he began to think it wa to be and that he could not prevent it--
a veri promis step of the mind on it way to resign
still howev he wa not happi nay he appear so much otherwis
that hi daughter courag fail she could not bear to see
him suffer to know him fanci himself neglected; and though
her understand almost acquiesc in the assur of both the
mr knightley that when onc the event were over hi distress
would be soon over too she hesitated--sh could not proceed

in thi state of suspens they were befriend not by ani sudden
illumin of mr woodhous mind or ani wonder chang of hi
nervou system but by the oper of the same system in anoth way--
mr weston poultry-hous wa rob one night of all her turkeys--
evid by the ingenu of man other poultry-yard in the
neighbourhood also suffered--pilf wa _housebreaking_ to
mr woodhous fears--h wa veri uneasy; and but for the sens
of hi son-in-law protect would have been under wretch alarm
everi night of hi life the strength resolut and presenc
of mind of the mr knightley command hi fullest depend
while either of them protect him and hi hartfield wa safe--
but mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the
first week in novemb

the result of thi distress wa that with a much more voluntari
cheer consent than hi daughter had ever presum to hope for at
the moment she wa abl to fix her wedding-day--and mr elton wa
call on within a month from the marriag of mr and mr robert
martin to join the hand of mr knightley and miss woodhous

the wed wa veri much like other wed where the parti
have no tast for fineri or parade; and mr elton from the
particular detail by her husband thought it all extrem shabbi
and veri inferior to her own--veri littl white satin veri few
lace veils; a most piti business!--selina would stare when she
heard of it--but in spite of these defici the wish
the hope the confid the predict of the small band
of true friend who wit the ceremoni were fulli answer
in the perfect happi of the union
