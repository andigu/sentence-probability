of mine own eye

mar is it not like the king?
hor as thou art to thi self
such wa the veri armour he had on
when th ambiti norwey combatted:
so frownd he onc when in an angri parl
he smot the sled pollax on the ice
ti strang

mar thu twice befor and iust at thi dead hour
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch

hor in what particular thought to work i know not:
but in the gross and scope of my opinion

mar good now sit down & tell me he that know
whi thi same strict and most obseru watch
so nightli toyl the subiect of the land
and whi such dayli cast of brazon cannon
and forraign mart for implement of warre:
whi such impress of ship-wright whose sore task
do not diuid the sunday from the week
what might be toward that thi sweati hast
doth make the night ioynt-labour with the day:
who ist that can inform me?
hor that can i
at least the whisper goe so: our last king
whose imag euen but now appeard to vs
wa (a you know) by fortinbra of norway
(thereto prickd on by a most emul pride)
dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet
(for so thi side of our known world esteemd him)
did slay thi fortinbras: who by a seald compact
well ratifi by law and heraldri
did forfeit (with hi life) all those hi land
which he stood seizd on to the conqueror:
against the which a moiti compet
wa gage by our king: which had returnd
to the inherit of fortinbra
had he bin vanquish as by the same counant
and carriag of the articl design
hi fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbra
of vnimprou mettl hot and full
hath in the skirt of norway heer and there
sharkd vp a list of landless resolut
for food and diet to some enterpr
that hath a stomack int: which is no other
(and it doth well appear vnto our state)
but to recouer of vs by strong hand
and term compulsatiu those foresaid land
so by hi father lost: and thi (i take it)
is the main motiu of our prepar
the sours of thi our watch and the cheef head
of thi post-hast and romag in the land
enter ghost again

but soft behold: loe where it come againe:
ile cross it though it blast me stay illusion:
if thou hast ani sound or vse of voyc
speak to me if there be ani good thing to be done
that may to thee do eas and grace to me; speak to me
if thou art priuy to thi countri fate
(which happili foreknow may auoyd) oh speak
or if thou hast vp-hoord in thi life
extort treasur in the womb of earth
(for which they say you spirit oft walk in death)
speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellu

mar shall i strike at it with my partizan?
hor do if it will not stand

barn ti heer

mar ti gone

exit ghost

we do it wrong be so maiestical
to offer it the shew of violenc
for it is as the ayr invulner
and our vain blow malici mockeri

barn it wa about to speak when the cock crew

hor and then it start like a guilti thing
vpon a fearful summon i haue heard
the cock that is the trumpet to the day
doth with hi lofti and shrill-sound throat
awak the god of day: and at hi warn
whether in sea or fire in earth or ayr
th extrauag and er spirit hye
to hi confin and of the truth heerein
thi present obiect made probat

mar it fade on the crow of the cock
some say that euer gainst that season come
wherein our sauiour birch is celebr
the bird of dawn singeth all night long:
and then (they say) no spirit can walk abroad
the night are wholsom then no planet strike
no faieri talk nor witch hath power to charme:
so hallowd and so graciou is the time

hor so haue i heard and do in part beleeu it
but look the morn in russet mantl clad
walk ore the dew of yon high eastern hill
break we our watch vp and by my aduic
let vs impart what we haue seen to night
vnto yong hamlet for vpon my life
thi spirit dumb to vs will speak to him:
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
as needful in our loue fit our duty?
mar let dot i pray and i thi morn know
where we shall find him most conueni

the memori be greene: and that it vs befit
to bear our heart in greef and our whole kingdom
to be contract in one brow of woe:
yet so farr hath discret fought with natur
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
togeth with remembr of our selu
therefor our sometim sister now our queen
th imperial ioyntress of thi warlik state
haue we as twere with a defeat ioy
with one auspici and one drop eye
with mirth in funeral and with dirg in marriag
in equal scale weigh delight and dole
taken to wife; nor haue we heerein barrd
your better wisedom which haue freeli gone
with thi affair along for all our thank
now follow that you know young fortinbra
hold a weak supposal of our worth;
or think by our late deer brother death
our state to be disioynt and out of frame
colleagu with the dream of hi aduantage;
he hath not fayld to pester vs with messag
import the surrend of those land
lost by hi father: with all bond of law
to our most valiant brother so much for him
enter voltemand and corneliu

now for our self and for thi time of meet
thu much the business is we haue heer writ
to norway vncle of young fortinbra
who impot and bedrid scars hear

exit voltemand and corneliu

and now laert what the new with you?
you told vs of some suit what ist laertes?
you cannot speak of reason to the dane
and loos your voyc what wouldst thou beg laert
that shall not be my offer not thi asking?
the head is not more natiu to the heart
the hand more instrumental to the mouth
then is the throne of denmark to thi father
what wouldst thou haue laertes?
laer dread my lord
your leaue and fauour to return to franc
from whenc though willingli i came to denmark
to shew my duti in your coron
yet now i must confess that duti done
my thought and wish bend again toward franc
and bow them to your graciou leaue and pardon

king haue you your father leaue?
what say pollonius?
pol he hath my lord:
i do beseech you giue him leaue to go

king take thi fair hour laert time be thine
and thi best grace spend it at thi will:
but now my cosin hamlet and my sonne?

ham not so my lord i am too much ith sun

queen good hamlet cast thi nightli colour off
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for euer with thi veyl lid
seek for thi nobl father in the dust;

pass through natur to etern

ham i madam it is common

queen if it be;
whi seem it so particular with thee

ham seem madam? nay it is: i know not seemes:
ti not alon my inki cloak (good mother)
nor customari suit of solemn black
nor windi suspir of forcd breath
no nor the fruitful riuer in the eye
nor the deiect hauiour of the visag
togeth with all form mood shew of grief
that can denot me truli these inde seem
for they are action that a man might play:
but i haue that within which passeth show;
these but the trap and the suit of woe

king ti sweet and commend
in your natur hamlet
to giue these mourn duti to your father:
but you must know your father lost a father
that father lost lost hi and the suruiuer bound
in filial oblig for some term
to do obsequi sorrow but to perseuer
in obstin condol is a cours
of impiou stubbornness ti vnmanli greef
it shew a will most incorrect to heauen
a heart vnfortifi a mind impati
an vnderstand simpl and vnschoold:
for what we know must be and is as common
as ani the most vulgar thing to senc
whi should we in our peeuish opposit
take it to heart? fye ti a fault to heauen
a fault against the dead a fault to natur
to reason most absurd whose common theam
is death of father and who still hath cri
from the first coars till he that dy to day
thi must be so we pray you throw to earth
thi vnpreuayl woe and think of vs
as of a father; for let the world take note
you are the most immedi to our throne
and with no less nobil of loue
then that which deerest father bear hi sonn
do i impart toward you for your intent
in go back to school in wittenberg
it is most retrograd to our desire:
and we beseech you bend you to remain
heer in the cheer and comfort of our eye
our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonn

qu let not thi mother lose her prayer hamlet:

but the great cannon to the clowd shall tell
and the king rouc the heauen shall bruit again
respeak earthli thunder come away

scena tertia


enter laert and ophelia

laer my necessari are imbarkt; farewell:
and sister as the wind giue benefit
and conuoy is assistant; doe not sleep
but let me hear from you

ophel doe you doubt that?
laer for hamlet and the trifl of hi fauour
hold it a fashion and a toy in bloude;
a violet in the youth of primi nature;
froward not permanent; sweet not last
the supplianc of a minute? no more

ophel no more but so

laer think it no more:
for natur cressant doe not grow alon
in thew and bulke: but as hi templ wax
the inward seruic of the mind and soul
grow wide withal perhap he loue you now
and now no soyl nor cautel doth besmerch
the vertu of hi feare: but you must fear
hi greatness weighd hi will is not hi owne;
for hee himself is subiect to hi birth:
hee may not as vnuallu person doe
caru for himselfe; for on hi choyc depend
the sanctiti and health of the whole state
and therefor must hi choyc be circumscribd
vnto the voyc and yeeld of that bodi
whereof he is the head then if he say he loue you
it fit your wisedom so farr to beleeu it;
as he in hi peculiar sect and forc
may giue hi say deed: which is no further
then the main voyc of denmark goe withal
then weight what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list hi songs;
or lose your heart; or your chast treasur open
to hi vnmastr importun
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
and keep within the rear of your affection;
out of the shot and danger of desir
the chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she vnmask her beauti to the moone:
vertu it self scape not calumni stroak
the canker gall the infant of the spring
too oft befor the button be disclosd
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagi blastment are most immin
be wari then best safeti lie in feare;
youth to it self rebel though none els neer

oph i shall th effect of thi good lesson keep
as watchmen to my heart: but good my brother
doe not as some vngraciou pastor doe
shew me the steep and thorni way to heauen;
whilst like a puft and reckless libertin
himself the primros path of dallianc tread
and reak not hi own read

laer oh fear me not
enter poloniu

i stay too long; but here my father comes:
a doubl bless is a doubl grace;
occas smile vpon a second leaue

polon yet heer laertes? aboord aboord for shame
the wind sit in the shoulder of your sail
and you are staid for there: my bless with you;
and these few precept in thi memori
see thou charact giue thi thought no tongu
nor ani vnproportiond thought hi act:
be thou familiar; but by no mean vulgar:
the friend thou hast and their adopt tride
grappl them to thi soul with hoop of steele:
but doe not dull thi palm with entertain
of each vnhatcht vnfledgd comrad bewar
of entranc to a quarrell: but be in
beart that th oppos may bewar of thee
giue eueri man thine eare; but few thi voyce:
take each man censure; but reseru thi iudgement:
costli thi habit as thi purs can buy;
but not exprest in fancie; rich not gawdie:
for the apparel oft proclaim the man
and they in franc of the best ranck and station
are of a most select and gener cheff in that
neither a borrow nor a lender be;
for lone oft lose both it self and friend:
and borrow dul the edg of husbandri
thi abou all; to thine own self be true:
and it must follow as the night the day
thou canst not then be fals to ani man
farewell: my bless season thi in thee

laer most humbl doe i take my leaue my lord

polon the time inuit you goe your seruant tend

laer farewel ophelia and rememb well
what i haue said to you

oph ti in my memori lockt
and you your self shall keep the key of it

laer farewel

exit laer

polon what ist ophelia he hath said to you?
oph so pleas you somth touch the l[ord] hamlet

polon marri well bethought:
ti told me he hath veri oft of late
giuen priuat time to you; and you your self
haue of your audienc been most free and bounteou
if it be so as so ti put on me;
and that in way of caution: i must tell you
you doe not vnderstand your self so cleer
as it behou my daughter and your honour
what is between you giue me vp the truth?
oph he hath my lord of late made mani tender
of hi affect to me

polon affect puh you speak like a green girl
vnsift in such peril circumst
doe you beleeu hi tender as you call them?
oph i do not know my lord what i should think

polon marri ile teach you; think your self a babi
that you haue tane hi tender for true pay
which are not starl tender your self more dearly;
or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
roam it thu youl tender me a fool

oph my lord he hath importund me with loue
in honour fashion

polon i fashion you may call it go too go too

oph and hath giuen counten to hi speech
my lord with all the vow of heauen

polon i spring to catch woodcock i doe know
when the bloud burn how prodigal the soul
giue the tongu vowes: these blaze daughter
giu more light then heate; extinct in both
euen in their promis as it is a making;
you must not take for fire for thi time daughter
be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
set your entreat at a higher rate
then a command to parley for lord hamlet
beleeu so much in him that he is young
and with a larger tether may he walk
then may be giuen you in few ophelia
doe not beleeu hi vowes; for they are broaker
not of the eye which their inuest show:
but meer implor of vnholi sute
breath like sanctifi and piou bond
the better to beguil thi is for all:
i would not in plain tearm from thi time forth
haue you so slander ani moment leisur
as to giue word or talk with the lord hamlet:
look toot i charg you; come your way

oph i shall obey my lord

that swift as quick-silu it cours through
the natural gate and alli of the body;
and with a sodain vigour it doth posset
and curd like aygr drop into milk
the thin and wholsom blood: so did it mine;
and a most instant tetter bakd about
most lazar-lik with vile and loathsom crust

but howsoeuer thou pursuest thi act
taint not thi mind; nor let thi soul contriu
against thi mother ought; leaue her to heauen

reynol my lord that would dishonour him

polon faith no as you may season it in the charge;
you must not put anoth scandal on him
that hee is open to incontinencie;

that they may seem the taint of liberty;
the flash and out-break of a fieri mind
a sauagen in vnreclaimd bloud of general assault

there wa he game there oretook in rous
there fall out at tennis; or perchanc

videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now;
your bait of falshood take thi cape of truth;
and thu doe we of wisedom and of reach

and with a look so pitiou in purport
as if he had been loos out of hell
to speak of horrors: he come befor me

polon mad for thi loue?
oph my lord i doe not know: but truli i do fear it

polon what said he?
oph he took me by the wrist and held me hard;
then goe he to the length of all hi arme;
and with hi other hand thu ore hi brow
he fal to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it long staid he so
at last a littl shake of mine arme:
and thrice hi head thu wau vp and downe;
he raisd a sigh so pittiou and profound
that it did seem to shatter all hi bulk
and end hi be that done he let me goe
and with hi head ouer hi shoulder turnd
he seemd to find hi way without hi eye
for out ador he went without their helpe;
and to the last bend their light on me

polon goe with me i will goe seek the king
thi is the veri extasi of loue
whose violent properti foredo it self
and lead the will to desper vndertak
as oft as ani passion vnder heauen
that doe afflict our natur i am sorri
what haue you giuen him ani hard word of late?
oph no my good lord: but as you did command
i did repel hi letter and denyd
hi access to me

pol that hath made him mad
i am sorri that with better speed and iudgement
i had not quot him i fear he did but trifl
and meant to wrack thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
it seem it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond our selu in our opinion
as it is common for the yonger sort
to lack discret come go we to the king
thi must be known be kept close might moue
more greef to hide then hate to vtter loue

i know not lost all my mirth forgon all custom of exercise;
and inde it goe so heauenli with my disposition;
that thi goodli frame the earth seem to me a sterril
promontory; thi most excel canopi the ayr
look you thi braue ore-hang thi maiestical roof
fret with golden fire: whi it appear no other thing
to mee then a foul and pestil congreg of vapour
what a piec of work is a man! how nobl in
reason? how infinit in faculty? in form and mou
how express and admirable? in action how like an angel?
in apprehens how like a god? the beauti of the
world the parragon of animals; and yet to me what is
thi quintess of dust? man delight not me; no
nor woman neither; though by your smile you seem
to say so

rosin my lord there wa no such stuff in my
thought

ham whi did you laugh when i said man delight
not me?
rosin to think my lord if you delight not in man
what lenton entertain the player shall receiu
from you: wee coat them on the way and hither are
they com to offer you seruic

ham he that play the king shall be welcome; hi
maiesti shall haue tribut of mee: the aduentur
knight shal vse hi foyl and target: the louer shall
not sigh grati the humor man shall end hi part in
peace: the clown shall make those laugh whose lung
are tickl ath sere: and the ladi shall say her mind
freely; or the blank vers shall halt fort: what player
are they?
rosin euen those you were wont to take delight in
the tragedian of the citi

ham how chanc it they trauaile? their resid
both in reput and profit wa better both
way

rosin i think their inhibit come by the mean
of the late innouation?
ham doe they hold the same estim they did
when i wa in the city? are they so followd?
rosin no inde they are not

ham how come it? doe they grow rusty?
rosin nay their indeauour keep in the wont
pace; but there is sir an ayri of children littl
yase that crye out on the top of question; and
are most tyrann clapt fort: these are now the
fashion and so be-ratl the common stage (so they
call them) that mani wear rapier are affraid of
goose-quil and dare scars come thither

ham what are they children? who maintain em?
how are they escorted? will they pursu the qualiti no
longer then they can sing? will they not say afterward
if they should grow themselu to common player (a
it is most like if their mean are not better) their writer
do them wrong to make them exclaim against their
own success

rosin faith there ha bene much to do on both sides:
and the nation hold it no sinn to tarr them to controuersi
there wa for a while no moni bid for argument
vnless the poet and the player went to cuff in
the question

ham ist possible?
guild oh there ha been much throw about of
brain

excel play; well digest in the scoen set down
with as much modesti as cun i rememb one said
there wa no sallet in the line to make the matter sauory;
nor no matter in the phrase that might indit the
author of affect but cald it an honest method one
cheef speech in it i cheef loud twa aenea tale
to dido and thereabout of it especi where he speak
of priam slaughter if it liue in your memori begin at

thhyrcanian beast it is not so: it begin with pyrrhu
the rug pyrrhu he whose sabl arm
black as hi purpos did the night resembl
when he lay couch in the omin hors
hath now thi dread and black complexion smeard
with heraldri more dismall: head to foot
now is he to take geull horridli trickd
with blood of father mother daughter sonn
bakd and impast with the parch street
that lend a tyrann and damn light
to their vild murther roast in wrath and fire
and thu ore-s with coagul gore

seem to feel hi blow with flame top
stoop to hi bace and with a hideou crash
take prison pyrrhu ear for loe hi sword
which wa declin on the milki head
of reuerend priam seemd ith ayr to sticke:
so as a paint tyrant pyrrhu stood
and like a newtral to hi will and matter did noth
but as we often see against some storm
a silenc in the heauen the rack stand still
the bold wind speechless and the orb below
as hush as death: anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region so after pyrrhu paus
a rows vengeanc set him new a-work
and neuer did the cyclop hammer fall
on mar hi armour forgd for proof etern
with less remors then pyrrhu bleed sword
now fall on priam

break all the spoke and falli from her wheel
and boul the round naue down the hill of heauen

where late the diadem stood and for a robe
about her lank and all ore-team loin
a blanket in th alarum of fear caught vp
who thi had seen with tongu in venom steepd
gainst fortun state would treason haue pronouncd?
but if the god themselu did see her then
when she saw pyrrhu make malici sport
in minc with hi sword her husband limb
the instant burst of clamour that she made
(vnless thing mortal moue them not at all)
would haue made milch the burn eye of heauen

thi world is not for aye nor ti not strang

directli season him hi enemi

our will and fate do so contrari run

becom the field but heer shew much ami
go bid the souldier shoot

exeunt marching: after the which a peal of orden are shot
