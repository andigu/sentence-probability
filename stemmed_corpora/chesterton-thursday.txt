[the man who wa thursday by g k chesterton 1908]

to edmund clerihew bentley

a cloud wa on the mind of men and wail went the weather
yea a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boy togeth
scienc announc nonent and art admir decay;
the world wa old and ended: but you and i were gay;
round us in antic order their crippl vice came--
lust that had lost it laughter fear that had lost it shame
like the white lock of whistler that lit our aimless gloom
men show their own white feather as proudli as a plume
life wa a fli that fade and death a drone that stung;
the world wa veri old inde when you and i were young
they twist even decent sin to shape not to be named:
men were asham of honour; but we were not asham
weak if we were and foolish not thu we fail not thus;
when that black baal block the heaven he had no hymn from us
children we were--our fort of sand were even as weak as eve
high as they went we pile them up to break that bitter sea
fool as we were in motley all jangl and absurd
when all church bell were silent our cap and bed were heard

not all unhelp we held the fort our tini flag unfurled;
some giant labour in that cloud to lift it from the world
i find again the book we found i feel the hour that fling
far out of fish-shap paumanok some cri of cleaner things;
and the green carnat wither as in forest fire that pass
roar in the wind of all the world ten million leav of grass;
or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sing in the rain--
truth out of tusitala spoke and pleasur out of pain
yea cool and clear and sudden as a bird sing in the grey
dunedin to samoa spoke and dark unto day
but we were young; we live to see god break their bitter charm
god and the good republ come ride back in arms:
we have seen the citi of mansoul even as it rock relieved--
bless are they who did not see but be blind believ

thi is a tale of those old fear even of those empti hell
and none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells--
of what coloss god of shame could cow men and yet crash
of what huge devil hid the star yet fell at a pistol flash
the doubt that were so plain to chase so dread to withstand--
oh who shall understand but you; yea who shall understand?
the doubt that drove us through the night as we two talk amain
and day had broken on the street eer it broke upon the brain
between us by the peac of god such truth can now be told;
yea there is strength in strike root and good in grow old
we have found common thing at last and marriag and a creed
and i may safe write it now and you may safe read

chapter i

the two poet of saffron park

the suburb of saffron park lay on the sunset side of london as
red and rag as a cloud of sunset it wa built of a bright
brick throughout; it sky-lin wa fantast and even it ground
plan wa wild it had been the outburst of a specul builder
faintli ting with art who call it architectur sometim
elizabethan and sometim queen ann appar under the
impress that the two sovereign were ident it wa describ
with some justic as an artist coloni though it never in ani
defin way produc ani art but although it pretens to be
an intellectu centr were a littl vagu it pretens to be a
pleasant place were quit indisput the stranger who look for
the first time at the quaint red hous could onli think how veri
oddli shape the peopl must be who could fit in to them nor when
he met the peopl wa he disappoint in thi respect the place
wa not onli pleasant but perfect if onc he could regard it not
as a decept but rather as a dream even if the peopl were not
artist the whole wa nevertheless artist that young man with
the long auburn hair and the impud face--that young man wa not
realli a poet; but sure he wa a poem that old gentleman with
the wild white beard and the wild white hat--that vener
humbug wa not realli a philosopher; but at least he wa the caus
of philosophi in other that scientif gentleman with the bald
egg-lik head and the bare bird-lik neck had no real right to the
air of scienc that he assum he had not discov anyth new
in biology; but what biolog creatur could he have discov
more singular than himself? thu and thu onli the whole place
had properli to be regarded; it had to be consid not so much
as a workshop for artist but as a frail but finish work of art
a man who step into it social atmospher felt as if he had
step into a written comedi

more especi thi attract unreal fell upon it about
nightfal when the extravag roof were dark against the
afterglow and the whole insan villag seem as separ as a
drift cloud thi again wa more strongli true of the mani
night of local festiv when the littl garden were often
illumin and the big chines lantern glow in the dwarfish
tree like some fierc and monstrou fruit and thi wa strongest
of all on one particular even still vagu rememb in the
local of which the auburn-hair poet wa the hero it wa not
by ani mean the onli even of which he wa the hero on mani
night those pass by hi littl back garden might hear hi high
didact voic lay down the law to men and particularli to
women the attitud of women in such case wa inde one of the
paradox of the place most of the women were of the kind vagu
call emancip and profess some protest against male
supremaci yet these new women would alway pay to a man the
extravag compliment which no ordinari woman ever pay to him
that of listen while he is talk and mr lucian gregori the
red-hair poet wa realli (in some sense) a man worth listen
to even if one onli laugh at the end of it he put the old cant
of the lawless of art and the art of lawless with a certain
impud fresh which gave at least a momentari pleasur he wa
help in some degre by the arrest odditi of hi appear
which he work as the phrase goe for all it wa worth hi dark
red hair part in the middl wa liter like a woman and
curv into the slow curl of a virgin in a pre-raphaelit pictur
from within thi almost saintli oval howev hi face project
suddenli broad and brutal the chin carri forward with a look of
cockney contempt thi combin at onc tickl and terrifi
the nerv of a neurot popul he seem like a walk
blasphemi a blend of the angel and the ape

thi particular even if it is rememb for noth els
will be rememb in that place for it strang sunset it look
like the end of the world all the heaven seem cover with a
quit vivid and palpabl plumage; you could onli say that the sky
wa full of feather and of feather that almost brush the
face across the great part of the dome they were grey with the
strangest tint of violet and mauv and an unnatur pink or pale
green; but toward the west the whole grew past descript
transpar and passion and the last red-hot plume of it
cover up the sun like someth too good to be seen the whole
wa so close about the earth as to express noth but a violent
secreci the veri empyrean seem to be a secret it express
that splendid small which is the soul of local patriot the
veri sky seem small

i say that there are some inhabit who may rememb the even
if onli by that oppress sky there are other who may rememb
it becaus it mark the first appear in the place of the
second poet of saffron park for a long time the red-hair
revolutionari had reign without a rival; it wa upon the night
of the sunset that hi solitud suddenli end the new poet who
introduc himself by the name of gabriel syme wa a veri
mild-look mortal with a fair point beard and faint yellow
hair but an impress grew that he wa less meek than he look
he signalis hi entranc by differ with the establish poet
gregori upon the whole natur of poetri he said that he (syme)
wa poet of law a poet of order; nay he said he wa a poet of
respect so all the saffron parker look at him as if he
had that moment fallen out of that imposs sky

in fact mr lucian gregori the anarch poet connect the two
event

it may well be he said in hi sudden lyric manner it may
well be on such a night of cloud and cruel colour that there is
brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respect poet
you say you are a poet of law; i say you are a contradict in
term i onli wonder there were not comet and earthquak on the
night you appear in thi garden

the man with the meek blue eye and the pale point beard endur
these thunder with a certain submiss solemn the third parti
of the group gregori sister rosamond who had her brother
braid of red hair but a kindlier face underneath them laugh
with such mixtur of admir and disapprov as she gave
commonli to the famili oracl

gregori resum in high orator good humour

an artist is ident with an anarchist he cri you might
transpos the word anywher an anarchist is an artist the man
who throw a bomb is an artist becaus he prefer a great moment
to everyth he see how much more valuabl is one burst of
blaze light one peal of perfect thunder than the mere common
bodi of a few shapeless policemen an artist disregard all
govern abolish all convent the poet delight in
disord onli if it were not so the most poetic thing in the
world would be the underground railway

so it is said mr syme

nonsense! said gregori who wa veri ration when anyon els
attempt paradox whi do all the clerk and navvi in the
railway train look so sad and tire so veri sad and tired? i will
tell you it is becaus they know that the train is go right it
is becaus they know that whatev place they have taken a ticket
for that place they will reach it is becaus after they have
pass sloan squar they know that the next station must be
victoria and noth but victoria oh their wild rapture! oh
their eye like star and their soul again in eden if the next
station were unaccount baker street!

it is you who are unpoet repli the poet syme if what you
say of clerk is true they can onli be as prosaic as your poetri
the rare strang thing is to hit the mark; the gross obviou
thing is to miss it we feel it is epic when man with one wild
arrow strike a distant bird is it not also epic when man with
one wild engin strike a distant station? chao is dull; becaus
in chao the train might inde go anywher to baker street or to
bagdad but man is a magician and hi whole magic is in thi that
he doe say victoria and lo! it is victoria no take your book
of mere poetri and prose; let me read a time tabl with tear of
pride take your byron who commemor the defeat of man; give
me bradshaw who commemor hi victori give me bradshaw i
say!

must you go? inquir gregori sarcast

i tell you went on syme with passion that everi time a train
come in i feel that it ha broken past batteri of besieg and
that man ha won a battl against chao you say contemptu
that when one ha left sloan squar one must come to victoria i
say that one might do a thousand thing instead and that whenev
i realli come there i have the sens of hairbreadth escap and
when i hear the guard shout out the word victoria it is not an
unmean word it is to me the cri of a herald announc
conquest it is to me inde victoria; it is the victori of
adam

gregori wag hi heavi red head with a slow and sad smile

and even then he said we poet alway ask the question and
what is victoria now that you have got there ? you think victoria
is like the new jerusalem we know that the new jerusalem will onli
be like victoria ye the poet will be discont even in the
street of heaven the poet is alway in revolt

there again said syme irrit what is there poetic about
be in revolt ? you might as well say that it is poetic to be
sea-sick be sick is a revolt both be sick and be
rebelli may be the wholesom thing on certain desper
occasions; but im hang if i can see whi they are poetic
revolt in the abstract is--revolt it mere vomit

the girl winc for a flash at the unpleas word but syme wa
too hot to heed her

it is thing go right he cri that is poetic i our
digest for instanc go sacredli and silent right that
is the foundat of all poetri ye the most poetic thing more
poetic than the flower more poetic than the stars--th most
poetic thing in the world is not be sick

realli said gregori supercili the exampl you choose--

i beg your pardon said syme grimli i forgot we had abolish
all convent

for the first time a red patch appear on gregori forehead

you dont expect me he said to revolutionis societi on thi
lawn ?

syme look straight into hi eye and smile sweetli

no i dont he said; but i suppos that if you were seriou
about your anarch that is exactli what you would do

gregori big bull eye blink suddenli like those of an angri
lion and one could almost fanci that hi red mane rose

dont you think then he said in a danger voic that i am
seriou about my anarchism?

i beg your pardon ? said syme

am i not seriou about my anarch ? cri gregori with knot
fist

my dear fellow! said syme and stroll away

with surpris but with a curiou pleasur he found rosamond
gregori still in hi compani

mr syme she said do the peopl who talk like you and my
brother often mean what they say ? do you mean what you say now ?

syme smile

do you ? he ask

what do you mean ? ask the girl with grave eye

my dear miss gregori said syme gentli there are mani kind of
sincer and insincer when you say thank you for the salt
do you mean what you say ? no when you say the world is round
do you mean what you say ? no it is true but you dont mean it
now sometim a man like your brother realli find a thing he doe
mean it may be onli a half-truth quarter-truth tenth-truth; but
then he say more than he means--from sheer forc of mean it

she wa look at him from under level brows; her face wa grave
and open and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that
unreason respons which is at the bottom of the most
frivol woman the matern watch which is as old as the world

is he realli an anarchist then? she ask

onli in that sens i speak of repli syme; or if you prefer
it in that nonsens

she drew her broad brow togeth and said abruptly--

he wouldnt realli use--bomb or that sort of thing?

syme broke into a great laugh that seem too larg for hi slight
and somewhat dandifi figur

good lord no! he said that ha to be done anonym

and at that the corner of her own mouth broke into a smile and
she thought with a simultan pleasur of gregori absurd
and of hi safeti

syme stroll with her to a seat in the corner of the garden and
continu to pour out hi opinion for he wa a sincer man and
in spite of hi superfici air and grace at root a humbl one
and it is alway the humbl man who talk too much; the proud man
watch himself too close he defend respect with
violenc and exagger he grew passion in hi prais of
tidi and proprieti all the time there wa a smell of lilac
all round him onc he heard veri faintli in some distant street a
barrel-organ begin to play and it seem to him that hi heroic
word were move to a tini tune from under or beyond the world

he stare and talk at the girl red hair and amus face for
what seem to be a few minutes; and then feel that the group
in such a place should mix rose to hi feet to hi astonish
he discov the whole garden empti everyon had gone long ago
and he went himself with a rather hurri apolog he left with a
sens of champagn in hi head which he could not afterward
explain in the wild event which were to follow thi girl had no
part at all; he never saw her again until all hi tale wa over
and yet in some indescrib way she kept recur like a
motiv in music through all hi mad adventur afterward and the
glori of her strang hair ran like a red thread through those dark
and ill-drawn tapestri of the night for what follow wa so
improb that it might well have been a dream

when syme went out into the starlit street he found it for the
moment empti then he realis (in some odd way) that the silenc
wa rather a live silenc than a dead one directli outsid the
door stood a street lamp whose gleam gild the leav of the tree
that bent out over the fenc behind him about a foot from the
lamp-post stood a figur almost as rigid and motionless as the
lamp-post itself the tall hat and long frock coat were black; the
face in an abrupt shadow wa almost as dark onli a fring of
fieri hair against the light and also someth aggress in the
attitud proclaim that it wa the poet gregori he had someth
of the look of a mask bravo wait sword in hand for hi foe

he made a sort of doubt salut which syme somewhat more
formal return

i wa wait for you said gregori might i have a moment
conversation?

certainli about what? ask syme in a sort of weak wonder

gregori struck out with hi stick at the lamp-post and then at the
tree about thi and thi he cried; about order and anarchi
there is your preciou order that lean iron lamp ugli and
barren; and there is anarchi rich live reproduc
itself--ther is anarchi splendid in green and gold

all the same repli syme patient just at present you onli
see the tree by the light of the lamp i wonder when you would ever
see the lamp by the light of the tree then after a paus he said
but may i ask if you have been stand out here in the dark onli
to resum our littl argument?

no cri out gregori in a voic that rang down the street i
did not stand here to resum our argument but to end it for ever

the silenc fell again and syme though he understood noth
listen instinct for someth seriou gregori began in a
smooth voic and with a rather bewild smile

mr syme he said thi even you succeed in do someth
rather remark you did someth to me that no man born of
woman ha ever succeed in do befor

indeed!

now i rememb resum gregori reflect one other person
succeed in do it the captain of a penni steamer (if i
rememb correctly) at southend you have irrit me

i am veri sorri repli syme with graviti

i am afraid my furi and your insult are too shock to be wipe
out even with an apolog said gregori veri calmli no duel
could wipe it out if i struck you dead i could not wipe it out
there is onli one way by which that insult can be eras and that
way i choos i am go at the possibl sacrific of my life and
honour to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said

in what i said?

you said i wa not seriou about be an anarchist

there are degre of serious repli syme i have never
doubt that you were perfectli sincer in thi sens that you
thought what you said well worth say that you thought a
paradox might wake men up to a neglect truth

gregori stare at him steadili and pain

and in no other sens he ask you think me serious? you think
me a flaneur who let fall occasion truth you do not think that
in a deeper a more deadli sens i am seriou

syme struck hi stick violent on the stone of the road

serious! he cri good lord! is thi street serious? are these
damn chines lantern serious? is the whole caboodl serious?
one come here and talk a pack of bosh and perhap some sens as
well but i should think veri littl of a man who didnt keep
someth in the background of hi life that wa more seriou than
all thi talking--someth more seriou whether it wa religion
or onli drink

veri well said gregori hi face darken you shall see
someth more seriou than either drink or religion

syme stood wait with hi usual air of mild until gregori
again open hi lip

you spoke just now of have a religion is it realli true that
you have one?

oh said syme with a beam smile we are all cathol now

then may i ask you to swear by whatev god or saint your
religion involv that you will not reveal what i am now go to
tell you to ani son of adam and especi not to the police?
will you swear that! if you will take upon yourself thi aw
abneg if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow
that you should never make and a knowledg you should never dream
about i will promis you in return--

you will promis me in return? inquir syme as the other
paus

i will promis you a veri entertain even syme suddenli
took off hi hat

your offer he said is far too idiot to be declin you say
that a poet is alway an anarchist i disagree; but i hope at least
that he is alway a sportsman permit me here and now to swear as
a christian and promis as a good comrad and a fellow-artist
that i will not report anyth of thi whatev it is to the
polic and now in the name of colney hatch what is it?

i think said gregori with placid irrelev that we will
call a cab

he gave two long whistl and a hansom came rattl down the
road the two got into it in silenc gregori gave through the
trap the address of an obscur public-hous on the chiswick bank
of the river the cab whisk itself away again and in it these
two fantast quit their fantast town



chapter ii

the secret of gabriel syme

the cab pull up befor a particularli dreari and greasi beershop
into which gregori rapidli conduct hi companion they seat
themselv in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour at a stain
wooden tabl with one wooden leg the room wa so small and dark
that veri littl could be seen of the attend who wa summon
beyond a vagu and dark impress of someth bulki and beard

will you take a littl supper? ask gregori polit the pate
de foie gra is not good here but i can recommend the game

syme receiv the remark with stolid imagin it to be a joke
accept the vein of humour he said with a well-br
indifference--

oh bring me some lobster mayonnais

to hi indescrib astonish the man onli said certainli
sir! and went away appar to get it

what will you drink? resum gregori with the same careless yet
apologet air i shall onli have a crepe de menth myself; i have
dine but the champagn can realli be trust do let me start you
with a half-bottl of pommeri at least?

thank you! said the motionless syme you are veri good

hi further attempt at convers somewhat disorganis in
themselv were cut short final as by a thunderbolt by the
actual appear of the lobster syme tast it and found it
particularli good then he suddenli began to eat with great
rapid and appetit

excus me if i enjoy myself rather obviously! he said to gregori
smile i dont often have the luck to have a dream like thi it
is new to me for a nightmar to lead to a lobster it is commonli
the other way

you are not asleep i assur you said gregori you are on the
contrari close to the most actual and rous moment of your
exist ah here come your champagne! i admit that there may be
a slight disproport let us say between the inner arrang
of thi excel hotel and it simpl and unpretenti exterior
but that is all our modesti we are the most modest men that ever
live on earth

and who are we? ask syme empti hi champagn glass

it is quit simpl repli gregori we are the seriou
anarchist in whom you do not believ

oh! said syme shortli you do yourselv well in drink

ye we are seriou about everyth answer gregori

then after a paus he added--

if in a few moment thi tabl begin to turn round a littl
dont put it down to your inroad into the champagn i dont wish
you to do yourself an injustic

well if i am not drunk i am mad repli syme with perfect
calm; but i trust i can behav like a gentleman in either
condit may i smoke?

certainly! said gregori produc a cigar-cas tri one of
mine

syme took the cigar clip the end off with a cigar-cutt out
of hi waistcoat pocket put it in hi mouth lit it slowli and
let out a long cloud of smoke it is not a littl to hi credit
that he perform these rite with so much composur for almost
befor he had begun them the tabl at which he sat had begun to
revolv first slowli and then rapidli as if at an insan
seanc

you must not mind it said gregory; it a kind of screw

quit so said syme placidli a kind of screw how simpl that
is!

the next moment the smoke of hi cigar which had been waver
across the room in snaki twist went straight up as if from a
factori chimney and the two with their chair and tabl shot
down through the floor as if the earth had swallow them they
went rattl down a kind of roar chimney as rapidli as a lift
cut loos and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom but
when gregori threw open a pair of door and let in a red
subterranean light syme wa still smoke with one leg thrown
over the other and had not turn a yellow hair

gregori led him down a low vault passag at the end of which
wa the red light it wa an enorm crimson lantern nearli as
big as a fireplac fix over a small but heavi iron door in the
door there wa a sort of hatchway or grate and on thi gregori
struck five time a heavi voic with a foreign accent ask him
who he wa to thi he gave the more or less unexpect repli
mr joseph chamberlain the heavi hing began to move; it wa
obvious some kind of password

insid the doorway the passag gleam as if it were line with a
network of steel on a second glanc syme saw that the glitter
pattern wa realli made up of rank and rank of rifl and
revolv close pack or interlock

i must ask you to forgiv me all these formal said gregory;
we have to be veri strict here

oh dont apologis said syme i know your passion for law and
order and he step into the passag line with the steel
weapon with hi long fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat he
look a singularli frail and fanci figur as he walk down
that shine avenu of death

they pass through sever such passag and came out at last
into a queer steel chamber with curv wall almost spheric in
shape but present with it tier of bench someth of the
appear of a scientif lecture-theatr there were no rifl or
pistol in thi apart but round the wall of it were hung more
dubiou and dread shape thing that look like the bulb of
iron plant or the egg of iron bird they were bomb and the
veri room itself seem like the insid of a bomb syme knock hi
cigar ash off against the wall and went in

and now my dear mr syme said gregori throw himself in an
expans manner on the bench under the largest bomb now we are
quit cosi so let us talk properli now no human word can give
you ani notion of whi i brought you here it wa one of those quit
arbitrari emot like jump off a cliff or fall in love
suffic it to say that you were an inexpress irrit fellow
and to do you justic you are still i would break twenti oath
of secreci for the pleasur of take you down a peg that way you
have of light a cigar would make a priest break the seal of
confess well you said that you were quit certain i wa not a
seriou anarchist doe thi place strike you as be serious?

it doe seem to have a moral under all it gaieti assent
syme; but may i ask you two questions? you need not fear to give
me inform becaus as you rememb you veri wise extort
from me a promis not to tell the polic a promis i shall
certainli keep so it is in mere curios that i make my queri
first of all what is it realli all about? what is it you object
to? you want to abolish government?

to abolish god! said gregori open the eye of a fanat we
do not onli want to upset a few despot and polic regulations;
that sort of anarch doe exist but it is a mere branch of the
nonconformist we dig deeper and we blow you higher we wish to
deni all those arbitrari distinct of vice and virtu honour
and treacheri upon which mere rebel base themselv the silli
sentimentalist of the french revolut talk of the right of
man! we hate right as we hate wrong we have abolish right and
wrong

and right and left said syme with a simpl eager i hope
you will abolish them too they are much more troublesom to me

you spoke of a second question snap gregori

with pleasur resum syme in all your present act and
surround there is a scientif attempt at secreci i have an
aunt who live over a shop but thi is the first time i have
found peopl live from prefer under a public-hous you have
a heavi iron door you cannot pass it without submit to the
humili of call yourself mr chamberlain you surround
yourself with steel instrument which make the place if i may say
so more impress than homelik may i ask whi after take all
thi troubl to barricad yourselv in the bowel of the earth
you then parad your whole secret by talk about anarch to
everi silli woman in saffron park?

gregori smile

the answer is simpl he said i told you i wa a seriou
anarchist and you did not believ me nor do they believ me
unless i took them into thi infern room they would not believ
me

syme smoke thought and look at him with interest gregori
went on

the histori of the thing might amus you he said when first i
becam one of the new anarchist i tri all kind of respect
disguis i dress up as a bishop i read up all about bishop
in our anarchist pamphlet in superstit the vampir and
priest of prey i certainli understood from them that bishop are
strang and terribl old men keep a cruel secret from mankind
i wa misinform when on my first appear in episcop gaiter
in a drawing-room i cri out in a voic of thunder down! down!
presumptu human reason! they found out in some way that i wa
not a bishop at all i wa nab at onc then i made up as a
millionaire; but i defend capit with so much intellig that
a fool could see that i wa quit poor then i tri be a
major now i am a humanitarian myself but i have i hope enough
intellectu breadth to understand the posit of those who like
nietzsch admir violence--th proud mad war of natur and all
that you know i threw myself into the major i drew my sword and
wave it constantli i call out blood! abstractedli like a
man call for wine i often said let the weak perish; it is
the law well well it seem major dont do thi i wa nab
again at last i went in despair to the presid of the central
anarchist council who is the greatest man in europ

what is hi name? ask syme

you would not know it answer gregori that is hi great
caesar and napoleon put all their geniu into be heard of and
they were heard of he put all hi geniu into not be heard of
and he is not heard of but you cannot be for five minut in the
room with him without feel that caesar and napoleon would have
been children in hi hand

he wa silent and even pale for a moment and then resumed--

but whenev he give advic it is alway someth as startl
as an epigram and yet as practic as the bank of england i said
to him what disguis will hide me from the world? what can i find
more respect than bishop and majors? he look at me with hi
larg but indecipher face you want a safe disguis do you?
you want a dress which will guarante you harmless; a dress in
which no one would ever look for a bomb? i nod he suddenli
lift hi lion voic whi then dress up as an anarchist you
fool! he roar so that the room shook nobodi will ever expect
you to do anyth danger then and he turn hi broad back
on me without anoth word i took hi advic and have never
regret it i preach blood and murder to those women day and
night and--bi god!--they would let me wheel their perambul

syme sat watch him with some respect in hi larg blue eye

you took me in he said it is realli a smart dodg

then after a paus he added--

what do you call thi tremend presid of yours?

chapter iii

the man who wa thursday

befor one of the fresh face could appear at the doorway
gregori stun surpris had fallen from him he wa besid the
tabl with a bound and a nois in hi throat like a wild beast
he caught up the colt revolv and took aim at syme syme did
not flinch but he put up a pale and polit hand

dont be such a silli man he said with the effemin digniti
of a curat dont you see it not necessary? dont you see that
were both in the same boat? ye and jolli sea-sick

gregori could not speak but he could not fire either and he
look hi question

dont you see weve checkmat each other? cri syme i cant
tell the polic you are an anarchist you cant tell the anarchist
im a policeman i can onli watch you know what you are; you
can onli watch me know what i am in short it a lone
intellectu duel my head against your im a policeman depriv
of the help of the polic you my poor fellow are an anarchist
depriv of the help of that law and organis which is so
essenti to anarchi the one solitari differ is in your
favour you are not surround by inquisit policemen; i am
surround by inquisit anarchist i cannot betray you but i
might betray myself come come! wait and see me betray myself i
shall do it so nice

gregori put the pistol slowli down still stare at syme as if he
were a sea-monst

i dont believ in immort he said at last but if after
all thi you were to break your word god would make a hell onli
for you to howl in for ever

i shall not break my word said syme sternli nor will you
break your here are your friend

the mass of the anarchist enter the room heavili with a
slouch and somewhat weari gait; but one littl man with a
black beard and glasses--a man somewhat of the type of mr tim
healy--detach himself and bustl forward with some paper
in hi hand

comrad gregori he said i suppos thi man is a delegate?

gregori taken by surpris look down and mutter the name of
syme; but syme repli almost pertly--

i am glad to see that your gate is well enough guard to make it
hard for anyon to be here who wa not a deleg

the brow of the littl man with the black beard wa howev still
contract with someth like suspicion

what branch do you represent? he ask sharpli

i should hardli call it a branch said syme laughing; i should
call it at the veri least a root

what do you mean?

the fact is said syme seren the truth is i am a
sabbatarian i have been special sent here to see that you show
a due observ of sunday

the littl man drop one of hi paper and a flicker of fear
went over all the face of the group evid the aw
presid whose name wa sunday did sometim send down such
irregular ambassador to such branch meet

well comrad said the man with the paper after a paus i
suppos wed better give you a seat in the meeting?

if you ask my advic as a friend said syme with sever
benevol i think youd better

when gregori heard the danger dialogu end with a sudden safeti
for hi rival he rose abruptli and pace the floor in pain
thought he wa inde in an agoni of diplomaci it wa clear
that syme inspir impud wa like to bring him out of all
mere accident dilemma littl wa to be hope from them he
could not himself betray syme partli from honour but partli also
becaus if he betray him and for some reason fail to destroy
him the syme who escap would be a syme freed from all oblig
of secreci a syme who would simpli walk to the nearest polic
station after all it wa onli one night discuss and onli
one detect who would know of it he would let out as littl as
possibl of their plan that night and then let syme go and
chanc it

he strode across to the group of anarchist which wa alreadi
distribut itself along the bench

i think it is time we began he said; the steam-tug is wait
on the river alreadi i move that comrad button take the chair

thi be approv by a show of hand the littl man with the
paper slip into the presidenti seat

comrad he began as sharp as a pistol-shot our meet
tonight is import though it need not be long thi branch
ha alway had the honour of elect thursday for the central
european council we have elect mani and splendid thursday we
all lament the sad deceas of the heroic worker who occupi the
post until last week as you know hi servic to the caus were
consider he organis the great dynamit coup of brighton
which under happier circumst ought to have kill everybodi
on the pier as you also know hi death wa as self-deni as
hi life for he die through hi faith in a hygien mixtur of
chalk and water as a substitut for milk which beverag he
regard as barbar and as involv cruelti to the cow
cruelti or anyth approach to cruelti revolt him alway
but it is not to acclaim hi virtu that we are met but for a
harder task it is difficult properli to prais hi qualiti but
it is more difficult to replac them upon you comrad it
devolv thi even to choos out of the compani present the man
who shall be thursday if ani comrad suggest a name i will put
it to the vote if no comrad suggest a name i can onli tell
myself that that dear dynamit who is gone from us ha carri
into the unknow abyss the last secret of hi virtu and hi
innoc

there wa a stir of almost inaud applaus such as is sometim
heard in church then a larg old man with a long and vener
white beard perhap the onli real working-man present rose
lumberingli and said--

i move that comrad gregori be elect thursday and sat
lumberingli down again

doe anyon second? ask the chairman

a littl man with a velvet coat and point beard second

befor i put the matter to the vote said the chairman i will
call on comrad gregori to make a statement

gregori rose amid a great rumbl of applaus hi face wa deadli
pale so that by contrast hi queer red hair look almost scarlet
but he wa smile and altogeth at eas he had made up hi mind
and he saw hi best polici quit plain in front of him like a white
road hi best chanc wa to make a soften and ambigu speech
such as would leav on the detect mind the impress that the
anarchist brotherhood wa a veri mild affair after all he believ
in hi own literari power hi capac for suggest fine shade
and pick perfect word he thought that with care he could
succeed in spite of all the peopl around him in convey an
impress of the institut subtli and delic fals syme
had onc thought that anarchist under all their bravado were
onli play the fool could he not now in the hour of peril make
syme think so again?

comrad began gregori in a low but penetr voic it is
not necessari for me to tell you what is my polici for it is your
polici also our belief ha been slander it ha been disfigur
it ha been utterli confus and conceal but it ha never been
alter those who talk about anarch and it danger go
everywher and anywher to get their inform except to us
except to the fountain head they learn about anarchist from
sixpenni novels; they learn about anarchist from tradesmen
newspapers; they learn about anarchist from alli sloper
half-holiday and the sport time they never learn about
anarchist from anarchist we have no chanc of deni the
mountain slander which are heap upon our head from one end
of europ to anoth the man who ha alway heard that we are
walk plagu ha never heard our repli i know that he will not
hear it tonight though my passion were to rend the roof for it is
deep deep under the earth that the persecut are permit to
assembl as the christian assembl in the catacomb but if by
some incred accid there were here tonight a man who all hi
life had thu immens misunderstood us i would put thi question
to him: when those christian met in those catacomb what sort of
moral reput had they in the street above? what tale were
told of their atroc by one educ roman to another? suppos
(i would say to him) suppos that we are onli repeat that
still mysteri paradox of histori suppos we seem as shock as
the christian becaus we are realli as harmless as the christian
suppos we seem as mad as the christian becaus we are realli as
meek

the applaus that had greet the open sentenc had been
gradual grow fainter and at the last word it stop
suddenli in the abrupt silenc the man with the velvet jacket
said in a high squeaki voice--

im not meek!

comrad witherspoon tell us resum gregori that he is not
meek ah how littl he know himself! hi word are inde
extravagant; hi appear is feroci and even (to an ordinari
taste) unattract but onli the eye of a friendship as deep and
delic as mine can perceiv the deep foundat of solid meek
which lie at the base of him too deep even for himself to see i
repeat we are the true earli christian onli that we come too
late we are simpl as they rever simple--look at comrad
witherspoon we are modest as they were modest--look at me we are
merciful--

no no! call out mr witherspoon with the velvet jacket

i say we are merci repeat gregori furious as the earli
christian were merci yet thi did not prevent their be
accus of eat human flesh we do not eat human flesh--

shame! cri witherspoon whi not?

comrad witherspoon said gregori with a feverish gaieti is
anxiou to know whi nobodi eat him (laughter) in our societi at
ani rate which love him sincer which is found upon love--

no no! said witherspoon down with love

which is found upon love repeat gregori grind hi teeth
there will be no difficulti about the aim which we shall pursu
as a bodi or which i should pursu were i chosen as the
repres of that bodi superbl careless of the slander that
repres us as assassin and enemi of human societi we shall
pursu with moral courag and quiet intellectu pressur the
perman ideal of brotherhood and simplic

gregori resum hi seat and pass hi hand across hi forehead
the silenc wa sudden and awkward but the chairman rose like an
automaton and said in a colourless voice--

doe anyon oppos the elect of comrad gregory?

the assembl seem vagu and sub-consci disappoint and
comrad witherspoon move restlessli on hi seat and mutter in
hi thick beard by the sheer rush of routin howev the motion
would have been put and carri but as the chairman wa open
hi mouth to put it syme sprang to hi feet and said in a small
and quiet voice--

ye mr chairman i oppos

the most effect fact in oratori is an unexpect chang in the
voic mr gabriel syme evid understood oratori have said
these first formal word in a moder tone and with a brief
simplic he made hi next word ring and volley in the vault as
if one of the gun had gone off

comrades! he cri in a voic that made everi man jump out of
hi boot have we come here for this? do we live underground like
rat in order to listen to talk like this? thi is talk we might
listen to while eat bun at a sunday school treat do we line
these wall with weapon and bar that door with death lest anyon
should come and hear comrad gregori say to us be good and
you will be happi honesti is the best polici and virtu is
it own reward? there wa not a word in comrad gregori address
to which a curat could not have listen with pleasur (hear
hear) but i am not a curat (loud cheers) and i did not listen to
it with pleasur (renew cheers) the man who is fit to make a
good curat is not fit to make a resolut forcibl and
effici thursday (hear hear)

comrad gregori ha told us in onli too apologet a tone that
we are not the enemi of societi but i say that we are the
enemi of societi and so much the wors for societi we are the
enemi of societi for societi is the enemi of human it
oldest and it most pitiless enemi (hear hear) comrad gregori
ha told us (apologet again) that we are not murder there
i agre we are not murder we are execution (cheers)

ever sinc syme had risen gregori had sat stare at him hi face
idiot with astonish now in the paus hi lip of clay
part and he said with an automat and lifeless distinctness--

you damnabl hypocrite!

syme look straight into those fright eye with hi own pale
blue one and said with dignity--

comrad gregori accus me of hypocrisi he know as well as i do
that i am keep all my engag and do noth but my duti
i do not minc word i do not pretend to i say that comrad
gregori is unfit to be thursday for all hi amiabl qualiti he
is unfit to be thursday becaus of hi amiabl qualiti we do not
want the suprem council of anarchi infect with a maudlin merci
(hear hear) thi is no time for ceremoni polit neither is
it a time for ceremoni modesti i set myself against comrad
gregori as i would set myself against all the govern of
europ becaus the anarchist who ha given himself to anarchi ha
forgotten modesti as much as he ha forgotten pride (cheers) i am
not a man at all i am a caus (renew cheers) i set myself
against comrad gregori as imperson and as calmli as i should
choos one pistol rather than anoth out of that rack upon the
wall; and i say that rather than have gregori and hi
milk-and-wat method on the suprem council i would offer myself
for election--

hi sentenc wa drown in a deafen cataract of applaus the
face that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approv as hi
tirad grew more and more uncompromis were now distort with
grin of anticip or cloven with delight cri at the
moment when he announc himself as readi to stand for the post of
thursday a roar of excit and assent broke forth and becam
uncontrol and at the same moment gregori sprang to hi feet
with foam upon hi mouth and shout against the shout

stop you blast madmen! he cri at the top of a voic that
tore hi throat stop you--

but louder than gregori shout and louder than the roar of the
room came the voic of syme still speak in a peal of pitiless
thunder--

i do not go to the council to rebut that slander that call us
murderers; i go to earn it (loud and prolong cheering) to the
priest who say these men are the enemi of religion to the
judg who say these men are the enemi of law to the fat
parliamentarian who say these men are the enemi of order and
public decenc to all these i will repli you are fals king
but you are true prophet i am come to destroy you and to fulfil
your propheci

the heavi clamour gradual die away but befor it had ceas
witherspoon had jump to hi feet hi hair and beard all on end
and had said--

i move as an amend that comrad syme be appoint to the post

stop all thi i tell you! cri gregori with frantic face and
hand stop it it is all--

the voic of the chairman clove hi speech with a cold accent

doe anyon second thi amendment? he said a tall tire man
with melancholi eye and an american chin beard wa observ on
the back bench to be slowli rise to hi feet gregori had been
scream for some time past; now there wa a chang in hi accent
more shock than ani scream i end all this! he said in a
voic as heavi as stone

thi man cannot be elect he is a--

ye said syme quit motionless what is he? gregori mouth
work twice without sound; then slowli the blood began to crawl
back into hi dead face he is a man quit inexperienc in our
work he said and sat down abruptli

befor he had done so the long lean man with the american beard
wa again upon hi feet and wa repeat in a high american
monotone--

i beg to second the elect of comrad syme

the amend will as usual be put first said mr button the
chairman with mechan rapid

the question is that comrad syme--

gregori had again sprung to hi feet pant and passion

comrad he cri out i am not a madman

oh oh! said mr witherspoon

i am not a madman reiter gregori with a fright sincer
which for a moment stagger the room but i give you a counsel
which you can call mad if you like no i will not call it a
counsel for i can give you no reason for it i will call it a
command call it a mad command but act upon it strike but hear
me! kill me but obey me! do not elect thi man truth is so
terribl even in fetter that for a moment syme slender and
insan victori sway like a reed but you could not have guess
it from syme bleak blue eye he mere began--

comrad gregori commands--

then the spell wa snap and one anarchist call out to gregory--

who are you? you are not sunday; and anoth anarchist ad in a
heavier voic and you are not thursday

comrad cri gregori in a voic like that of a martyr who in
an ecstaci of pain ha pass beyond pain it is noth to me
whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave if you
will not take my command accept my degrad i kneel to you i
throw myself at your feet i implor you do not elect thi man

comrad gregori said the chairman after a pain paus thi
is realli not quit dignifi

for the first time in the proceed there wa for a few second a
real silenc then gregori fell back in hi seat a pale wreck of a
man and the chairman repeat like a piec of clock-work suddenli
start again--

the question is that comrad syme be elect to the post of
thursday on the gener council

the roar rose like the sea the hand rose like a forest and three
minut afterward mr gabriel syme of the secret polic servic
wa elect to the post of thursday on the gener council of the
anarchist of europ

everyon in the room seem to feel the tug wait on the river
the sword-stick and the revolv wait on the tabl the instant
the elect wa end and irrevoc and syme had receiv the
paper prove hi elect they all sprang to their feet and the
fieri group move and mix in the room syme found himself
somehow or other face to face with gregori who still regard him
with a stare of stun hatr they were silent for mani minut

you are a devil! said gregori at last

and you are a gentleman said syme with graviti

it wa you that entrap me began gregori shake from head
to foot entrap me into--

talk sens said syme shortli into what sort of devil
parliament have you entrap me if it come to that? you made me
swear befor i made you perhap we are both do what we think
right but what we think right is so damn differ that there
can be noth between us in the way of concess there is
noth possibl between us but honour and death and he pull
the great cloak about hi shoulder and pick up the flask from
the tabl

the boat is quit readi said mr button bustl up be good
enough to step thi way

with a gestur that reveal the shop-walk he led syme down a
short iron-bound passag the still agonis gregori follow
feverishli at their heel at the end of the passag wa a door
which button open sharpli show a sudden blue and silver
pictur of the moonlit river that look like a scene in a
theatr close to the open lay a dark dwarfish steam-launch
like a babi dragon with one red eye

almost in the act of step on board gabriel syme turn to the
gape gregori

you have kept your word he said gentli with hi face in shadow
you are a man of honour and i thank you you have kept it even
down to a small particular there wa one special thing you
promis me at the begin of the affair and which you have
certainli given me by the end of it

what do you mean? cri the chaotic gregori what did i promis
you?

a veri entertain even said syme and he made a militari
salut with the sword-stick as the steamboat slid away



chapter iv

the tale of a detect

gabriel syme wa not mere a detect who pretend to be a poet;
he wa realli a poet who had becom a detect nor wa hi hatr
of anarchi hypocrit he wa one of those who are driven earli
in life into too conserv an attitud by the bewild folli
of most revolutionist he had not attain it by ani tame
tradit hi respect wa spontan and sudden a
rebellion against rebellion he came of a famili of crank in
which all the oldest peopl had all the newest notion one of hi
uncl alway walk about without a hat and anoth had made an
unsuccess attempt to walk about with a hat and noth els hi
father cultiv art and self-realisation; hi mother went in for
simplic and hygien henc the child dure hi tender year
wa wholli unacquaint with ani drink between the extrem of
absinth and cocoa of both of which he had a healthi dislik the
more hi mother preach a more than puritan abstin the more
did hi father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the
time the former had come to enforc vegetarian the latter had
pretti well reach the point of defend cannib

be surround with everi conceiv kind of revolt from
infanc gabriel had to revolt into someth so he revolt into
the onli thing left--san but there wa just enough in him of
the blood of these fanat to make even hi protest for common
sens a littl too fierc to be sensibl hi hatr of modern
lawless had been crown also by an accid it happen that
he wa walk in a side street at the instant of a dynamit
outrag he had been blind and deaf for a moment and then seen
the smoke clear the broken window and the bleed face
after that he went about as usual--quiet courteou rather gentle;
but there wa a spot on hi mind that wa not sane he did not
regard anarchist as most of us do as a hand of morbid men
combin ignor with intellectu he regard them as a
huge and pitiless peril like a chines invas

he pour perpetu into newspap and their waste-pap basket
a torrent of tale vers and violent articl warn men of
thi delug of barbar denial but he seem to be get no
nearer hi enemi and what wa wors no nearer a live as he
pace the thame embank bitterli bite a cheap cigar and
brood on the advanc of anarchi there wa no anarchist with
a bomb in hi pocket so savag or so solitari as he inde he
alway felt that govern stood alon and desper with it
back to the wall he wa too quixot to have care for it
otherwis

he walk on the embank onc under a dark red sunset the red
river reflect the red sky and they both reflect hi anger the
sky inde wa so swarthi and the light on the river rel
so lurid that the water almost seem of fiercer flame than the
sunset it mirror it look like a stream of liter fire wind
under the vast cavern of a subterranean countri

syme wa shabbi in those day he wore an old-fashion black
chimney-pot hat; he wa wrap in a yet more old-fashion cloak
black and ragged; and the combin gave him the look of the
earli villain in dicken and bulwer lytton also hi yellow beard
and hair were more unkempt and leonin than when they appear long
afterward cut and point on the lawn of saffron park a long
lean black cigar bought in soho for twopenc stood out from
between hi tighten teeth and altogeth he look a veri
satisfactori specimen of the anarchist upon whom he had vow a
holi war perhap thi wa whi a policeman on the embank spoke
to him and said good even

syme at a crisi of hi morbid fear for human seem stung by
the mere stolid of the automat offici a mere bulk of blue
in the twilight

a good even is it? he said sharpli you fellow would call
the end of the world a good even look at that bloodi red sun
and that bloodi river! i tell you that if that were liter human
blood spilt and shine you would still be stand here as solid
as ever look out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could
move on you policemen are cruel to the poor but i could forgiv
you even your cruelti if it were not for your calm

if we are calm repli the policeman it is the calm of
organis resist

eh? said syme stare

the soldier must be calm in the thick of the battl pursu the
policeman the composur of an armi is the anger of a nation

good god the board schools! said syme is thi undenomin
education?

no said the policeman sadli i never had ani of those
advantag the board school came after my time what educ
i had wa veri rough and old-fashion i am afraid

where did you have it? ask syme wonder

oh at harrow said the policeman

the class sympathi which fals as they are are the truest
thing in so mani men broke out of syme befor he could control
them

but good lord man he said you oughtnt to be a policeman!

the policeman sigh and shook hi head

i know he said solemnli i know i am not worthi

but whi did you join the police? ask syme with rude curios

for much the same reason that you abus the polic repli the
other i found that there wa a special open in the servic for
those whose fear for human were concern rather with the
aberr of the scientif intellect than with the normal and
excus though excess outbreak of the human will i trust
i make myself clear

if you mean that you make your opinion clear said syme i
suppos you do but as for make yourself clear it is the last
thing you do how come a man like you to be talk philosophi
in a blue helmet on the thame embankment?

you have evid not heard of the latest develop in our
polic system repli the other i am not surpris at it we
are keep it rather dark from the educ class becaus that
class contain most of our enemi but you seem to be exactli in
the right frame of mind i think you might almost join us

join you in what? ask syme

i will tell you said the policeman slowli thi is the
situation: the head of one of our depart one of the most
celebr detect in europ ha long been of opinion that a
pure intellectu conspiraci would soon threaten the veri
exist of civilis he is certain that the scientif and
artist world are silent bound in a crusad against the famili
and the state he ha therefor form a special corp of
policemen policemen who are also philosoph it is their
busi to watch the begin of thi conspiraci not mere in
a crimin but in a controversi sens i am a democrat myself
and i am fulli awar of the valu of the ordinari man in matter of
ordinari valour or virtu but it would obvious be undesir to
employ the common policeman in an investig which is also a
heresi hunt

syme eye were bright with a sympathet curios

what do you do then? he said

the work of the philosoph policeman repli the man in
blue is at onc bolder and more subtl than that of the ordinari
detect the ordinari detect goe to pot-hous to arrest
thieves; we go to artist tea-parti to detect pessimist the
ordinari detect discov from a ledger or a diari that a crime
ha been commit we discov from a book of sonnet that a crime
will be commit we have to trace the origin of those dread
thought that drive men on at last to intellectu fanatic and
intellectu crime we were onli just in time to prevent the
assassin at hartl pool and that wa entir due to the fact
that our mr wilk (a smart young fellow) thoroughli understood a
triolet

do you mean ask syme that there is realli as much connect
between crime and the modern intellect as all that?

you are not suffici democrat answer the policeman but
you were right when you said just now that our ordinari treatment
of the poor crimin wa a pretti brutal busi i tell you i am
sometim sick of my trade when i see how perpetu it mean
mere a war upon the ignor and the desper but thi new
movement of our is a veri differ affair we deni the snobbish
english assumpt that the uneduc are the danger crimin
we rememb the roman emperor we rememb the great poison
princ of the renaiss we say that the danger crimin is
the educ crimin we say that the most danger crimin now
is the entir lawless modern philosoph compar to him
burglar and bigamist are essenti moral men; my heart goe out
to them they accept the essenti ideal of man; they mere seek
it wrongli thiev respect properti they mere wish the properti
to becom their properti that they may more perfectli respect it
but philosoph dislik properti as property; they wish to destroy
the veri idea of person possess bigamist respect marriag
or they would not go through the highli ceremoni and even
ritualist formal of bigami but philosoph despis marriag
as marriag murder respect human life; they mere wish to
attain a greater ful of human life in themselv by the
sacrific of what seem to them to be lesser live but
philosoph hate life itself their own as much as other
peopl

syme struck hi hand togeth

how true that is he cri i have felt it from my boyhood but
never could state the verbal antithesi the common crimin is a
bad man but at least he is as it were a condit good man
he say that if onli a certain obstacl be removed--say a wealthi
uncle--h is then prepar to accept the univers and to prais
god he is a reform but not an anarchist he wish to cleans
the edific but not to destroy it but the evil philosoph is
not tri to alter thing but to annihil them ye the
modern world ha retain all those part of polic work which are
realli oppress and ignomini the harri of the poor the
spi upon the unfortun it ha given up it more dignifi
work the punish of power traitor the in the state and
power heresiarch in the church the modern say we must not
punish heret my onli doubt is whether we have a right to
punish anybodi els

but thi is absurd! cri the policeman clasp hi hand with
an excit uncommon in person of hi figur and costum but
it is intolerable! i dont know what your do but your
wast your life you must you shall join our special armi
against anarchi their armi are on our frontier their bolt
is readi to fall a moment more and you may lose the glori of
work with us perhap the glori of die with the last hero
of the world

it is a chanc not to be miss certainli assent syme but
still i do not quit understand i know as well as anybodi that
the modern world is full of lawless littl men and mad littl
movement but beastli as they are they gener have the one
merit of disagre with each other how can you talk of their
lead one armi or hurl one bolt what is thi anarchy?

do not confus it repli the constabl with those chanc
dynamit outbreak from russia or from ireland which are realli
the outbreak of oppress if mistaken men thi is a vast
philosoph movement consist of an outer and an inner ring
you might even call the outer ring the laiti and the inner ring
the priesthood i prefer to call the outer ring the innoc
section the inner ring the suprem guilti section the outer
ring--th main mass of their supporters--ar mere anarchists;
that is men who believ that rule and formula have destroy
human happi they believ that all the evil result of human
crime are the result of the system that ha call it crime they
do not believ that the crime creat the punish they believ
that the punish ha creat the crime they believ that if a
man seduc seven women he would natur walk away as blameless
as the flower of spring they believ that if a man pick a
pocket he would natur feel exquisit good these i call the
innoc section

oh! said syme

natur therefor these peopl talk about a happi time
coming; the paradis of the future; mankind freed from the
bondag of vice and the bondag of virtu and so on and so also
the men of the inner circl speak--th sacr priesthood they
also speak to applaud crowd of the happi of the futur
and of mankind freed at last but in their mouths--and the
policeman lower hi voice--in their mouth these happi phrase
have a horribl mean they are under no illusions; they are too
intellectu to think that man upon thi earth can ever be quit
free of origin sin and the struggl and they mean death when
they say that mankind shall be free at last they mean that
mankind shall commit suicid when they talk of a paradis without
right or wrong they mean the grave

they have but two object to destroy first human and then
themselv that is whi they throw bomb instead of fire pistol
the innoc rank and file are disappoint becaus the bomb ha
not kill the king; but the high-priesthood are happi becaus it
ha kill somebodi

how can i join you? ask syme with a sort of passion

i know for a fact that there is a vacanc at the moment said the
policeman as i have the honour to be somewhat in the confid
of the chief of whom i have spoken you should realli come and see
him or rather i should not say see him nobodi ever see him; but
you can talk to him if you like

telephone? inquir syme with interest

no said the policeman placidli he ha a fanci for alway
sit in a pitch-dark room he say it make hi thought
brighter do come along

somewhat daze and consider excit syme allow himself to be
led to a side-door in the long row of build of scotland yard
almost befor he knew what he wa do he had been pass through
the hand of about four intermedi offici and wa suddenli
shown into a room the abrupt black of which startl him like
a blaze of light it wa not the ordinari dark in which form
can be faintli traced; it wa like go suddenli stone-blind

are you the new recruit? ask a heavi voic

and in some strang way though there wa not the shadow of a shape
in the gloom syme knew two things: first that it came from a man
of massiv stature; and second that the man had hi back to him

are you the new recruit? said the invis chief who seem to
have heard all about it all right you are engag

syme quit swept off hi feet made a feebl fight against thi
irrevoc phrase

i realli have no experi he began

no one ha ani experi said the other of the battl of
armageddon

but i am realli unfit--

you are will that is enough said the unknown

well realli said syme i dont know ani profess of which
mere willing is the final test

i do said the other--martyr i am condemn you to death
good day

thu it wa that when gabriel syme came out again into the crimson
light of even in hi shabbi black hat and shabbi lawless
cloak he came out a member of the new detect corp for the
frustrat of the great conspiraci act under the advic of hi
friend the policeman (who wa profession inclin to neatness)
he trim hi hair and beard bought a good hat clad himself in
an exquisit summer suit of light blue-grey with a pale yellow
flower in the button-hol and in short becam that eleg and
rather insupport person whom gregori had first encount in
the littl garden of saffron park befor he final left the
polic premis hi friend provid him with a small blue card
on which wa written the last crusad and a number the sign
of hi offici author he put thi care in hi upper
waistcoat pocket lit a cigarett and went forth to track and
fight the enemi in all the drawing-room of london where hi
adventur ultim led him we have alreadi seen at about
half-past one on a februari night he found himself steam in a
small tug up the silent thame arm with swordstick and revolv
the duli elect thursday of the central council of anarchist

when syme step out on to the steam-tug he had a singular
sensat of step out into someth entir new; not mere
into the landscap of a new land but even into the landscap of a
new planet thi wa mainli due to the insan yet solid decis of
that even though partli also to an entir chang in the weather
and the sky sinc he enter the littl tavern some two hour
befor everi trace of the passion plumag of the cloudi sunset
had been swept away and a nake moon stood in a nake sky the
moon wa so strong and full that (bi a paradox often to be noticed)
it seem like a weaker sun it gave not the sens of bright
moonshin but rather of a dead daylight

over the whole landscap lay a lumin and unnatur
discolor as of that disastr twilight which milton spoke
of as shed by the sun in eclipse; so that syme fell easili into
hi first thought that he wa actual on some other and emptier
planet which circl round some sadder star but the more he felt
thi glitter desol in the moonlit land the more hi own
chivalr folli glow in the night like a great fire even the
common thing he carri with him--th food and the brandi and the
load pistol--took on exactli that concret and materi poetri
which a child feel when he take a gun upon a journey or a bun
with him to bed the sword-stick and the brandy-flask though in
themselv onli the tool of morbid conspir becam the
express of hi own more healthi romanc the sword-stick
becam almost the sword of chivalri and the brandi the wine of
the stirrup-cup for even the most dehumanis modern fantasi
depend on some older and simpler figure; the adventur may be
mad but the adventur must be sane the dragon without st
georg would not even be grotesqu so thi inhuman landscap wa
onli imagin by the presenc of a man realli human to syme
exagg mind the bright bleak hous and terrac by the
thame look as empti as the mountain of the moon but even the
moon is onli poetic becaus there is a man in the moon

the tug wa work by two men and with much toil went
compar slowli the clear moon that had lit up chiswick had
gone down by the time that they pass battersea and when they
came under the enorm bulk of westminst day had alreadi begun
to break it broke like the split of great bar of lead
show bar of silver; and these had brighten like white fire
when the tug chang it onward cours turn inward to a larg
land stage rather beyond chare cross

the great stone of the embank seem equal dark and gigant
as syme look up at them they were big and black against the huge
white dawn they made him feel that he wa land on the coloss
step of some egyptian palace; and inde the thing suit hi
mood for he wa in hi own mind mount to attack the solid
throne of horribl and heathen king he leapt out of the boat on
to one slimi step and stood a dark and slender figur amid the
enorm masonri the two men in the tug put her off again and
turn up stream they had never spoken a word



chapter v

the feast of fear

at first the larg stone stair seem to syme as desert as a
pyramid; but befor he reach the top he had realis that there
wa a man lean over the parapet of the embank and look
out across the river as a figur he wa quit convent clad
in a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal type of fashion;
he had a red flower in hi buttonhol as syme drew nearer to him
step by step he did not even move a hair; and syme could come
close enough to notic even in the dim pale morn light that
hi face wa long pale and intellectu and end in a small
triangular tuft of dark beard at the veri point of the chin all
els be clean-shaven thi scrap of hair almost seem a mere
oversight; the rest of the face wa of the type that is best
shaven--clear-cut ascet and in it way nobl syme drew closer
and closer note all thi and still the figur did not stir

at first an instinct had told syme that thi wa the man whom he
wa meant to meet then see that the man made no sign he had
conclud that he wa not and now again he had come back to a
certainti that the man had someth to do with hi mad adventur
for the man remain more still than would have been natur if a
stranger had come so close he wa as motionless as a wax-work
and got on the nerv somewhat in the same way syme look again
and again at the pale dignifi and delic face and the face
still look blankli across the river then he took out of hi
pocket the note from button prove hi elect and put it
befor that sad and beauti face then the man smile and hi
smile wa a shock for it wa all on one side go up in the
right cheek and down in the left

there wa noth ration speak to scare anyon about
thi mani peopl have thi nervou trick of a crook smile and
in mani it is even attract but in all syme circumst
with the dark dawn and the deadli errand and the loneli on the
great drip stone there wa someth unnerv in it

there wa the silent river and the silent man a man of even
classic face and there wa the last nightmar touch that hi
smile suddenli went wrong

the spasm of smile wa instantan and the man face drop
at onc into it harmoni melancholi he spoke without further
explan or inquiri like a man speak to an old colleagu

if we walk up toward leicest squar he said we shall just
be in time for breakfast sunday alway insist on an earli
breakfast have you had ani sleep?

no said syme

nor have i answer the man in an ordinari tone i shall tri to
get to bed after breakfast

he spoke with casual civil but in an utterli dead voic that
contradict the fanatic of hi face it seem almost as if all
friendli word were to him lifeless conveni and that hi onli
life wa hate after a paus the man spoke again

of cours the secretari of the branch told you everyth that
can be told but the one thing that can never be told is the last
notion of the presid for hi notion grow like a tropic
forest so in case you dont know id better tell you that he is
carri out hi notion of conceal ourselv by not conceal
ourselv to the most extraordinari length just now origin
of cours we met in a cell underground just as your branch doe
then sunday made us take a privat room at an ordinari restaur
he said that if you didnt seem to be hide nobodi hunt you out
well he is the onli man on earth i know; but sometim i realli
think that hi huge brain is go a littl mad in it old age for
now we flaunt ourselv befor the public we have our breakfast on
a balcony--on a balconi if you please--overlook leicest
squar

and what do the peopl say? ask syme

it quit simpl what they say answer hi guid

they say we are a lot of jolli gentlemen who pretend they are
anarchist

it seem to me a veri clever idea said syme

clever! god blast your impudence! clever! cri out the other in
a sudden shrill voic which wa as startl and discord as hi
crook smile when youv seen sunday for a split second youll
leav off call him clever

with thi they emerg out of a narrow street and saw the earli
sunlight fill leicest squar it will never be known i
suppos whi thi squar itself should look so alien and in some
way so continent it will never be known whether it wa the
foreign look that attract the foreign or the foreign who
gave it the foreign look but on thi particular morn the effect
seem singularli bright and clear between the open squar and the
sunlit leav and the statu and the saracen outlin of the
alhambra it look the replica of some french or even spanish
public place and thi effect increas in syme the sensat
which in mani shape he had had through the whole adventur the
eeri sensat of have stray into a new world as a fact he
had bought bad cigar round leicest squar ever sinc he wa a
boy but as he turn that corner and saw the tree and the
moorish cupola he could have sworn that he wa turn into an
unknown place de someth or other in some foreign town

at one corner of the squar there project a kind of angl of a
prosper but quiet hotel the bulk of which belong to a street
behind in the wall there wa one larg french window probabl
the window of a larg coffee-room; and outsid thi window almost
liter overhang the squar wa a formid buttress
balconi big enough to contain a dining-t in fact it did
contain a dining-t or more strictli a breakfast-table; and
round the breakfast-t glow in the sunlight and evid to
the street were a group of noisi and talk men all dress
in the insol of fashion with white waistcoat and expens
button-hol some of their joke could almost be heard across the
squar then the grave secretari gave hi unnatur smile and syme
knew that thi boister breakfast parti wa the secret conclav
of the european dynamit

then as syme continu to stare at them he saw someth that he
had not seen befor he had not seen it liter becaus it wa
too larg to see at the nearest end of the balconi block up a
great part of the perspect wa the back of a great mountain of
a man when syme had seen him hi first thought wa that the
weight of him must break down the balconi of stone hi vast
did not lie onli in the fact that he wa abnorm tall and quit
incred fat thi man wa plan enorm in hi origin
proport like a statu carv deliber as coloss hi
head crown with white hair as seen from behind look bigger
than a head ought to be the ear that stood out from it look
larger than human ear he wa enlarg terribl to scale; and thi
sens of size wa so stagger that when syme saw him all the
other figur seem quit suddenli to dwindl and becom dwarfish
they were still sit there as befor with their flower and
frock-coat but now it look as if the big man wa entertain
five children to tea

as syme and the guid approach the side door of the hotel a
waiter came out smile with everi tooth in hi head

the gentlemen are up there sare he said they do talk and they
do laugh at what they talk they do say they will throw bomb at ze
king

and the waiter hurri away with a napkin over hi arm much
pleas with the singular frivol of the gentlemen upstair

the two men mount the stair in silenc

syme had never thought of ask whether the monstrou man who
almost fill and broke the balconi wa the great presid of whom
the other stood in awe he knew it wa so with an unaccount
but instantan certainti syme inde wa one of those men who
are open to all the more nameless psycholog influenc in a
degre a littl danger to mental health utterli devoid of fear
in physic danger he wa a great deal too sensit to the smell
of spiritu evil twice alreadi that night littl unmean thing
had peep out at him almost prurient and given him a sens of
draw nearer and nearer to the head-quart of hell and thi
sens becam overpow as he drew nearer to the great presid

the form it took wa a childish and yet hate fanci as he walk
across the inner room toward the balconi the larg face of sunday
grew larger and larger; and syme wa grip with a fear that when
he wa quit close the face would be too big to be possibl and
that he would scream aloud he rememb that as a child he would
not look at the mask of memnon in the british museum becaus it
wa a face and so larg

by an effort braver than that of leap over a cliff he went to
an empti seat at the breakfast-t and sat down the men greet
him with good-humour railleri as if they had alway known him he
sober himself a littl by look at their convent coat and
solid shine coffee-pot; then he look again at sunday hi face
wa veri larg but it wa still possibl to human

in the presenc of the presid the whole compani look
suffici commonplace; noth about them caught the eye at
first except that by the presid capric they had been dress
up with a festiv respect which gave the meal the look of a
wed breakfast one man inde stood out at even a superfici
glanc he at least wa the common or garden dynamit he wore
inde the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform
of the occasion; but out of thi collar there sprang a head quit
unmanag and quit unmistak a bewild bush of brown
hair and beard that almost obscur the eye like those of a skye
terrier but the eye did look out of the tangl and they were the
sad eye of some russian serf the effect of thi figur wa not
terribl like that of the presid but it had everi diableri
that can come from the utterli grotesqu if out of that stiff tie
and collar there had come abruptli the head of a cat or a dog it
could not have been a more idiot contrast

the man name it seem wa gogol; he wa a pole and in thi
circl of day he wa call tuesday hi soul and speech were
incur tragic; he could not forc himself to play the
prosper and frivol part demand of him by presid sunday
and inde when syme came in the presid with that dare
disregard of public suspicion which wa hi polici wa actual
chaf gogol upon hi inabl to assum convent grace

our friend tuesday said the presid in a deep voic at onc
of quietud and volum our friend tuesday doesnt seem to grasp
the idea he dress up like a gentleman but he seem to be too
great a soul to behav like one he insist on the way of the
stage conspir now if a gentleman goe about london in a top
hat and a frock-coat no one need know that he is an anarchist
but if a gentleman put on a top hat and a frock-coat and then
goe about on hi hand and knees--wel he may attract attent
that what brother gogol doe he goe about on hi hand and
knee with such inexhaust diplomaci that by thi time he
find it quit difficult to walk upright

i am not good at gonceal said gogol sulkili with a thick
foreign accent; i am not asham of the caus

ye you are my boy and so is the caus of you said the
presid good-naturedli you hide as much as anybody; but you
cant do it you see your such an ass! you tri to combin two
inconsist method when a household find a man under hi
bed he will probabl paus to note the circumst but if he
find a man under hi bed in a top hat you will agre with me
my dear tuesday that he is not like even to forget it now
when you were found under admir biffin bed--

i am not good at decept said tuesday gloomili flush

right my boy right said the presid with a ponder
hearti you arent good at anyth

while thi stream of convers continu syme wa look
more steadili at the men around him as he did so he gradual
felt all hi sens of someth spiritu queer return

he had thought at first that they were all of common statur and
costum with the evid except of the hairi gogol but as he
look at the other he began to see in each of them exactli what
he had seen in the man by the river a demoniac detail somewher
that lop-sid laugh which would suddenli disfigur the fine
face of hi origin guid wa typic of all these type each
man had someth about him perceiv perhap at the tenth or
twentieth glanc which wa not normal and which seem hardli
human the onli metaphor he could think of wa thi that they
all look as men of fashion and presenc would look with the
addit twist given in a fals and curv mirror

onli the individu exampl will express thi half-conc
eccentr syme origin ciceron bore the titl of monday;
he wa the secretari of the council and hi twist smile wa
regard with more terror than anyth except the presid
horribl happi laughter but now that syme had more space and
light to observ him there were other touch hi fine face
wa so emaci that syme thought it must be wast with some
disease; yet somehow the veri distress of hi dark eye deni
thi it wa no physic ill that troubl him hi eye were
aliv with intellectu tortur as if pure thought wa pain

he wa typic of each of the tribe; each man wa subtli and
differ wrong next to him sat tuesday the tousle-head
gogol a man more obvious mad next wa wednesday a certain
marqui de st eustach a suffici characterist figur the
first few glanc found noth unusu about him except that he
wa the onli man at tabl who wore the fashion cloth as if
they were realli hi own he had a black french beard cut squar
and a black english frock-coat cut even squarer but syme
sensit to such thing felt somehow that the man carri a rich
atmospher with him a rich atmospher that suffoc it
remind one irrat of drowsi odour and of die lamp in
the darker poem of byron and poe with thi went a sens of hi
be clad not in lighter colour but in softer materials; hi
black seem richer and warmer than the black shade about him as
if it were compound of profound colour hi black coat look as
if it were onli black by be too dens a purpl hi black beard
look as if it were onli black by be too deep a blue and in
the gloom and thick of the beard hi dark red mouth show
sensual and scorn whatev he wa he wa not a frenchman; he
might be a jew; he might be someth deeper yet in the dark heart
of the east in the bright colour persian tile and pictur
show tyrant hunt you may see just those almond eye those
blue-black beard those cruel crimson lip

then came syme and next a veri old man professor de worm who
still kept the chair of friday though everi day it wa expect
that hi death would leav it empti save for hi intellect he wa
in the last dissolut of senil decay hi face wa as grey as
hi long grey beard hi forehead wa lift and fix final in a
furrow of mild despair in no other case not even that of gogol
did the bridegroom brillianc of the morn dress express a more
pain contrast for the red flower in hi button-hol show up
against a face that wa liter discolour like lead; the whole
hideou effect wa as if some drunken dandi had put their cloth
upon a corps when he rose or sat down which wa with long labour
and peril someth wors wa express than mere weak
someth indefin connect with the horror of the whole scene
it did not express decrepitud mere but corrupt anoth
hate fanci cross syme quiver mind he could not help
think that whenev the man move a leg or arm might fall off

right at the end sat the man call saturday the simplest and the
most baffl of all he wa a short squar man with a dark
squar face clean-shaven a medic practition go by the name
of bull he had that combin of savoir-fair with a sort of
well-groom coars which is not uncommon in young doctor he
carri hi fine cloth with confid rather than eas and he
mostli wore a set smile there wa noth whatev odd about him
except that he wore a pair of dark almost opaqu spectacl it
may have been mere a crescendo of nervou fanci that had gone
befor but those black disc were dread to syme; they remind
him of half-rememb ugli tale of some stori about penni
be put on the eye of the dead syme eye alway caught the
black glass and the blind grin had the die professor worn
them or even the pale secretari they would have been appropri
but on the younger and grosser man they seem onli an enigma they
took away the key of the face you could not tell what hi smile or
hi graviti meant partli from thi and partli becaus he had a
vulgar viril want in most of the other it seem to syme
that he might be the wickedest of all those wick men syme even
had the thought that hi eye might be cover up becaus they were
too fright to see



chapter vi

the exposur

such were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world again
and again syme strove to pull togeth hi common sens in their
presenc sometim he saw for an instant that these notion were
subject that he wa onli look at ordinari men one of whom
wa old anoth nervou anoth short-sight the sens of an
unnatur symbol alway settl back on him again each figur
seem to be somehow on the borderland of thing just as their
theori wa on the borderland of thought he knew that each one of
these men stood at the extrem end so to speak of some wild road
of reason he could onli fanci as in some old-world fabl
that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find
something--say a tree--that wa more or less than a tree a tree
possess by a spirit; and that if he went east to the end of the
world he would find someth els that wa not wholli itself--a
tower perhap of which the veri shape wa wick so these
figur seem to stand up violent and unaccount against an
ultim horizon vision from the verg the end of the earth
were close in

talk had been go on steadili as he took in the scene; and not
the least of the contrast of that bewild breakfast-t wa
the contrast between the easi and unobtrus tone of talk and it
terribl purport they were deep in the discuss of an actual and
immedi plot the waiter downstair had spoken quit correctli
when he said that they were talk about bomb and king onli
three day afterward the czar wa to meet the presid of the
french republ in pari and over their bacon and egg upon their
sunni balconi these beam gentlemen had decid how both should
die even the instrument wa chosen; the black-beard marqui it
appear wa to carri the bomb

ordinarili speak the proxim of thi posit and object
crime would have sober syme and cure him of all hi mere
mystic tremor he would have thought of noth but the need of
save at least two human bodi from be rip in piec with
iron and roar ga but the truth wa that by thi time he had
begun to feel a third kind of fear more pierc and practic
than either hi moral revuls or hi social respons veri
simpli he had no fear to spare for the french presid or the
czar; he had begun to fear for himself most of the talker took
littl heed of him debat now with their face closer togeth
and almost uniformli grave save when for an instant the smile of
the secretari ran aslant across hi face as the jag lightn
run aslant across the sky but there wa one persist thing
which first troubl syme and at last terrifi him the presid
wa alway look at him steadili and with a great and baffl
interest the enorm man wa quit quiet but hi blue eye
stood out of hi head and they were alway fix on syme

syme felt move to spring up and leap over the balconi when the
presid eye were on him he felt as if he were made of glass
he had hardli the shred of a doubt that in some silent and
extraordinari way sunday had found out that he wa a spi he
look over the edg of the balconi and saw a policeman stand
abstractedli just beneath stare at the bright rail and the
sunlit tree

then there fell upon him the great temptat that wa to torment
him for mani day in the presenc of these power and repuls
men who were the princ of anarchi he had almost forgotten the
frail and fanci figur of the poet gregori the mere aesthet of
anarch he even thought of him now with an old kind as if
they had play togeth when children but he rememb that he
wa still tie to gregori by a great promis he had promis never
to do the veri thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of
do he had promis not to jump over that balconi and speak to
that policeman he took hi cold hand off the cold stone
balustrad hi soul sway in a vertigo of moral indecis he
had onli to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villain
societi and all hi life could be as open and sunni as the squar
beneath him he had on the other hand onli to keep hi antiqu
honour and be deliv inch by inch into the power of thi great
enemi of mankind whose veri intellect wa a torture-chamb
whenev he look down into the squar he saw the comfort
policeman a pillar of common sens and common order whenev he
look back at the breakfast-t he saw the presid still
quietli studi him with big unbear eye

in all the torrent of hi thought there were two thought that
never cross hi mind first it never occur to him to doubt
that the presid and hi council could crush him if he continu
to stand alon the place might be public the project might seem
imposs but sunday wa not the man who would carri himself
thu easili without have somehow or somewher set open hi
iron trap either by anonym poison or sudden street accid
by hypnot or by fire from hell sunday could certainli strike
him if he defi the man he wa probabl dead either struck
stiff there in hi chair or long afterward as by an innoc
ailment if he call in the polic promptli arrest everyon
told all and set against them the whole energi of england he
would probabl escape; certainli not otherwis they were a
balcony of gentlemen overlook a bright and busi square; but
he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boat of
arm pirat overlook an empti sea

there wa a second thought that never came to him it never
occur to him to be spiritu won over to the enemi mani
modern inur to a weak worship of intellect and forc might
have waver in their allegi under thi oppress of a great
person they might have call sunday the super-man if ani
such creatur be conceiv he look inde somewhat like it
with hi earth-shak abstract as of a stone statu walk
he might have been call someth abov man with hi larg
plan which were too obviou to be detect with hi larg face
which wa too frank to be understood but thi wa a kind of
modern mean to which syme could not sink even in hi extrem
morbid like ani man he wa coward enough to fear great force;
but he wa not quit coward enough to admir it

the men were eat as they talk and even in thi they were
typic dr bull and the marqui ate casual and convent
of the best thing on the table--cold pheasant or strasbourg pie
but the secretari wa a vegetarian and he spoke earnestli of the
project murder over half a raw tomato and three quarter of a
glass of tepid water the old professor had such slop as suggest
a sicken second childhood and even in thi presid sunday
preserv hi curiou predomin of mere mass for he ate like
twenti men; he ate incred with a fright fresh of
appetit so that it wa like watch a sausag factori yet
continu when he had swallow a dozen crumpet or drunk a
quart of coffe he would be found with hi great head on one side
stare at syme

i have often wonder said the marqui take a great bite out
of a slice of bread and jam whether it wouldnt be better for me
to do it with a knife most of the best thing have been brought
off with a knife and it would be a new emot to get a knife into
a french presid and wriggl it round

you are wrong said the secretari draw hi black brow
togeth the knife wa mere the express of the old person
quarrel with a person tyrant dynamit is not onli our best tool
but our best symbol it is as perfect a symbol of us as is incens
of the prayer of the christian it expands; it onli destroy
becaus it broadens; even so thought onli destroy becaus it
broaden a man brain is a bomb he cri out loosen
suddenli hi strang passion and strike hi own skull with
violenc my brain feel like a bomb night and day it must
expand! it must expand! a man brain must expand if it break up
the univers

i dont want the univers broken up just yet drawl the
marqui i want to do a lot of beastli thing befor i die
i thought of one yesterday in bed

no if the onli end of the thing is noth said dr bull with
hi sphinx-lik smile it hardli seem worth do

the old professor wa stare at the ceil with dull eye

everi man know in hi heart he said that noth is worth
do

there wa a singular silenc and then the secretari said--

we are wander howev from the point the onli question is
how wednesday is to strike the blow i take it we should all agre
with the origin notion of a bomb as to the actual arrang
i should suggest that tomorrow morn he should go first of all
to--

the speech wa broken off short under a vast shadow presid
sunday had risen to hi feet seem to fill the sky abov them

befor we discuss that he said in a small quiet voic let us
go into a privat room i have someth vent particular to say

syme stood up befor ani of the other the instant of choic had
come at last the pistol wa at hi head on the pavement befor
he could hear the policeman idli stir and stamp for the morn
though bright wa cold

a barrel-organ in the street suddenli sprang with a jerk into a
jovial tune syme stood up taut as if it had been a bugl befor
the battl he found himself fill with a supernatur courag
that came from nowher that jingl music seem full of the
vivac the vulgar and the irrat valour of the poor who
in all those unclean street were all cling to the decenc and
the chariti of christendom hi youth prank of be a
policeman had fade from hi mind; he did not think of himself as
the repres of the corp of gentlemen turn into fanci
constabl or of the old eccentr who live in the dark room
but he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and
kindli peopl in the street who everi day march into battl to
the music of the barrel-organ and thi high pride in be human
had lift him unaccount to an infinit height abov the
monstrou men around him for an instant at least he look down
upon all their sprawl eccentr from the starri pinnacl
of the commonplac he felt toward them all that unconsci and
elementari superior that a brave man feel over power beast
or a wise man over power error he knew that he had neither the
intellectu nor the physic strength of presid sunday; but in
that moment he mind it no more than the fact that he had not the
muscl of a tiger or a horn on hi nose like a rhinocero all wa
swallow up in an ultim certainti that the presid wa wrong
and that the barrel-organ wa right there clang in hi mind that
unanswer and terribl truism in the song of roland--

pagen ont tort et chretien ont droit

which in the old nasal french ha the clang and groan of great
iron thi liber of hi spirit from the load of hi weak
went with a quit clear decis to embrac death if the peopl of
the barrel-organ could keep their old-world oblig so could
he thi veri pride in keep hi word wa that he wa keep it
to miscreant it wa hi last triumph over these lunat to go
down into their dark room and die for someth that they could not
even understand the barrel-organ seem to give the march tune
with the energi and the mingl nois of a whole orchestra; and he
could hear deep and roll under all the trumpet of the pride of
life the drum of the pride of death

the conspir were alreadi file through the open window and
into the room behind syme went last outwardli calm but with all
hi brain and bodi throb with romant rhythm the presid
led them down an irregular side stair such as might be use by
servant and into a dim cold empti room with a tabl and
bench like an abandon boardroom when they were all in he
close and lock the door

the first to speak wa gogol the irreconcil who seem
burst with inarticul grievanc

zso! zso! he cri with an obscur excit hi heavi polish
accent becom almost impenetr you zay you nod ide you zay
you show himselv it is all nuzzink ven you vant talk
import you run yourselv in a dark box!

the presid seem to take the foreign incoher satir with
entir good humour

you cant get hold of it yet gogol he said in a fatherli way
when onc they have heard us talk nonsens on that balconi they
will not care where we go afterward if we had come here first we
should have had the whole staff at the keyhol you dont seem to
know anyth about mankind

i die for zem cri the pole in thick excit and i slay
zare oppressor i care not for these game of gonzeal i would
zmite ze tyrant in ze open squar

i see i see said the presid nod kindli as he seat
himself at the top of a long tabl you die for mankind first and
then you get up and smite their oppressor so that all right
and now may i ask you to control your beauti sentiment and sit
down with the other gentlemen at thi tabl for the first time
thi morn someth intellig is go to be said

syme with the perturb promptitud he had shown sinc the
origin summon sat down first gogol sat down last grumbl
in hi brown beard about gombromis no one except syme seem to
have ani notion of the blow that wa about to fall as for him
he had mere the feel of a man mount the scaffold with the
intent at ani rate of make a good speech

comrad said the presid suddenli rise we have spun out
thi farc long enough i have call you down here to tell you
someth so simpl and shock that even the waiter upstair
(long inur to our levities) might hear some new serious in
my voic comrad we were discuss plan and name place i
propos befor say anyth els that those plan and place
should not be vote by thi meet but should be left wholli in
the control of some one reliabl member i suggest comrad
saturday dr bull

they all stare at him; then they all start in their seat for
the next word though not loud had a live and sensat
emphasi sunday struck the tabl

not one word more about the plan and place must be said at thi
meet not one tini detail more about what we mean to do must be
mention in thi compani

sunday had spent hi life in astonish hi followers; but it
seem as if he had never realli astonish them until now they
all move feverishli in their seat except syme he sat stiff in
hi with hi hand in hi pocket and on the handl of hi load
revolv when the attack on him came he would sell hi life dear
he would find out at least if the presid wa mortal

sunday went on smoothly--

you will probabl understand that there is onli one possibl
motiv for forbid free speech at thi festiv of freedom
stranger overhear us matter noth they assum that we
are joke but what would matter even unto death is thi
that there should be one actual among us who is not of us
who know our grave purpos but doe not share it who--

the secretari scream out suddenli like a woman

it cant be! he cri leap there cant--

the presid flap hi larg flat hand on the tabl like the
fin of some huge fish

ye he said slowli there is a spi in thi room there is a
traitor at thi tabl i will wast no more word hi name--

syme half rose from hi seat hi finger firm on the trigger

hi name is gogol said the presid he is that hairi humbug
over there who pretend to be a pole

gogol sprang to hi feet a pistol in each hand with the same
flash three men sprang at hi throat even the professor made
an effort to rise but syme saw littl of the scene for he wa
blind with a benefic darkness; he had sunk down into hi
seat shudder in a palsi of passion relief



chapter vii

the unaccount conduct of professor de worm

sit down! said sunday in a voic that he use onc or twice in
hi life a voic that made men drop drawn sword

the three who had risen fell away from gogol and that equivoc
person himself resum hi seat

well my man said the presid briskli address him as one
address a total stranger will you oblig me by put your
hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and show me what you have
there?

the alleg pole wa a littl pale under hi tangl of dark hair
but he put two finger into the pocket with appar cool and
pull out a blue strip of card when syme saw it lie on the
tabl he woke up again to the world outsid him for although
the card lay at the other extrem of the tabl and he could read
noth of the inscript on it it bore a startl resembl
to the blue card in hi own pocket the card which had been given
to him when he join the anti-anarchist constabulari

pathet slav said the presid tragic child of poland are
you prepar in the presenc of that card to deni that you are in
thi company--shal we say de trop?

right oh! said the late gogol it made everyon jump to hear a
clear commerci and somewhat cockney voic come out of that
forest of foreign hair it wa irrat as if a chinaman had
suddenli spoken with a scotch accent

i gather that you fulli understand your posit said sunday

you bet answer the pole i see it a fair cop all i say is
i dont believ ani pole could have imit my accent like i did
hi

i conced the point said sunday i believ your own accent to
be inimit though i shall practis it in my bath do you mind
leav your beard with your card?

not a bit answer gogol; and with one finger he rip off the
whole of hi shaggi head-cov emerg with thin red hair and
a pale pert face it wa hot he ad

i will do you the justic to say said sunday not without a sort
of brutal admir that you seem to have kept pretti cool under
it now listen to me i like you the consequ is that it would
annoy me for just about two and a half minut if i heard that you
had die in torment well if you ever tell the polic or ani
human soul about us i shall have that two and a half minut of
discomfort on your discomfort i will not dwell good day mind the
step

the red-hair detect who had masquerad as gogol rose to hi
feet without a word and walk out of the room with an air of
perfect nonchal yet the astonish syme wa abl to realis
that thi eas wa suddenli assumed; for there wa a slight stumbl
outsid the door which show that the depart detect had not
mind the step

time is fli said the presid in hi gayest manner after
glanc at hi watch which like everyth about him seem
bigger than it ought to be i must go off at once; i have to
take the chair at a humanitarian meet

the secretari turn to him with work eyebrow

would it not be better he said a littl sharpli to discuss
further the detail of our project now that the spi ha left us?

no i think not said the presid with a yawn like an
unobtrus earthquak leav it as it is let saturday settl
it i must be off breakfast here next sunday

but the late loud scene had whip up the almost nake nerv
of the secretari he wa one of those men who are conscienti
even in crime

i must protest presid that the thing is irregular he said
it is a fundament rule of our societi that all plan shall be
debat in full council of cours i fulli appreci your
forethought when in the actual presenc of a traitor--

secretari said the presid serious if youd take your head
home and boil it for a turnip it might be use i cant say but
it might

the secretari rear back in a kind of equin anger

i realli fail to understand-- he began in high offens

that it that it said the presid nod a great mani
time that where you fail right enough you fail to understand
whi you danc donkey he roar rise you didnt want to be
overheard by a spi didnt you? how do you know you arent
overheard now?

and with these word he shoulder hi way out of the room shake
with incomprehens scorn

four of the men left behind gape after him without ani appar
glimmer of hi mean syme alon had even a glimmer and
such as it wa it froze him to the bone if the last word of the
presid meant anyth they meant that he had not after all
pass unsuspect they meant that while sunday could not denounc
him like gogol he still could not trust him like the other

the other four got to their feet grumbl more or less and betook
themselv elsewher to find lunch for it wa alreadi well past
midday the professor went last veri slowli and pain syme
sat long after the rest had gone revolv hi strang posit
he had escap a thunderbolt but he wa still under a cloud at
last he rose and made hi way out of the hotel into leicest
squar the bright cold day had grown increasingli colder and
when he came out into the street he wa surpris by a few flake
of snow while he still carri the sword-stick and the rest of
gregori portabl luggag he had thrown the cloak down and left
it somewher perhap on the steam-tug perhap on the balconi
hope therefor that the snow-show might be slight he step
back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway
of a small and greasi hair-dress shop the front window of
which wa empti except for a sickli wax ladi in even dress

snow howev began to thicken and fall fast; and syme have
found one glanc at the wax ladi quit suffici to depress hi
spirit stare out instead into the white and empti street he wa
consider astonish to see stand quit still outsid the
shop and stare into the window a man hi top hat wa load
with snow like the hat of father christma the white drift wa
rise round hi boot and ankles; but it seem as if noth
could tear him away from the contempl of the colourless wax
doll in dirti even dress that ani human be should stand in
such weather look into such a shop wa a matter of suffici
wonder to syme; but hi idl wonder turn suddenli into a person
shock; for he realis that the man stand there wa the
paralyt old professor de worm it scarc seem the place for
a person of hi year and infirm

syme wa readi to believ anyth about the pervers of thi
dehuman brotherhood; but even he could not believ that the
professor had fallen in love with that particular wax ladi he
could onli suppos that the man maladi (whatev it was) involv
some momentari fit of rigid or tranc he wa not inclin
howev to feel in thi case ani veri compassion concern on
the contrari he rather congratul himself that the professor
stroke and hi elabor and limp walk would make it easi to
escap from him and leav him mile behind for syme thirst first
and last to get clear of the whole poison atmospher if onli
for an hour then he could collect hi thought formul hi
polici and decid final whether he should or should not keep
faith with gregori

he stroll away through the danc snow turn up two or three
street down through two or three other and enter a small soho
restaur for lunch he partook reflect of four small and
quaint cours drank half a bottl of red wine and end up over
black coffe and a black cigar still think he had taken hi
seat in the upper room of the restaur which wa full of the
chink of knive and the chatter of foreign he rememb that
in old day he had imagin that all these harmless and kindli
alien were anarchist he shudder rememb the real thing
but even the shudder had the delight shame of escap the wine
the common food the familiar place the face of natur and
talk men made him almost feel as if the council of the seven
day had been a bad dream; and although he knew it wa nevertheless
an object realiti it wa at least a distant one tall hous
and popul street lay between him and hi last sight of the
shame seven; he wa free in free london and drink wine among
the free with a somewhat easier action he took hi hat and stick
and stroll down the stair into the shop below

when he enter that lower room he stood stricken and root to the
spot at a small tabl close up to the blank window and the white
street of snow sat the old anarchist professor over a glass of
milk with hi lift livid face and pendent eyelid for an
instant syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon then with a
gestur as of blind hurri he brush past the professor dash
open the door and slam it behind him and stood outsid in the
snow

can that old corps be follow me? he ask himself bite hi
yellow moustach i stop too long up in that room so that even
such leaden feet could catch me up one comfort is with a littl
brisk walk i can put a man like that as far away as timbuctoo
or am i too fanciful? wa he realli follow me? sure sunday
would not be such a fool as to send a lame man?

he set off at a smart pace twist and whirl hi stick in
the direct of covent garden as he cross the great market the
snow increas grow blind and bewild as the afternoon
began to darken the snow-flak torment him like a swarm of
silver bee get into hi eye and beard they ad their
unremit futil to hi alreadi irrit nerves; and by the
time that he had come at a swing pace to the begin of fleet
street he lost patienc and find a sunday teashop turn
into it to take shelter he order anoth cup of black coffe
as an excus scarc had he done so when professor de worm
hobbl heavili into the shop sat down with difficulti and
order a glass of milk

syme walking-stick had fallen from hi hand with a great clang
which confess the conceal steel but the professor did not look
round syme who wa commonli a cool charact wa liter
gape as a rustic gape at a conjur trick he had seen no cab
following; he had heard no wheel outsid the shop; to all mortal
appear the man had come on foot but the old man could onli
walk like a snail and syme had walk like the wind he start up
and snatch hi stick half crazi with the contradict in mere
arithmet and swung out of the swing door leav hi coffe
untast an omnibu go to the bank went rattl by with an
unusu rapid he had a violent run of a hundr yard to reach
it; but he manag to spring sway upon the splash-board and
paus for an instant to pant he climb on to the top when he
had been seat for about half a minut he heard behind him a sort
of heavi and asthmat breath

turn sharpli he saw rise gradual higher and higher up
the omnibu step a top hat soil and drip with snow and
under the shadow of it brim the short-sight face and shaki
shoulder of professor de worm he let himself into a seat with
characterist care and wrap himself up to the chin in the
mackintosh rug

everi movement of the old man totter figur and vagu hand
everi uncertain gestur and panic-stricken paus seem to put
it beyond question that he wa helpless that he wa in the last
imbecil of the bodi he move by inch he let himself down
with littl gasp of caution and yet unless the philosoph
entiti call time and space have no vestig even of a practic
exist it appear quit unquestion that he had run after
the omnibu

syme sprang erect upon the rock car and after stare wildli
at the wintri sky that grew gloomier everi moment he ran down
the step he had repress an element impuls to leap over the
side

too bewild to look back or to reason he rush into one of
the littl court at the side of fleet street as a rabbit rush
into a hole he had a vagu idea if thi incomprehens old
jack-in-the-box wa realli pursu him that in that labyrinth of
littl street he could soon throw him off the scent he dive in
and out of those crook lane which were more like crack than
thoroughfares; and by the time that he had complet about twenti
altern angl and describ an unthink polygon he paus
to listen for ani sound of pursuit there wa none; there could
not in ani case have been much for the littl street were thick
with the soundless snow somewher behind red lion court howev
he notic a place where some energet citizen had clear away
the snow for a space of about twenti yard leav the wet
glisten cobble-ston he thought littl of thi as he pass
it onli plung into yet anoth arm of the maze but when a few
hundr yard farther on he stood still again to listen hi heart
stood still also for he heard from that space of rug stone
the clink crutch and labour feet of the infern crippl

the sky abov wa load with the cloud of snow leav london
in a dark and oppress prematur for that hour of the
even on each side of syme the wall of the alley were blind
and featureless; there wa no littl window or ani kind of eve he
felt a new impuls to break out of thi hive of hous and to get
onc more into the open and lamp-lit street yet he rambl and
dodg for a long time befor he struck the main thoroughfar
when he did so he struck it much farther up than he had fanci
he came out into what seem the vast and void of ludgat circu
and saw st paul cathedr sit in the sky

at first he wa startl to find these great road so empti as if
a pestil had swept through the citi then he told himself that
some degre of empti wa natural; first becaus the snow-storm
wa even danger deep and secondli becaus it wa sunday and
at the veri word sunday he bit hi lip; the word wa henceforth for
hire like some indec pun under the white fog of snow high up in
the heaven the whole atmospher of the citi wa turn to a veri
queer kind of green twilight as of men under the sea the seal
and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of st paul had in it
smoki and sinist colours--colour of sickli green dead red or
decay bronz that were just bright enough to emphasis the
solid white of the snow but right up against these dreari
colour rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the top of
the cathedr wa a random splash and great stain of snow still
cling as to an alpin peak it had fallen accident but just
so fallen as to half drape the dome from it veri topmost point
and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross when
syme saw it he suddenli straighten himself and made with hi
sword-stick an involuntari salut

he knew that that evil figur hi shadow wa creep quickli or
slowli behind him and he did not care

it seem a symbol of human faith and valour that while the sky
were darken that high place of the earth wa bright the
devil might have captur heaven but they had not yet captur
the cross he had a new impuls to tear out the secret of thi
danc jump and pursu paralytic; and at the entranc of
the court as it open upon the circu he turn stick in hand
to face hi pursuer

professor de worm came slowli round the corner of the irregular
alley behind him hi unnatur form outlin against a lone
gas-lamp irresist recal that veri imagin figur in
the nurseri rhyme the crook man who went a crook mile he
realli look as if he had been twist out of shape by the
tortuou street he had been thread he came nearer and nearer
the lamplight shine on hi lift spectacl hi lift
patient face syme wait for him as st georg wait for the
dragon as a man wait for a final explan or for death and
the old professor came right up to him and pass him like a total
stranger without even a blink of hi mourn eyelid

there wa someth in thi silent and unexpect innoc that
left syme in a final furi the man colourless face and manner
seem to assert that the whole follow had been an accid
syme wa galvanis with an energi that wa someth between
bitter and a burst of boyish deris he made a wild gestur
as if to knock the old man hat off call out someth like
catch me if you can and went race away across the white open
circu conceal wa imposs now; and look back over hi
shoulder he could see the black figur of the old gentleman come
after him with long swing stride like a man win a mile
race but the head upon that bound bodi wa still pale grave
and profession like the head of a lectur upon the bodi of a
harlequin

thi outrag chase sped across ludgat circu up ludgat hill
round st paul cathedr along cheapsid syme rememb all
the nightmar he had ever known then syme broke away toward the
river and end almost down by the dock he saw the yellow pane
of a low light public-hous flung himself into it and order
beer it wa a foul tavern sprinkl with foreign sailor a
place where opium might be smoke or knive drawn

a moment later professor de worm enter the place sat down
care and ask for a glass of milk



chapter viii

the professor explain

when gabriel syme found himself final establish in a chair
and opposit to him fix and final also the lift eyebrow and
leaden eyelid of the professor hi fear fulli return thi
incomprehens man from the fierc council after all had
certainli pursu him if the man had one charact as a paralyt
and anoth charact as a pursuer the antithesi might make him
more interest but scarc more sooth it would be a veri
small comfort that he could not find the professor out if by some
seriou accid the professor should find him out he empti a
whole pewter pot of ale befor the professor had touch hi milk

one possibl howev kept him hope and yet helpless it wa
just possibl that thi escapad signifi someth other than
even a slight suspicion of him perhap it wa some regular form or
sign perhap the foolish scamper wa some sort of friendli signal
that he ought to have understood perhap it wa a ritual perhap
the new thursday wa alway chase along cheapsid as the new lord
mayor is alway escort along it he wa just select a
tent inquiri when the old professor opposit suddenli and
simpli cut him short befor syme could ask the first diplomat
question the old anarchist had ask suddenli without ani sort of
preparation--

are you a policeman?

whatev els syme had expect he had never expect anyth so
brutal and actual as thi even hi great presenc of mind could
onli manag a repli with an air of rather blunder jocular

a policeman? he said laugh vagu whatev made you think
of a policeman in connect with me?

the process wa simpl enough answer the professor patient
i thought you look like a policeman i think so now

did i take a policeman hat by mistak out of the restaurant?
ask syme smile wildli have i by ani chanc got a number
stuck on to me somewhere? have my boot got that watch look?
whi must i be a policeman? do do let me be a postman

the old professor shook hi head with a graviti that gave no hope
but syme ran on with a feverish ironi

but perhap i misunderstood the delicaci of your german
philosophi perhap policeman is a rel term in an
evolutionari sens sir the ape fade so gradual into the
policeman that i myself can never detect the shade the monkey is
onli the policeman that may be perhap a maiden ladi on clapham
common is onli the policeman that might have been i dont mind
be the policeman that might have been i dont mind be
anyth in german thought

are you in the polic service? said the old man ignor all
syme improvis and desper railleri are you a detective?

syme heart turn to stone but hi face never chang

your suggest is ridicul he began whi on earth--

the old man struck hi palsi hand passion on the ricketi
tabl nearli break it

did you hear me ask a plain question you patter spy? he
shriek in a high crazi voic are you or are you not a
polic detective?

no! answer syme like a man stand on the hangman drop

you swear it said the old man lean across to him hi dead
face becom as it were loathsom aliv you swear it! you
swear it! if you swear fals will you be damned? will you be
sure that the devil danc at your funeral? will you see that the
nightmar sit on your grave? will there realli be no mistake? you
are an anarchist you are a dynamiter! abov all you are not in
ani sens a detective? you are not in the british police?

he leant hi angular elbow far across the tabl and put up hi
larg loos hand like a flap to hi ear

i am not in the british polic said syme with insan calm

professor de worm fell back in hi chair with a curiou air of
kindli collaps

that a piti he said becaus i am

syme sprang up straight send back the bench behind him with a
crash

becaus you are what? he said thickli you are what?

i am a policeman said the professor with hi first broad smile
and beam through hi spectacl but as you think policeman
onli a rel term of cours i have noth to do with you i
am in the british polic force; but as you tell me you are not in
the british polic forc i can onli say that i met you in a
dynamit club i suppos i ought to arrest you and with these
word he laid on the tabl befor syme an exact facsimil of the
blue card which syme had in hi own waistcoat pocket the symbol
of hi power from the polic

syme had for a flash the sensat that the cosmo had turn
exactli upsid down that all tree were grow downward and
that all star were under hi feet then came slowli the opposit
convict for the last twenty-four hour the cosmo had realli
been upsid down but now the capsiz univers had come right side
up again thi devil from whom he had been flee all day wa onli
an elder brother of hi own hous who on the other side of the
tabl lay back and laugh at him he did not for the moment ask
ani question of detail; he onli knew the happi and silli fact that
thi shadow which had pursu him with an intoler oppress
of peril wa onli the shadow of a friend tri to catch him up
he knew simultan that he wa a fool and a free man for with
ani recoveri from morbid there must go a certain healthi
humili there come a certain point in such condit when
onli three thing are possible: first a perpetu of satan
pride secondli tear and third laughter syme egot held hard
to the first cours for a few second and then suddenli adopt
the third take hi own blue polic ticket from hi own waist
coat pocket he toss it on to the table; then he flung hi head
back until hi spike of yellow beard almost point at the ceil
and shout with a barbar laughter

even in that close den perpetu fill with the din of knive
plate can clamor voic sudden struggl and stamped
there wa someth homer in syme mirth which made mani
half-drunken men look round

what yer laugh at guvnor? ask one wonder labour from
the dock

at myself answer syme and went off again into the agoni of
hi ecstat reaction

pull yourself togeth said the professor or youll get
hyster have some more beer ill join you

you havent drunk your milk said syme

my milk! said the other in tone of wither and unfathom
contempt my milk! do you think id look at the beastli stuff when
im out of sight of the bloodi anarchists? were all christian in
thi room though perhap he ad glanc around at the
reel crowd not strict one finish my milk? great blazes! ye
ill finish it right enough! and he knock the tumbler off the
tabl make a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid

syme wa stare at him with a happi curios

i understand now he cried; of cours your not an old man at
all

i cant take my face off here repli professor de worm it
rather an elabor make-up as to whether im an old man that
not for me to say i wa thirty-eight last birthday

ye but i mean said syme impati there noth the
matter with you

ye answer the other dispassion i am subject to cold

syme laughter at all thi had about it a wild weak of relief
he laugh at the idea of the paralyt professor be realli a
young actor dress up as if for the foot-light but he felt that
he would have laugh as loudli if a pepperpot had fallen over

the fals professor drank and wipe hi fals beard

did you know he ask that that man gogol wa one of us?

i? no i didnt know it answer syme in some surpris but
didnt you?

i knew no more than the dead repli the man who call himself
de worm i thought the presid wa talk about me and i
rattl in my boot

and i thought he wa talk about me said syme with hi rather
reckless laughter i had my hand on my revolv all the time

so had i said the professor grimly; so had gogol evid

syme struck the tabl with an exclam

whi there were three of us there! he cri three out of seven
is a fight number if we had onli known that we were three!

the face of professor de worm darken and he did not look up

we were three he said if we had been three hundr we could
still have done noth

not if we were three hundr against four? ask syme jeer
rather boister

no said the professor with sobrieti not if we were three
hundr against sunday

and the mere name struck syme cold and serious; hi laughter had
die in hi heart befor it could die on hi lip the face of
the unforgett presid sprang into hi mind as startl as
a colour photograph and he remark thi differ between
sunday and all hi satellit that their face howev fierc
or sinist becam gradual blur by memori like other human
face wherea sunday seem almost to grow more actual dure
absenc as if a man paint portrait should slowli come aliv

they were both silent for a measur of moment and then syme
speech came with a rush like the sudden foam of champagn

professor he cri it is intoler are you afraid of thi
man?

the professor lift hi heavi lid and gaze at syme with larg
wide-open blue eye of an almost ether honesti

ye i am he said mildli so are you

syme wa dumb for an instant then he rose to hi feet erect like
an insult man and thrust the chair away from him

ye he said in a voic indescrib you are right i am
afraid of him therefor i swear by god that i will seek out thi
man whom i fear until i find him and strike him on the mouth if
heaven were hi throne and the earth hi footstool i swear that
i would pull him down

how? ask the stare professor why?

becaus i am afraid of him said syme; and no man should leav
in the univers anyth of which he is afraid

de worm blink at him with a sort of blind wonder he made an
effort to speak but syme went on in a low voic but with an
undercurr of inhuman exaltation--

who would condescend to strike down the mere thing that he doe
not fear? who would debas himself to be mere brave like ani
common prizefighter? who would stoop to be fearless--lik a tree?
fight the thing that you fear you rememb the old tale of the
english clergyman who gave the last rite to the brigand of sicili
and how on hi death-b the great robber said i can give you no
money but i can give you advic for a lifetime: your thumb on the
blade and strike upward so i say to you strike upward if you
strike at the star

the other look at the ceil one of the trick of hi pose

sunday is a fix star he said

you shall see him a fall star said syme and put on hi hat

the decis of hi gestur drew the professor vagu to hi feet

have you ani idea he ask with a sort of benevol
bewilder exactli where you are going?

ye repli syme shortli i am go to prevent thi bomb be
thrown in pari

have you ani concept how? inquir the other

no said syme with equal decis

you rememb of cours resum the soi-dis de worm pull
hi beard and look out of the window that when we broke up
rather hurriedli the whole arrang for the atroc were left
in the privat hand of the marqui and dr bull the marqui is by
thi time probabl cross the channel but where he will go and
what he will do it is doubt whether even the presid knows;
certainli we dont know the onli man who doe know is dr bull

confound it! cri syme and we dont know where he is

ye said the other in hi curiou absent-mind way i know
where he is myself

will you tell me? ask syme with eager eye

i will take you there said the professor and took down hi own
hat from a peg

syme stood look at him with a sort of rigid excit

what do you mean? he ask sharpli will you join me? will you
take the risk?

young man said the professor pleasantli i am amus to observ
that you think i am a coward as to that i will say onli one word
and that shall be entir in the manner of your own philosoph
rhetor you think that it is possibl to pull down the presid
i know that it is imposs and i am go to tri it and
open the tavern door which let in a blast of bitter air they
went out togeth into the dark street by the dock

most of the snow wa melt or trampl to mud but here and there
a clot of it still show grey rather than white in the gloom the
small street were sloppi and full of pool which reflect the
flame lamp irregularli and by accid like fragment of some
other and fallen world syme felt almost daze as he step
through thi grow confus of light and shadows; but hi
companion walk on with a certain brisk toward where at
the end of the street an inch or two of the lamplit river look
like a bar of flame

where are you going? syme inquir

just now answer the professor i am go just round the
corner to see whether dr bull ha gone to bed he is hygien
and retir earli

dr bull! exclaim syme doe he live round the corner?

no answer hi friend as a matter of fact he live some way
off on the other side of the river but we can tell from here
whether he ha gone to bed

turn the corner as he spoke and face the dim river fleck
with flame he point with hi stick to the other bank on the
surrey side at thi point there ran out into the thame seem
almost to overhang it a bulk and cluster of those tall tenement
dot with light window and rise like factori chimney to
an almost insan height their special pois and posit made one
block of build especi look like a tower of babel with a
hundr eye syme had never seen ani of the sky-scrap build
in america so he could onli think of the build in a dream

even as he stare the highest light in thi innumer light
turret abruptli went out as if thi black argu had wink at him
with one of hi innumer eye

professor de worm swung round on hi heel and struck hi stick
against hi boot

we are too late he said the hygien doctor ha gone to bed

what do you mean? ask syme doe he live over there then?

ye said de worm behind that particular window which you
cant see come along and get some dinner we must call on him
tomorrow morn

without further parley he led the way through sever by-way
until they came out into the flare and clamour of the east india
dock road the professor who seem to know hi way about the
neighbourhood proceed to a place where the line of light
shop fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet in which
an old white inn all out of repair stood back some twenti feet
from the road

you can find good english inn left by accid everywher like
fossil explain the professor i onc found a decent place in
the west end

i suppos said syme smile that thi is the correspond
decent place in the east end?

it is said the professor rever and went in

in that place they dine and slept both veri thoroughli the
bean and bacon which these unaccount peopl cook well
the astonish emerg of burgundi from their cellar crown
syme sens of a new comradeship and comfort through all thi
ordeal hi root horror had been isol and there are no word
to express the abyss between isol and have one alli it may
be conced to the mathematician that four is twice two but two
is not twice one; two is two thousand time one that is whi in
spite of a hundr disadvantag the world will alway return to
monogami

syme wa abl to pour out for the first time the whole of hi
outrag tale from the time when gregori had taken him to
the littl tavern by the river he did it idli and ampli in a
luxuri monologu as a man speak with veri old friend on
hi side also the man who had imperson professor de worm
wa not less commun hi own stori wa almost as silli as
syme

that a good get-up of your said syme drain a glass of
macon; a lot better than old gogol even at the start i thought
he wa a bit too hairi

a differ of artist theori repli the professor pensiv
gogol wa an idealist he made up as the abstract or platon
ideal of an anarchist but i am a realist i am a portrait painter
but inde to say that i am a portrait painter is an inadequ
express i am a portrait

i dont understand you said syme

i am a portrait repeat the professor i am a portrait of the
celebr professor de worm who is i believ in napl

you mean you are made up like him said syme but doesnt he
know that you are take hi nose in vain?

he know it right enough repli hi friend cheer

then whi doesnt he denounc you?

i have denounc him answer the professor

do explain yourself said syme

with pleasur if you dont mind hear my stori repli the
emin foreign philosoph i am by profess an actor and my
name is wilk when i wa on the stage i mix with all sort of
bohemian and blackguard compani sometim i touch the edg of
the turf sometim the riff-raff of the art and occasion the
polit refuge in some den of exil dreamer i wa introduc
to the great german nihilist philosoph professor de worm i did
not gather much about him beyond hi appear which wa veri
disgust and which i studi care i understood that he had
prove that the destruct principl in the univers wa god;
henc he insist on the need for a furiou and incess energi
rend all thing in piec energi he said wa the all he wa
lame shortsight and partial paralyt when i met him i wa
in a frivol mood and i dislik him so much that i resolv to
imit him if i had been a draughtsman i would have drawn a
caricatur i wa onli an actor i could onli act a caricatur i
made myself up into what wa meant for a wild exagger of the
old professor dirti old self when i went into the room full of
hi support i expect to be receiv with a roar of laughter
or (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indign at the
insult i cannot describ the surpris i felt when my entranc wa
receiv with a respect silenc follow (when i had first
open my lips) with a murmur of admir the curs of the
perfect artist had fallen upon me i had been too subtl i had
been too true they thought i realli wa the great nihilist
professor i wa a healthy-mind young man at the time and i
confess that it wa a blow befor i could fulli recov howev
two or three of these admir ran up to me radiat indign
and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next
room i inquir it natur it seem that an impertin fellow
had dress himself up as a preposter parodi of myself i had
drunk more champagn than wa good for me and in a flash of folli
i decid to see the situat through consequ it wa to meet
the glare of the compani and my own lift eyebrow and freez
eye that the real professor came into the room

i need hardli say there wa a collis the pessimist all round
me look anxious from one professor to the other professor to
see which wa realli the more feebl but i won an old man in poor
health like my rival could not be expect to be so impress
feebl as a young actor in the prime of life you see he realli
had paralysi and work within thi definit limit he
couldnt be so jolli paralyt as i wa then he tri to blast my
claim intellectu i counter that by a veri simpl dodg
whenev he said someth that nobodi but he could understand i
repli with someth which i could not even understand myself
i dont fanci he said that you could have work out the
principl that evolut is onli negat sinc there inher in
it the introduct of lacuna which are an essenti of
differenti i repli quit scorn you read all that up
in pinckwerts; the notion that involut function eugen
wa expos long ago by glump it is unnecessari for me to say
that there never were such peopl as pinckwert and glump but the
peopl all round (rather to my surprise) seem to rememb them
quit well and the professor find that the learn and
mysteri method left him rather at the merci of an enemi slightli
defici in scrupl fell back upon a more popular form of wit
i see he sneer you prevail like the fals pig in aesop
and you fail i answer smile like the hedgehog in
montaign need i say that there is no hedgehog in montaigne?
your claptrap come off he said; so would your beard i had no
intellig answer to thi which wa quit true and rather witti
but i laugh heartili answer like the pantheist boot at
random and turn on my heel with all the honour of victori the
real professor wa thrown out but not with violenc though one
man tri veri patient to pull off hi nose he is now i
believ receiv everywher in europ as a delight impostor
hi appar earnest and anger you see make him all the more
entertain

well said syme i can understand your put on hi dirti old
beard for a night practic joke but i dont understand your
never take it off again

that is the rest of the stori said the imperson when i
myself left the compani follow by rever applaus i went
limp down the dark street hope that i should soon be far
enough away to be abl to walk like a human be to my
astonish as i wa turn the corner i felt a touch on the
shoulder and turn found myself under the shadow of an enorm
policeman he told me i wa want i struck a sort of paralyt
attitud and cri in a high german accent ye i am wanted--bi
the oppress of the world you are arrest me on the charg of
be the great anarchist professor de worm the policeman
impass consult a paper in hi hand no sir he said
civilli at least not exactli sir i am arrest you on the
charg of not be the celebr anarchist professor de worm
thi charg if it wa crimin at all wa certainli the lighter
of the two and i went along with the man doubt but not
greatli dismay i wa shown into a number of room and
eventu into the presenc of a polic offic who explain
that a seriou campaign had been open against the centr of
anarchi and that thi my success masquerad might be of
consider valu to the public safeti he offer me a good
salari and thi littl blue card though our convers wa
short he struck me as a man of veri massiv common sens and
humour; but i cannot tell you much about him person because--

syme laid down hi knife and fork

i know he said becaus you talk to him in a dark room

professor de worm nod and drain hi glass



chapter ix

the man in spectacl

burgundi is a jolli thing said the professor sadli as he set
hi glass down

you dont look as if it were said syme; you drink it as if it
were medicin

you must excus my manner said the professor dismal my
posit is rather a curiou one insid i am realli burst with
boyish merriment; but i act the paralyt professor so well that
now i cant leav off so that when i am among friend and have no
need at all to disguis myself i still cant help speak slow
and wrinkl my forehead--just as if it were my forehead i can be
quit happi you understand but onli in a paralyt sort of way
the most buoyant exclam leap up in my heart but they come
out of my mouth quit differ you should hear me say buck up
old cock! it would bring tear to your eye

it doe said syme; but i cannot help think that apart from
all that you are realli a bit worri

the professor start a littl and look at him steadili

you are a veri clever fellow he said it is a pleasur to work
with you ye i have rather a heavi cloud in my head there is a
great problem to face and he sank hi bald brow in hi two hand

then he said in a low voice--

can you play the piano?

ye said syme in simpl wonder im suppos to have a good
touch

then as the other did not speak he added--

i trust the great cloud is lift

after a long silenc the professor said out of the cavern
shadow of hi hands--

it would have done just as well if you could work a typewrit

thank you said syme you flatter me

listen to me said the other and rememb whom we have to see
tomorrow you and i are go tomorrow to attempt someth which
is veri much more danger than tri to steal the crown jewel
out of the tower we are tri to steal a secret from a veri
sharp veri strong and veri wick man i believ there is no man
except the presid of cours who is so serious startl and
formid as that littl grin fellow in goggl he ha not
perhap the white-hot enthusiasm unto death the mad martyrdom for
anarchi which mark the secretari but then that veri fanatic
in the secretari ha a human patho and is almost a redeem
trait but the littl doctor ha a brutal saniti that is more
shock than the secretari diseas dont you notic hi
detest viril and vital he bounc like an india-rubb
ball depend on it sunday wa not asleep (i wonder if he ever
sleeps?) when he lock up all the plan of thi outrag in the
round black head of dr bull

and you think said syme that thi uniqu monster will be
sooth if i play the piano to him?

dont be an ass said hi mentor i mention the piano becaus
it give one quick and independ finger syme if we are to go
through thi interview and come out sane or aliv we must have
some code of signal between us that thi brute will not see i
have made a rough alphabet cypher correspond to the five
fingers--lik thi see and he rippl with hi finger on the
wooden table--b a d bad a word we may frequent requir

syme pour himself out anoth glass of wine and began to studi
the scheme he wa abnorm quick with hi brain at puzzl
and with hi hand at conjur and it did not take him long to
learn how he might convey simpl messag by what would seem to
be idl tap upon a tabl or knee but wine and companionship had
alway the effect of inspir him to a farcic ingenu and
the professor soon found himself struggl with the too vast
energi of the new languag as it pass through the heat brain
of syme

we must have sever word-sign said syme seriously--word that
we are like to want fine shade of mean my favourit word is
coeval what yours?

do stop play the goat said the professor plaintiv you
dont know how seriou thi is

lush too said syme shake hi head sagaci we must
have lush--word appli to grass dont you know?

do you imagin ask the professor furious that we are go
to talk to dr bull about grass?

there are sever way in which the subject could be approach
said syme reflect and the word introduc without appear
forc we might say dr bull as a revolutionist you rememb
that a tyrant onc advis us to eat grass; and inde mani of us
look on the fresh lush grass of summer

do you understand said the other that thi is a tragedy?

perfectli repli syme; alway be comic in a tragedi what
the deuc els can you do? i wish thi languag of your had a
wider scope i suppos we could not extend it from the finger
to the toes? that would involv pull off our boot and sock
dure the convers which howev unobtrus performed--

syme said hi friend with a stern simplic go to bed!

syme howev sat up in bed for a consider time master the
new code he wa awaken next morn while the east wa still
seal with dark and found hi grey-beard alli stand like
a ghost besid hi bed

syme sat up in bed blinking; then slowli collect hi thought
threw off the bed-cloth and stood up it seem to him in some
curiou way that all the safeti and sociabl of the night befor
fell with the bedcloth off him and he stood up in an air of cold
danger he still felt an entir trust and loyalti toward hi
companion; but it wa the trust between two men go to the
scaffold

well said syme with a forc cheer as he pull on hi
trouser i dreamt of that alphabet of your did it take you
long to make it up?

the professor made no answer but gaze in front of him with eye
the colour of a wintri sea; so syme repeat hi question

i say did it take you long to invent all this? im consid
good at these thing and it wa a good hour grind did you
learn it all on the spot?

the professor wa silent; hi eye were wide open and he wore a
fix but veri small smile

how long did it take you?

the professor did not move

confound you cant you answer? call out syme in a sudden
anger that had someth like fear underneath whether or no the
professor could answer he did not

syme stood stare back at the stiff face like parchment and the
blank blue eye hi first thought wa that the professor had gone
mad but hi second thought wa more fright after all what did
he know about thi queer creatur whom he had heedlessli accept
as a friend? what did he know except that the man had been at the
anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridicul tale? how
improb it wa that there should be anoth friend there besid
gogol! wa thi man silenc a sensat way of declar war?
wa thi adamantin stare after all onli the aw sneer of some
threefold traitor who had turn for the last time? he stood and
strain hi ear in thi heartless silenc he almost fanci he
could hear dynamit come to captur him shift softli in the
corridor outsid

then hi eye stray downward and he burst out laugh though
the professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statu hi
five dumb finger were danc aliv upon the dead tabl syme
watch the twinkl movement of the talk hand and read
clearli the message--

i will onli talk like thi we must get use to it

he rap out the answer with the impati of relief--

all right let get out to breakfast

they took their hat and stick in silence; but as syme took hi
sword-stick he held it hard

they paus for a few minut onli to stuff down coffe and coars
thick sandwich at a coffe stall and then made their way across
the river which under the grey and grow light look as
desol as acheron they reach the bottom of the huge block of
build which they had seen from across the river and began in
silenc to mount the nake and numberless stone step onli paus
now and then to make short remark on the rail of the banist at
about everi other flight they pass a window; each window show
them a pale and tragic dawn lift itself labori over london
from each the innumer roof of slate look like the leaden
surg of a grey troubl sea after rain syme wa increasingli
consciou that hi new adventur had somehow a qualiti of cold
saniti wors than the wild adventur of the past last night for
instanc the tall tenement had seem to him like a tower in a
dream as he now went up the weari and perpetu step he wa
daunt and bewild by their almost infinit seri but it wa
not the hot horror of a dream or of anyth that might be
exagger or delus their infin wa more like the empti
infin of arithmet someth unthink yet necessari to
thought or it wa like the stun statement of astronomi about
the distanc of the fix star he wa ascend the hous of
reason a thing more hideou than unreason itself

by the time they reach dr bull land a last window show
them a harsh white dawn edg with bank of a kind of coars red
more like red clay than red cloud and when they enter dr bull
bare garret it wa full of light

syme had been haunt by a half histor memori in connect with
these empti room and that auster daybreak the moment he saw the
garret and dr bull sit write at a tabl he rememb what
the memori was--th french revolut there should have been the
black outlin of a guillotin against that heavi red and white of
the morn dr bull wa in hi white shirt and black breech
only; hi crop dark head might well have just come out of it
wig; he might have been marat or a more slipshod robespierr

yet when he wa seen properli the french fanci fell away the
jacobin were idealists; there wa about thi man a murder
materi hi dosit gave him a somewhat new appear the
strong white light of morn come from one side creat sharp
shadow made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had
look at the breakfast on the balconi thu the two black glass
that encas hi eye might realli have been black caviti in hi
skull make him look like a deaths-head and inde if ever
death himself sat write at a wooden tabl it might have been he

he look up and smile brightli enough as the men came in and
rose with the resili rapid of which the professor had
spoken he set chair for both of them and go to a peg behind
the door proceed to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough dark
tweed; he button it up neatli and came back to sit down at hi
tabl

the quiet good humour of hi manner left hi two oppon
helpless it wa with some momentari difficulti that the
professor broke silenc and began im sorri to disturb you so
earli comrad said he with a care resumpt of the slow
de worm manner you have no doubt made all the arrang for
the pari affair? then he ad with infinit slow we have
inform which render intoler anyth in the natur of a
moment delay

dr bull smile again but continu to gaze on them without
speak the professor resum a paus befor each weari word--

pleas do not think me excess abrupt; but i advis you to
alter those plan or if it is too late for that to follow your
agent with all the support you can get for him comrad syme and
i have had an experi which it would take more time to recount
than we can afford if we are to act on it i will howev
relat the occurr in detail even at the risk of lose time
if you realli feel that it is essenti to the understand of
the problem we have to discuss

he wa spin out hi sentenc make them intoler long
and linger in the hope of madden the practic littl
doctor into an explos of impati which might show hi hand
but the littl doctor continu onli to stare and smile and the
monologu wa uphil work syme began to feel a new sick and
despair the doctor smile and silenc were not at all like the
catalept stare and horribl silenc which he had confront in
the professor half an hour befor about the professor makeup
and all hi antic there wa alway someth mere grotesqu
like a gollywog syme rememb those wild woe of yesterday as
one rememb be afraid of bogi in childhood but here wa
daylight; here wa a healthi square-should man in tweed
not odd save for the accid of hi ugli spectacl not glare
or grin at all but smile steadili and not say a word
the whole had a sens of unbear realiti under the increas
sunlight the colour of the doctor complexion the pattern of
hi tweed grew and expand outrag as such thing grow
too import in a realist novel but hi smile wa quit
slight the pose of hi head polite; the onli uncanni thing wa
hi silenc

as i say resum the professor like a man toil through
heavi sand the incid that ha occur to us and ha led
us to ask for inform about the marqui is one which you
may think it better to have narrated; but as it came in the
way of comrad syme rather than me--

hi word he seem to be drag out like word in an anthem;
but syme who wa watch saw hi long finger rattl quickli
on the edg of the crazi tabl he read the messag you must
go on thi devil ha suck me dry!

syme plung into the breach with that bravado of improvis
which alway came to him when he wa alarm

ye the thing realli happen to me he said hastili i had
the good fortun to fall into convers with a detect who
took me thank to my hat for a respect person wish to
clinch my reput for respect i took him and made him
veri drunk at the savoy under thi influenc he becam friendli
and told me in so mani word that within a day or two they hope
to arrest the marqui in franc

so unless you or i can get on hi track--

the doctor wa still smile in the most friendli way and hi
protect eye were still impenetr the professor signal to
syme that he would resum hi explan and he began again with
the same elabor calm

syme immedi brought thi inform to me and we came here
togeth to see what use you would be inclin to make of it it
seem to me unquestion urgent that--

all thi time syme had been stare at the doctor almost as
steadili as the doctor stare at the professor but quit without
the smile the nerv of both comrades-in-arm were near snap
under that strain of motionless amiabl when syme suddenli
leant forward and idli tap the edg of the tabl hi messag
to hi alli ran i have an intuit

the professor with scarc a paus in hi monologu signal
back then sit on it

syme telegraph it is quit extraordinari

the other answer extraordinari rot!

syme said i am a poet

the other retort you are a dead man

syme had gone quit red up to hi yellow hair and hi eye were
burn feverishli as he said he had an intuit and it had
risen to a sort of lighthead certainti resum hi symbol
tap he signal to hi friend you scarc realis how poetic
my intuit is it ha that sudden qualiti we sometim feel in
the come of spring

he then studi the answer on hi friend finger the answer
wa go to hell!

the professor then resum hi mere verbal monologu address
to the doctor

perhap i should rather say said syme on hi finger that it
resembl that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the
heart of lush wood

hi companion disdain to repli

or yet again tap syme it is posit as is the passion
red hair of a beauti woman

the professor wa continu hi speech but in the middl of it
syme decid to act he leant across the tabl and said in a
voic that could not be neglected--

dr bull!

the doctor sleek and smile head did not move but they could
have sworn that under hi dark glass hi eye dart toward
syme

dr bull said syme in a voic peculiarli precis and
courteou would you do me a small favour? would you be so kind
as to take off your spectacles?

the professor swung round on hi seat and stare at syme with a
sort of frozen furi of astonish syme like a man who ha
thrown hi life and fortun on the tabl lean forward with a
fieri face the doctor did not move

for a few second there wa a silenc in which one could hear a
pin drop split onc by the singl hoot of a distant steamer on
the thame then dr bull rose slowli still smile and took
off hi spectacl

syme sprang to hi feet step backward a littl like a
chemic lectur from a success explos hi eye were like
star and for an instant he could onli point without speak

the professor had also start to hi feet forget of hi
suppos paralysi he leant on the back of the chair and stare
doubt at dr bull as if the doctor had been turn into a
toad befor hi eye and inde it wa almost as great a
transform scene

the two detect saw sit in the chair befor them a veri
boyish-look young man with veri frank and happi hazel eye an
open express cockney cloth like those of a citi clerk and
an unquestion breath about him of be veri good and rather
commonplac the smile wa still there but it might have been the
first smile of a babi

i knew i wa a poet cri syme in a sort of ecstasi i knew my
intuit wa as infal as the pope it wa the spectacl that
did it! it wa all the spectacl given those beastli black eye
and all the rest of him hi health and hi jolli look made him a
live devil among dead one

it certainli doe make a queer differ said the professor
shakili but as regard the project of dr bull--

project be damned! roar syme besid himself look at him!
look at hi face look at hi collar look at hi bless boots!
you dont suppos do you that that thing an anarchist?

syme! cri the other in an apprehens agoni

whi by god said syme ill take the risk of that myself! dr
bull i am a polic offic there my card and he flung down
the blue card upon the tabl

the professor still fear that all wa lost; but he wa loyal he
pull out hi own offici card and put it besid hi friend
then the third man burst out laugh and for the first time that
morn they heard hi voic

im aw glad you chap have come so earli he said with
a sort of schoolboy flippanc for we can all start for franc
togeth ye im in the forc right enough and he flick a
blue card toward them lightli as a matter of form

clap a brisk bowler on hi head and resum hi goblin
glass the doctor move so quickli toward the door that the
other instinct follow him syme seem a littl distrait
and as he pass under the doorway he suddenli struck hi stick
on the stone passag so that it rang

but lord god almighti he cri out if thi is all right there
were more damn detect than there were damn dynamit at
the damn council!

we might have fought easili said bull; we were four against
three

the professor wa descend the stair but hi voic came up from
below

no said the voic we were not four against three--w were not
so lucki we were four against one

the other went down the stair in silenc

the young man call bull with an innoc courtesi characterist
of him insist on go last until they reach the street; but
there hi own robust rapid assert itself unconsci and he
walk quickli on ahead toward a railway inquiri offic talk
to the other over hi shoulder

it is jolli to get some pal he said ive been half dead with
the jump be quit alon i nearli flung my arm round gogol
and embrac him which would have been imprud i hope you wont
despis me for have been in a blue funk

all the blue devil in blue hell said syme contribut to my
blue funk! but the worst devil wa you and your infern goggl

the young man laugh delightedli

wasnt it a rag? he said such a simpl idea--not my own i
havent got the brain you see i want to go into the detect
servic especi the anti-dynamit busi but for that
purpos they want someon to dress up as a dynamiter; and they
all swore by blaze that i could never look like a dynamit they
said my veri walk wa respect and that seen from behind i
look like the british constitut they said i look too
healthi and too optimist and too reliabl and benevolent; they
call me all sort of name at scotland yard they said that if i
had been a crimin i might have made my fortun by look so
like an honest man; but as i had the misfortun to be an honest
man there wa not even the remotest chanc of my assist them by
ever look like a crimin but as last i wa brought befor some
old josser who wa high up in the forc and who seem to have no
end of a head on hi shoulder and there the other all talk
hopelessli one ask whether a bushi beard would hide my nice
smile; anoth said that if they black my face i might look like
a negro anarchist; but thi old chap chip in with a most
extraordinari remark a pair of smoke spectacl will do it he
said posit look at him now; he look like an angel offic
boy put him on a pair of smoke spectacl and children will
scream at the sight of him and so it wa by george! when onc my
eye were cover all the rest smile and big shoulder and short
hair made me look a perfect littl devil as i say it wa simpl
enough when it wa done like miracles; but that wasnt the realli
miracul part of it there wa one realli stagger thing about
the busi and my head still turn at it

what wa that? ask syme

ill tell you answer the man in spectacl thi big pot in
the polic who size me up so that he knew how the goggl would
go with my hair and socks--bi god he never saw me at all!

syme eye suddenli flash on him

how wa that? he ask i thought you talk to him

so i did said bull brightly; but we talk in a pitch-dark
room like a coalcellar there you would never have guess that

i could not have conceiv it said syme grave

it is inde a new idea said the professor

their new alli wa in practic matter a whirlwind at the
inquiri offic he ask with businesslik breviti about the train
for dover have got hi inform he bundl the compani into
a cab and put them and himself insid a railway carriag befor
they had properli realis the breathless process they were
alreadi on the calai boat befor convers flow freeli

i had alreadi arrang he explain to go to franc for my
lunch; but i am delight to have someon to lunch with me you
see i had to send that beast the marqui over with hi bomb
becaus the presid had hi eye on me though god know how
ill tell you the stori some day it wa perfectli choke
whenev i tri to slip out of it i saw the presid somewher
smile out of the bow-window of a club or take off hi hat to
me from the top of an omnibu i tell you you can say what you
like that fellow sold himself to the devil; he can be in six
place at onc

so you sent the marqui off i understand ask the professor
wa it long ago? shall we be in time to catch him?

ye answer the new guid ive time it all hell still be
at calai when we arriv

but when we do catch him at calai said the professor what are
we go to do?

at thi question the counten of dr bull fell for the first
time he reflect a littl and then said--

theoret i suppos we ought to call the polic

not i said syme theoret i ought to drown myself first i
promis a poor fellow who wa a real modern pessimist on my word
of honour not to tell the polic im no hand at casuistri but i
cant break my word to a modern pessimist it like break one
word to a child

im in the same boat said the professor i tri to tell the
polic and i couldnt becaus of some silli oath i took you see
when i wa an actor i wa a sort of all-round beast perjuri or
treason is the onli crime i havent commit if i did that i
shouldnt know the differ between right and wrong

ive been through all that said dr bull and ive made up my
mind i gave my promis to the secretary--y know him man who
smile upsid down my friend that man is the most utterli
unhappi man that wa ever human it may be hi digest or hi
conscienc or hi nerv or hi philosophi of the univers but
he damn he in hell! well i cant turn on a man like that
and hunt him down it like whip a leper i may be mad but
that how i feel; and there jolli well the end of it

i dont think your mad said syme i knew you would decid
like that when first you--

eh? said dr bull

when first you took off your spectacl

dr bull smile a littl and stroll across the deck to look at
the sunlit sea then he stroll back again kick hi heel
carelessli and a companion silenc fell between the three men

well said syme it seem that we have all the same kind of
moral or immor so we had better face the fact that come
of it

ye assent the professor your quit right; and we must
hurri up for i can see the grey nose stand out from franc

the fact that come of it said syme serious is thi that we
three are alon on thi planet gogol ha gone god know where;
perhap the presid ha smash him like a fli on the council we
are three men against three like the roman who held the bridg
but we are wors off than that first becaus they can appeal to
their organ and we cannot appeal to our and second
because--

becaus one of those other three men said the professor is not
a man

syme nod and wa silent for a second or two then he said--

my idea is thi we must do someth to keep the marqui in
calai till tomorrow midday i have turn over twenti scheme in
my head we cannot denounc him as a dynamiter; that is agre we
cannot get him detain on some trivial charg for we should have
to appear; he know us and he would smell a rat we cannot pretend
to keep him on anarchist business; he might swallow much in that
way but not the notion of stop in calai while the czar went
safe through pari we might tri to kidnap him and lock him up
ourselves; but he is a well-known man here he ha a whole
bodyguard of friends; he is veri strong and brave and the event is
doubt the onli thing i can see to do is actual to take
advantag of the veri thing that are in the marquiss favour i am
go to profit by the fact that he is a highli respect nobleman
i am go to profit by the fact that he ha mani friend and move
in the best societi

what the devil are you talk about? ask the professor

the syme are first mention in the fourteenth centuri said
syme; but there is a tradit that one of them rode behind bruce
at bannockburn sinc 1350 the tree is quit clear

he gone off hi head said the littl doctor stare

our bear continu syme calmli are argent a chevron gule
charg with three cross crosslet of the field the motto
vari

the professor seiz syme roughli by the waistcoat

we are just inshor he said are you seasick or joke in the
wrong place?

my remark are almost pain practic answer syme in an
unhurri manner the hous of st eustach also is veri ancient
the marqui cannot deni that he is a gentleman he cannot deni
that i am a gentleman and in order to put the matter of my social
posit quit beyond a doubt i propos at the earliest
opportun to knock hi hat off but here we are in the harbour

they went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze syme
who had now taken the lead as bull had taken it in london led
them along a kind of marin parad until he came to some cafe
embow in a bulk of greeneri and overlook the sea as he
went befor them hi step wa slightli swagger and he swung
hi stick like a sword he wa make appar for the extrem
end of the line of cafe but he stop abruptli with a sharp
gestur he motion them to silenc but he point with one
glove finger to a cafe tabl under a bank of flower foliag
at which sat the marqui de st eustach hi teeth shine in
hi thick black beard and hi bold brown face shadow by a
light yellow straw hat and outlin against the violet sea



chapter x

the duel

syme sat down at a cafe tabl with hi companion hi blue eye
sparkl like the bright sea below and order a bottl of
saumur with a pleas impati he wa for some reason in a
condit of curiou hilar hi spirit were alreadi
unnatur high; they rose as the saumur sank and in half an
hour hi talk wa a torrent of nonsens he profess to be
make out a plan of the convers which wa go to ensu
between himself and the deadli marqui he jot it down wildli
with a pencil it wa arrang like a print catech with
question and answer and wa deliv with an extraordinari
rapid of utter

i shall approach befor take off hi hat i shall take off my
own i shall say the marqui de saint eustach i believ he
will say the celebr mr syme i presum he will say in the
most exquisit french how are you? i shall repli in the most
exquisit cockney oh just the syme--

oh shut it said the man in spectacl pull yourself
togeth and chuck away that bit of paper what are you realli
go to do?

but it wa a love catech said syme pathet do let
me read it you it ha onli forty-thre question and answer and
some of the marquiss answer are wonder witti i like to be
just to my enemi

but what the good of it all? ask dr bull in exasper

it lead up to my challeng dont you see said syme beam
when the marqui ha given the thirty-ninth repli which runs--

ha it by ani chanc occur to you ask the professor with
a ponder simplic that the marqui may not say all the
forty-thre thing you have put down for him? in that case i
understand your own epigram may appear somewhat more forc

syme struck the tabl with a radiant face

whi how true that is he said and i never thought of it sir
you have an intellect beyond the common you will make a name

oh your as drunk as an owl! said the doctor

it onli remain continu syme quit unperturb to adopt
some other method of break the ice (if i may so express it)
between myself and the man i wish to kill and sinc the cours of
a dialogu cannot be predict by one of it parti alon (a you
have point out with such recondit acumen) the onli thing to be
done i suppos is for the one parti as far as possibl to do
all the dialogu by himself and so i will by george! and he
stood up suddenli hi yellow hair blow in the slight sea
breez

a band wa play in a cafe chantant hidden somewher among the
tree and a woman had just stop sing on syme heat head
the bray of the brass band seem like the jar and jingl of that
barrel-organ in leicest squar to the tune of which he had onc
stood up to die he look across to the littl tabl where the
marqui sat the man had two companion now solemn frenchmen in
frock-coat and silk hat one of them with the red rosett of the
legion of honour evid peopl of a solid social posit
besid these black cylindr costum the marqui in hi
loos straw hat and light spring cloth look bohemian and even
barbaric; but he look the marqui inde one might say that he
look the king with hi anim eleg hi scorn eye and
hi proud head lift against the purpl sea but he wa no
christian king at ani rate; he wa rather some swarthi despot
half greek half asiat who in the day when slaveri seem
natur look down on the mediterranean on hi galley and hi
groan slave just so syme thought would the brown-gold face
of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green oliv and the
burn blue

are you go to address the meeting? ask the professor
peevishli see that syme still stood up without move

syme drain hi last glass of sparkl wine

i am he said point across to the marqui and hi companion
that meet that meet displeas me i am go to pull that
meet great ugli mahogany-colour nose

he step across swiftli if not quit steadili the marqui
see him arch hi black assyrian eyebrow in surpris but
smile polit

you are mr syme i think he said

syme bow

and you are the marqui de saint eustach he said grace
permit me to pull your nose

he leant over to do so but the marqui start backward
upset hi chair and the two men in top hat held syme back
by the shoulder

thi man ha insult me! said syme with gestur of
explan

insult you? cri the gentleman with the red rosett when?

oh just now said syme recklessli he insult my mother

insult your mother! exclaim the gentleman incredul

well anyhow said syme conced a point my aunt

but how can the marqui have insult your aunt just now? said
the second gentleman with some legitim wonder he ha been
sit here all the time

ah it wa what he said! said syme darkli

i said noth at all said the marqui except someth
about the band i onli said that i like wagner play well

it wa an allus to my famili said syme firmli my aunt
play wagner badli it wa a pain subject we are alway
be insult about it

thi seem most extraordinari said the gentleman who wa
decor look doubt at the marqui

oh i assur you said syme earnestli the whole of your
convers wa simpli pack with sinist allus to my
aunt weak

thi is nonsense! said the second gentleman i for one have
said noth for half an hour except that i like the sing of
that girl with black hair

well there you are again! said syme indignantli my aunt wa
red

it seem to me said the other that you are simpli seek a
pretext to insult the marqui

by george! said syme face round and look at him what a
clever chap you are!

the marqui start up with eye flame like a tiger

seek a quarrel with me! he cri seek a fight with me! by
god! there wa never a man who had to seek long these gentlemen
will perhap act for me there are still four hour of daylight
let us fight thi even

syme bow with a quit beauti gracious

marqui he said your action is worthi of your fame and blood
permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose
hand i shall place myself

in three long stride he rejoin hi companion and they who
had seen hi champagne-inspir attack and listen to hi idiot
explan were quit startl at the look of him for now that
he came back to them he wa quit sober a littl pale and he
spoke in a low voic of passion practic

i have done it he said hoars i have fix a fight on the
beast but look here and listen care there is no time for
talk you are my second and everyth must come from you now
you must insist and insist absolut on the duel come off
after seven tomorrow so as to give me the chanc of prevent him
from catch the 745 for pari if he miss that he miss hi
crime he cant refus to meet you on such a small point of time
and place but thi is what he will do he will choos a field
somewher near a waysid station where he can pick up the train
he is a veri good swordsman and he will trust to kill me in
time to catch it but i can fenc well too and i think i can keep
him in play at ani rate until the train is lost then perhap he
may kill me to consol hi feel you understand? veri well
then let me introduc you to some charm friend of mine and
lead them quickli across the parad he present them to the
marquiss second by two veri aristocrat name of which they had
not previous heard

syme wa subject to spasm of singular common sens not otherwis
a part of hi charact they were (a he said of hi impuls about
the spectacles) poetic intuit and they sometim rose to the
exalt of propheci

he had correctli calcul in thi case the polici of hi
oppon when the marqui wa inform by hi second that syme
could onli fight in the morn he must fulli have realis that
an obstacl had suddenli arisen between him and hi bomb-throw
busi in the capit natur he could not explain thi
object to hi friend so he chose the cours which syme had
predict he induc hi second to settl on a small meadow not
far from the railway and he trust to the fatal of the first
engag

when he came down veri coolli to the field of honour no one could
have guess that he had ani anxieti about a journey; hi hand
were in hi pocket hi straw hat on the back of hi head hi
handsom face brazen in the sun but it might have struck a
stranger as odd that there appear in hi train not onli hi
second carri the sword-cas but two of hi servant carri
a portmanteau and a luncheon basket

earli as wa the hour the sun soak everyth in warmth and
syme wa vagu surpris to see so mani spring flower burn
gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole compani stood
almost knee-deep

with the except of the marqui all the men were in sombr and
solemn morning-dress with hat like black chimney-pots; the littl
doctor especi with the addit of hi black spectacl
look like an undertak in a farc syme could not help feel a
comic contrast between thi funer church parad of apparel and
the rich and glisten meadow grow wild flower everywher
but inde thi comic contrast between the yellow blossom and
the black hat wa but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the
yellow blossom and the black busi on hi right wa a littl
wood; far away to hi left lay the long curv of the railway line
which he wa so to speak guard from the marqui whose goal
and escap it wa in front of him behind the black group of hi
oppon he could see like a tint cloud a small almond bush
in flower against the faint line of the sea

the member of the legion of honour whose name it seem wa
colonel ducroix approach the professor and dr bull with great
polit and suggest that the play should termin with the
first consider hurt

dr bull howev have been care coach by syme upon thi
point of polici insist with great digniti and in veri bad
french that it should continu until one of the combat wa
disabl syme had made up hi mind that he could avoid disabl
the marqui and prevent the marqui from disabl him for at
least twenti minut in twenti minut the pari train would have
gone by

to a man of the well-known skill and valour of monsieur de st
eustach said the professor solemnli it must be a matter of
indiffer which method is adopt and our princip ha strong
reason for demand the longer encount reason the delicaci
of which prevent me from be explicit but for the just and
honour natur of which i can--

peste! broke from the marqui behind whose face had suddenli
darken let us stop talk and begin and he slash off the
head of a tall flower with hi stick

syme understood hi rude impati and instinct look over
hi shoulder to see whether the train wa come in sight but
there wa no smoke on the horizon

colonel ducroix knelt down and unlock the case take out a
pair of twin sword which took the sunlight and turn to two
streak of white fire he offer one to the marqui who snatch
it without ceremoni and anoth to syme who took it bent it
and pois it with as much delay as wa consist with digniti

then the colonel took out anoth pair of blade and take one
himself and give anoth to dr bull proceed to place the
men

both combat had thrown off their coat and waistcoat and
stood sword in hand the second stood on each side of the line
of fight with drawn sword also but still sombr in their dark
frock-coat and hat the princip salut the colonel said
quietli engage! and the two blade touch and tingl

when the jar of the join iron ran up syme arm all the
fantast fear that have been the subject of thi stori fell
from him like dream from a man wake up in bed he rememb
them clearli and in order as mere delus of the nerves--how
the fear of the professor had been the fear of the tyrann
accid of nightmar and how the fear of the doctor had been
the fear of the airless vacuum of scienc the first wa the old
fear that ani miracl might happen the second the more hopeless
modern fear that no miracl can ever happen but he saw that
these fear were fanci for he found himself in the presenc of
the great fact of the fear of death with it coars and pitiless
common sens he felt like a man who had dream all night of
fall over precipic and had woke up on the morn when he
wa to be hang for as soon as he had seen the sunlight run
down the channel of hi foe foreshorten blade and as soon as
he had felt the two tongu of steel touch vibrat like two
live thing he knew that hi enemi wa a terribl fighter and
that probabl hi last hour had come

he felt a strang and vivid valu in all the earth around him in
the grass under hi feet; he felt the love of life in all live
thing he could almost fanci that he heard the grass growing; he
could almost fanci that even as he stood fresh flower were
spring up and break into blossom in the meadow--flow blood
red and burn gold and blue fulfil the whole pageant of the
spring and whenev hi eye stray for a flash from the calm
stare hypnot eye of the marqui they saw the littl tuft of
almond tree against the sky-lin he had the feel that if by
some miracl he escap he would be readi to sit for ever befor
that almond tree desir noth els in the world

but while earth and sky and everyth had the live beauti of a
thing lost the other half of hi head wa as clear as glass and
he wa parri hi enemi point with a kind of clockwork skill of
which he had hardli suppos himself capabl onc hi enemi
point ran along hi wrist leav a slight streak of blood but it
either wa not notic or wa tacitli ignor everi now and then
he ripost and onc or twice he could almost fanci that he felt
hi point go home but as there wa no blood on blade or shirt he
suppos he wa mistaken then came an interrupt and a chang

at the risk of lose all the marqui interrupt hi quiet
stare flash one glanc over hi shoulder at the line of railway
on hi right then he turn on syme a face transfigur to that of
a fiend and began to fight as if with twenti weapon the attack
came so fast and furiou that the one shine sword seem a
shower of shine arrow syme had no chanc to look at the
railway; but also he had no need he could guess the reason of the
marquiss sudden mad of battle--th pari train wa in sight

but the marquiss morbid energi over-reach itself twice syme
parri knock hi oppon point far out of the fight
circle; and the third time hi ripost wa so rapid that there
wa no doubt about the hit thi time syme sword actual bent
under the weight of the marquiss bodi which it had pierc

syme wa as certain that he had stuck hi blade into hi enemi as
a garden that he ha stuck hi spade into the ground yet the
marqui sprang back from the stroke without a stagger and syme
stood stare at hi own sword-point like an idiot there wa no
blood on it at all

there wa an instant of rigid silenc and then syme in hi turn
fell furious on the other fill with a flame curios the
marqui wa probabl in a gener sens a better fencer than he
as he had surmis at the begin but at the moment the marqui
seem distraught and at a disadvantag he fought wildli and even
weakli and he constantli look away at the railway line almost
as if he fear the train more than the point steel syme on the
other hand fought fierc but still care in an intellectu
furi eager to solv the riddl of hi own bloodless sword for
thi purpos he aim less at the marquiss bodi and more at hi
throat and head a minut and a half afterward he felt hi point
enter the man neck below the jaw it came out clean half mad he
thrust again and made what should have been a bloodi scar on the
marquiss cheek but there wa no scar

for one moment the heaven of syme again grew black with
supernatur terror sure the man had a charm life but thi
new spiritu dread wa a more aw thing than had been the mere
spiritu topsy-turvydom symbolis by the paralyt who pursu
him the professor wa onli a goblin; thi man wa a devil--perhap
he wa the devil! anyhow thi wa certain that three time had a
human sword been driven into him and made no mark when syme had
that thought he drew himself up and all that wa good in him sang
high up in the air as a high wind sing in the tree he thought of
all the human thing in hi story--of the chines lantern in
saffron park of the girl red hair in the garden of the honest
beer-swil sailor down by the dock of hi loyal companion
stand by perhap he had been chosen as a champion of all these
fresh and kindli thing to cross sword with the enemi of all
creation after all he said to himself i am more than a devil;
i am a man i can do the one thing which satan himself cannot do--i
can die and as the word went through hi head he heard a faint
and far-off hoot which would soon be the roar of the pari train

he fell to fight again with a supernatur leviti like a
mohammedan pant for paradis as the train came nearer and
nearer he fanci he could see peopl put up the floral
arch in paris; he join in the grow nois and the glori of
the great republ whose gate he wa guard against hell hi
thought rose higher and higher with the rise roar of the
train which end as if proudli in a long and pierc
whistl the train stop

suddenli to the astonish of everyon the marqui sprang back
quit out of sword reach and threw down hi sword the leap wa
wonder and not the less wonder becaus syme had plung hi
sword a moment befor into the man thigh

stop! said the marqui in a voic that compel a momentari
obedi i want to say someth

what is the matter? ask colonel ducroix stare ha there
been foul play?

there ha been foul play somewher said dr bull who wa a
littl pale our princip ha wound the marqui four time
at least and he is none the wors

the marqui put up hi hand with a curiou air of ghastli
patienc

pleas let me speak he said it is rather import mr
syme he continu turn to hi oppon we are fight
today if i rememb right becaus you express a wish (which
i thought irrational) to pull my nose would you oblig me by
pull my nose now as quickli as possible? i have to catch a
train

i protest that thi is most irregular said dr bull
indignantli

it is certainli somewhat oppos to preced said colonel
ducroix look wist at hi princip there is i think
one case on record (captain bellegard and the baron zumpt) in
which the weapon were chang in the middl of the encount at
the request of one of the combat but one can hardli call
one nose a weapon

will you or will you not pull my nose? said the marqui in
exasper come come mr syme! you want to do it do it!
you can have no concept of how import it is to me dont be
so selfish! pull my nose at onc when i ask you! and he bent
slightli forward with a fascin smile the pari train
pant and groan had grate into a littl station behind the
neighbour hill

syme had the feel he had more than onc had in these adventur
--the sens that a horribl and sublim wave lift to heaven wa
just toppl over walk in a world he half understood he took
two pace forward and seiz the roman nose of thi remark
nobleman he pull it hard and it came off in hi hand

he stood for some second with a foolish solemn with the
pasteboard probosci still between hi finger look at it
while the sun and the cloud and the wood hill look down
upon thi imbecil scene

the marqui broke the silenc in a loud and cheer voic

if anyon ha ani use for my left eyebrow he said he can have
it colonel ducroix do accept my left eyebrow! it the kind of
thing that might come in use ani day and he grave tore off
one of hi swarthi assyrian brow bring about half hi brown
forehead with it and polit offer it to the colonel who
stood crimson and speechless with rage

if i had known he splutter that i wa act for a poltroon
who pad himself to fight--

oh i know i know! said the marqui recklessli throw variou
part of himself right and left about the field you are make a
mistake; but it cant be explain just now i tell you the train
ha come into the station!

ye said dr bull fierc and the train shall go out of the
station it shall go out without you we know well enough for what
devil work--

the mysteri marqui lift hi hand with a desper gestur
he wa a strang scarecrow stand there in the sun with half hi
old face peel off and half anoth face glare and grin
from underneath

will you drive me mad? he cri the train--

you shall not go by the train said syme firmli and grasp hi
sword

the wild figur turn toward syme and seem to be gather
itself for a sublim effort befor speak

you great fat blast blear-ey blunder thunder
brainless godforsaken dodder damn fool! he said without
take breath you great silli pink-fac towhead turnip!
you--

you shall not go by thi train repeat syme

and whi the infern blaze roar the other should i want to
go by the train?

we know all said the professor sternli you are go to pari
to throw a bomb!

go to jericho to throw a jabberwock! cri the other tear
hi hair which came off easili

have you all got soften of the brain that you dont realis
what i am? did you realli think i want to catch that train?
twenti pari train might go by for me damn pari trains!

then what did you care about? began the professor

what did i care about? i didnt care about catch the train; i
care about whether the train caught me and now by god! it ha
caught me

i regret to inform you said syme with restraint that your
remark convey no impress to my mind perhap if you were to
remov the remain of your origin forehead and some portion of
what wa onc your chin your mean would becom clearer mental
lucid fulfil itself in mani way what do you mean by say
that the train ha caught you? it may be my literari fanci but
somehow i feel that it ought to mean someth

it mean everyth said the other and the end of everyth
sunday ha us now in the hollow of hi hand

us! repeat the professor as if stupefi what do you mean by
us?

the polic of course! said the marqui and tore off hi scalp
and half hi face

the head which emerg wa the blond well brush smooth-hair
head which is common in the english constabulari but the face wa
terribl pale

i am inspector ratcliff he said with a sort of hast that
verg on harsh my name is pretti well known to the polic
and i can see well enough that you belong to them but if there is
ani doubt about my posit i have a card and he began to pull a
blue card from hi pocket

the professor gave a tire gestur

oh dont show it us he said wearily; weve got enough of them
to equip a paper-chas

the littl man name bull had like mani men who seem to be of a
mere vivaci vulgar sudden movement of good tast here he
certainli save the situat in the midst of thi stagger
transform scene he step forward with all the graviti and
respons of a second and address the two second of the
marqui

gentlemen he said we all owe you a seriou apology; but i
assur you that you have not been made the victim of such a low
joke as you imagin or inde of anyth undignifi in a man of
honour you have not wast your time; you have help to save the
world we are not buffoon but veri desper men at war with a
vast conspiraci a secret societi of anarchist is hunt us like
hares; not such unfortun madmen as may here or there throw a
bomb through starvat or german philosophi but a rich and
power and fanat church a church of eastern pessim which
hold it holi to destroy mankind like vermin how hard they hunt us
you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguis
as those for which i apologis and to such prank as thi one by
which you suffer

the younger second of the marqui a short man with a black
moustach bow polit and said--

of cours i accept the apology; but you will in your turn forgiv
me if i declin to follow you further into your difficulti and
permit myself to say good morning! the sight of an acquaint and
distinguish fellow-townsman come to piec in the open air is
unusu and upon the whole suffici for one day colonel
ducroix i would in no way influenc your action but if you feel
with me that our present societi is a littl abnorm i am now
go to walk back to the town

colonel ducroix move mechan but then tug abruptli at hi
white moustach and broke out--

no by george! i wont if these gentlemen are realli in a mess
with a lot of low wrecker like that ill see them through it i
have fought for franc and it is hard if i cant fight for
civil

dr bull took off hi hat and wave it cheer as at a public
meet

dont make too much nois said inspector ratcliff sunday may
hear you

sunday! cri bull and drop hi hat

ye retort ratcliff he may be with them

with whom? ask syme

with the peopl out of that train said the other

what you say seem utterli wild began syme whi as a matter of
fact--but my god he cri out suddenli like a man who see an
explos a long way off by god! if thi is true the whole balli
lot of us on the anarchist council were against anarchy! everi born
man wa a detect except the presid and hi person
secretari what can it mean?

mean! said the new policeman with incred violenc it mean
that we are struck dead! dont you know sunday? dont you know that
hi joke are alway so big and simpl that one ha never thought
of them? can you think of anyth more like sunday than thi that
he should put all hi power enemi on the suprem council and
then take care that it wa not supreme? i tell you he ha bought
everi trust he ha captur everi cabl he ha control of everi
railway line--especi of that railway line! and he point a
shake finger toward the small waysid station the whole
movement wa control by him; half the world wa readi to rise
for him but there were just five peopl perhap who would have
resist him and the old devil put them on the suprem
council to wast their time in watch each other idiot that
we are he plan the whole of our idiocies! sunday knew that the
professor would chase syme through london and that syme would
fight me in franc and he wa combin great mass of capit
and seiz great line of telegraphi while we five idiot were
run after each other like a lot of confound babi play
blind man buff

well? ask syme with a sort of steadi

well repli the other with sudden seren he ha found us
play blind man buff today in a field of great rustic beauti
and extrem solitud he ha probabl captur the world; it onli
remain to him to captur thi field and all the fool in it and
sinc you realli want to know what wa my object to the arriv
of that train i will tell you my object wa that sunday or hi
secretari ha just thi moment got out of it

syme utter an involuntari cri and they all turn their eye
toward the far-off station it wa quit true that a consider
bulk of peopl seem to be move in their direct but they
were too distant to be distinguish in ani way

it wa a habit of the late marqui de st eustach said the new
policeman produc a leather case alway to carri a pair of
opera glass either the presid or the secretari is come
after us with that mob they have caught us in a nice quiet place
where we are under no temptat to break our oath by call
the polic dr bull i have a suspicion that you will see better
through these than through your own highli decor spectacl

he hand the field-glass to the doctor who immedi took
off hi spectacl and put the apparatu to hi eye

it cannot be as bad as you say said the professor somewhat
shaken there are a good number of them certainli but they may
easili be ordinari tourist

do ordinari tourist ask bull with the fieldglass to hi
eye wear black mask half-way down the face?

syme almost tore the glass out of hi hand and look through
them most men in the advanc mob realli look ordinari enough;
but it wa quit true that two or three of the leader in front
wore black half-mask almost down to their mouth thi disguis
is veri complet especi at such a distanc and syme found
it imposs to conclud anyth from the clean-shaven jaw and
chin of the men talk in the front but present as they
talk they all smile and one of them smile on one side



chapter xi

the crimin chase the polic

syme put the field-glass from hi eye with an almost ghastli
relief

the presid is not with them anyhow he said and wipe hi
forehead

but sure they are right away on the horizon said the
bewild colonel blink and but half recov from bull
hasti though polit explan could you possibl know your
presid among all those people?

could i know a white eleph among all those people! answer
syme somewhat irrit as you veri truli say they are on the
horizon; but if he were walk with them by god! i believ
thi ground would shake

after an instant paus the new man call ratcliff said with
gloomi decision--

of cours the presid isnt with them i wish to gemini he were
much more like the presid is ride in triumph through pari
or sit on the ruin of st paul cathedr

thi is absurd! said syme someth may have happen in our
absence; but he cannot have carri the world with a rush like
that it is quit true he ad frown dubious at the
distant field that lay toward the littl station it is
certainli true that there seem to be a crowd come thi way;
but they are not all the armi that you make out

oh they said the new detect contemptuously; no they are
not a veri valuabl forc but let me tell you frankli that they
are precis calcul to our value--w are not much my boy
in sunday univers he ha got hold of all the cabl and
telegraph himself but to kill the suprem council he regard as
a trivial matter like a post card; it may be left to hi privat
secretari and he spat on the grass

then he turn to the other and said somewhat austerely--

there is a great deal to be said for death; but if anyon ha
ani prefer for the other altern i strongli advis him
to walk after me

with these word he turn hi broad back and strode with silent
energi toward the wood the other gave one glanc over their
shoulder and saw that the dark cloud of men had detach itself
from the station and wa move with a mysteri disciplin
across the plain they saw alreadi even with the nake eye black
blot on the foremost face which mark the mask they wore
they turn and follow their leader who had alreadi struck the
wood and disappear among the twinkl tree

the sun on the grass wa dri and hot so in plung into the wood
they had a cool shock of shadow as of diver who plung into a
dim pool the insid of the wood wa full of shatter sunlight
and shaken shadow they made a sort of shudder veil almost
recal the dizzi of a cinematograph even the solid figur
walk with him syme could hardli see for the pattern of sun and
shade that danc upon them now a man head wa lit as with a
light of rembrandt leav all els obliterated; now again he had
strong and stare white hand with the face of a negro the
ex-marqui had pull the old straw hat over hi eye and the
black shade of the brim cut hi face so squar in two that it
seem to be wear one of the black half-mask of their pursuer
the fanci tint syme overwhelm sens of wonder wa he
wear a mask? wa anyon wear a mask? wa anyon anything?
thi wood of witcheri in which men face turn black and white
by turn in which their figur first swell into sunlight and
then fade into formless night thi mere chao of chiaroscuro
(after the clear daylight outside) seem to syme a perfect symbol
of the world in which he had been move for three day thi world
where men took off their beard and their spectacl and their
nose and turn into other peopl that tragic self-confid
which he had felt when he believ that the marqui wa a devil
had strang disappear now that he knew that the marqui wa
a friend he felt almost inclin to ask after all these
bewilder what wa a friend and what an enemi wa there
anyth that wa apart from what it seemed? the marqui had taken
off hi nose and turn out to be a detect might he not just
as well take off hi head and turn out to be a hobgoblin? wa not
everyth after all like thi bewild woodland thi danc
of dark and light? everyth onli a glimps the glimps alway
unforeseen and alway forgotten for gabriel syme had found in
the heart of that sun-splash wood what mani modern painter had
found there he had found the thing which the modern peopl call
impression which is anoth name for that final sceptic
which can find no floor to the univers

as a man in an evil dream strain himself to scream and wake syme
strove with a sudden effort to fling off thi last and worst of
hi fanci with two impati stride he overtook the man in the
marquiss straw hat the man whom he had come to address as
ratcliff in a voic exagg loud and cheer he broke
the bottomless silenc and made convers

may i ask he said where on earth we are all go to?

so genuin had been the doubt of hi soul that he wa quit glad
to hear hi companion speak in an easi human voic

we must get down through the town of lanci to the sea he said
i think that part of the countri is least like to be with
them

what can you mean by all this? cri syme they cant be
run the real world in that way sure not mani work men
are anarchist and sure if they were mere mob could not beat
modern armi and polic

mere mobs! repeat hi new friend with a snort of scorn so
you talk about mob and the work class as if they were the
question youv got that etern idiot idea that if anarchi
came it would come from the poor whi should it? the poor have
been rebel but they have never been anarchists; they have more
interest than anyon els in there be some decent govern
the poor man realli ha a stake in the countri the rich man
hasnt; he can go away to new guinea in a yacht the poor have
sometim object to be govern badly; the rich have alway
object to be govern at all aristocrat were alway
anarchist as you can see from the baron war

as a lectur on english histori for the littl one said syme
thi is all veri nice; but i have not yet grasp it applic

it applic is said hi inform that most of old sunday
right-hand men are south african and american millionair that is
whi he ha got hold of all the communications; and that is whi the
last four champion of the anti-anarchist polic forc are run
through a wood like rabbit

millionair i can understand said syme thought they are
nearli all mad but get hold of a few wick old gentlemen with
hobbi is one thing; get hold of great christian nation is
anoth i would bet the nose off my face (forgiv the allusion)
that sunday would stand perfectli helpless befor the task of
convert ani ordinari healthi person anywher

well said the other it rather depend what sort of person you
mean

well for instanc said syme he could never convert that
person and he point straight in front of him

they had come to an open space of sunlight which seem to express
to syme the final return of hi own good sense; and in the middl
of thi forest clear wa a figur that might well stand for that
common sens in an almost aw actual burnt by the sun and
stain with perspir and grave with the bottomless graviti of
small necessari toil a heavi french peasant wa cut wood with
a hatchet hi cart stood a few yard off alreadi half full of
timber; and the hors that crop the grass wa like hi master
valor but not desperate; like hi master he wa even
prosper but yet wa almost sad the man wa a norman taller
than the averag of the french and veri angular; and hi swarthi
figur stood dark against a squar of sunlight almost like some
allegor figur of labour fresco on a ground of gold

mr syme is say call out ratcliff to the french colonel
that thi man at least will never be an anarchist

mr syme is right enough there answer colonel ducroix
laugh if onli for the reason that he ha plenti of properti
to defend but i forgot that in your countri you are not use to
peasant be wealthi

he look poor said dr bull doubt

quit so said the colonel; that is whi he is rich

i have an idea call out dr bull suddenly; how much would he
take to give us a lift in hi cart? those dog are all on foot and
we could soon leav them behind

oh give him anything! said syme eagerli i have pile of money
on me

that will never do said the colonel; he will never have ani
respect for you unless you drive a bargain

oh if he haggles! began bull impati

eri haggl becaus he is a free man said the other you do
not understand; he would not see the mean of generos he is
not be tip

and even while they seem to hear the heavi feet of their strang
pursuer behind them they had to stand and stamp while the french
colonel talk to the french wood-cutt with all the leisur
badinag and bicker of market-day at the end of the four
minut howev they saw that the colonel wa right for the
wood-cutt enter into their plan not with the vagu servil
of a tout too-wel paid but with the serious of a solicitor
who had been paid the proper fee he told them that the best thing
they could do wa to make their way down to the littl inn on the
hill abov lanci where the innkeep an old soldier who had
becom devot in hi latter year would be certain to sympathis
with them and even to take risk in their support the whole
compani therefor pile themselv on top of the stack of wood
and went rock in the rude cart down the other and steeper side
of the woodland heavi and ramshackl as wa the vehicl it wa
driven quickli enough and they soon had the exhilar
impress of distanc altogeth those whoever they were who
were hunt them for after all the riddl as to where the
anarchist had got all these follow wa still unsolv one
man presenc had suffic for them; they had fled at the first
sight of the deform smile of the secretari syme everi now and
then look back over hi shoulder at the armi on their track

as the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distanc he
could see the sunlit slope beyond it and abov it; and across
these wa still move the squar black mob like one monstrou
beetl in the veri strong sunlight and with hi own veri strong
eye which were almost telescop syme could see thi mass of
men quit plainli he could see them as separ human figures;
but he wa increasingli surpris by the way in which they move
as one man they seem to be dress in dark cloth and plain
hat like ani common crowd out of the streets; but they did not
spread and sprawl and trail by variou line to the attack as
would be natur in an ordinari mob they move with a sort of
dread and wick wooden like a stare armi of automaton

syme point thi out to ratcliff

ye repli the policeman that disciplin that sunday he
is perhap five hundr mile off but the fear of him is on all of
them like the finger of god ye they are walk regularly; and
you bet your boot that they are talk regularli ye and
think regularli but the one import thing for us is that they
are disappear regularli

syme nod it wa true that the black patch of the pursu men
wa grow smaller and smaller as the peasant belabour hi
hors

the level of the sunlit landscap though flat as a whole fell
away on the farther side of the wood in billow of heavi slope
toward the sea in a way not unlik the lower slope of the
sussex down the onli differ wa that in sussex the road
would have been broken and angular like a littl brook but
here the white french road fell sheer in front of them like a
waterfal down thi direct descent the cart clatter at a
consider angl and in a few minut the road grow yet
steeper they saw below them the littl harbour of lanci and a
great blue arc of the sea the travel cloud of their enemi
had wholli disappear from the horizon

the hors and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elm and
the hors nose nearli struck the face of an old gentleman who
wa sit on the bench outsid the littl cafe of le soleil
dor the peasant grunt an apolog and got down from hi
seat the other also descend one by one and spoke to the old
gentleman with fragmentari phrase of courtesi for it wa quit
evid from hi expans manner that he wa the owner of the
littl tavern

he wa a white-hair apple-fac old boy with sleepi eye and
a grey moustache; stout sedentari and veri innoc of a type
that may often be found in franc but is still common in
cathol germani everyth about him hi pipe hi pot of beer
hi flower and hi beehiv suggest an ancestr peace; onli
when hi visitor look up as they enter the inn-parlour they
saw the sword upon the wall

the colonel who greet the innkeep as an old friend pass
rapidli into the inn-parlour and sat down order some ritual
refresh the militari decis of hi action interest syme
who sat next to him and he took the opportun when the old
innkeep had gone out of satisfi hi curios

may i ask you colonel he said in a low voic whi we have
come here?

colonel ducroix smile behind hi bristli white moustach

for two reason sir he said; and i will give first not the
most import but the most utilitarian we came here becaus
thi is the onli place within twenti mile in which we can get
hors

horses! repeat syme look up quickli

ye repli the other; if you peopl are realli to distanc
your enemi it is hors or noth for you unless of cours
you have bicycl and motor-car in your pocket

and where do you advis us to make for? ask syme doubt

beyond question repli the colonel you had better make all
hast to the polic station beyond the town my friend whom i
second under somewhat decept circumst seem to me to
exagger veri much the possibl of a gener rising; but
even he would hardli maintain i suppos that you were not safe
with the gendarm

syme nod gravely; then he said abruptly--

and your other reason for come here?

my other reason for come here said ducroix soberli is that
it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibl
near to death

syme look up at the wall and saw a crudely-paint and pathet
religi pictur then he said--

you are right and then almost immedi afterward ha
anyon seen about the horses?

ye answer ducroix you may be quit certain that i gave
order the moment i came in those enemi of your gave no
impress of hurri but they were realli move wonder fast
like a well-train armi i had no idea that the anarchist had so
much disciplin you have not a moment to wast

almost as he spoke the old innkeep with the blue eye and white
hair came ambl into the room and announc that six hors
were saddl outsid

by ducroix advic the five other equip themselv with some
portabl form of food and wine and keep their duell sword
as the onli weapon avail they clatter away down the steep
white road the two servant who had carri the marquiss
luggag when he wa a marqui were left behind to drink at the
cafe by common consent and not at all against their own
inclin

by thi time the afternoon sun wa slant westward and by it
ray syme could see the sturdi figur of the old innkeep grow
smaller and smaller but still stand and look after them
quit silent the sunshin in hi silver hair syme had a fix
superstiti fanci left in hi mind by the chanc phrase of the
colonel that thi wa inde perhap the last honest stranger
whom he should ever see upon the earth

he wa still look at thi dwindl figur which stood as a
mere grey blot touch with a white flame against the great green
wall of the steep down behind him and as he stare over the top
of the down behind the innkeep there appear an armi of
black-clad and march men they seem to hang abov the good
man and hi hous like a black cloud of locust the hors had
been saddl none too soon



chapter xii

the earth in anarchi

urg the hors to a gallop without respect to the rather
rug descent of the road the horsemen soon regain their
advantag over the men on the march and at last the bulk of the
first build of lanci cut off the sight of their pursuer
nevertheless the ride had been a long one and by the time they
reach the real town the west wa warm with the colour and
qualiti of sunset the colonel suggest that befor make
final for the polic station they should make the effort in
pass to attach to themselv one more individu who might be
use

four out of the five rich men in thi town he said are common
swindler i suppos the proport is pretti equal all over the
world the fifth is a friend of mine and a veri fine fellow; and
what is even more import from our point of view he own a
motor-car

i am afraid said the professor in hi mirth way look
back along the white road on which the black crawl patch might
appear at ani moment i am afraid we have hardli time for
afternoon call

doctor renard hous is onli three minut off said the
colonel

our danger said dr bull is not two minut off

ye said syme if we ride on fast we must leav them behind
for they are on foot

he ha a motor-car said the colonel

but we may not get it said bull

ye he is quit on your side

but he might be out

hold your tongu said syme suddenli what is that noise?

for a second they all sat as still as equestrian statu and
for a second--for two or three or four seconds--heaven and earth
seem equal still then all their ear in an agoni of
attent heard along the road that indescrib thrill and
throb that mean onli one thing--horses!

the colonel face had an instantan chang as if lightn
had struck it and yet left it scatheless

they have done us he said with brief militari ironi prepar
to receiv cavalry!

where can they have got the horses? ask syme as he
mechan urg hi steed to a canter

the colonel wa silent for a littl then he said in a strain
voice--

i wa speak with strict accuraci when i said that the soleil
dor wa the onli place where one can get hors within twenti
mile

no! said syme violent i dont believ hed do it not with
all that white hair

he may have been forc said the colonel gentli they must be
at least a hundr strong for which reason we are all go to
see my friend renard who ha a motor-car

with these word he swung hi hors suddenli round a street
corner and went down the street with such thunder speed that
the other though alreadi well at the gallop had difficulti in
follow the fli tail of hi hors

dr renard inhabit a high and comfort hous at the top of a
steep street so that when the rider alight at hi door they
could onc more see the solid green ridg of the hill with the
white road across it stand up abov all the roof of the town
they breath again to see that the road as yet wa clear and they
rang the bell

dr renard wa a beam brown-beard man a good exampl of that
silent but veri busi profession class which franc ha preserv
even more perfectli than england when the matter wa explain to
him he pooh-pooh the panic of the ex-marqui altogether; he said
with the solid french sceptic that there wa no conceiv
probabl of a gener anarchist rise anarchi he said
shrug hi shoulder it is childishness!

et ca cri out the colonel suddenli point over the other
shoulder and that is childish isnt it?

they all look round and saw a curv of black cavalri come
sweep over the top of the hill with all the energi of attila
swiftli as they rode howev the whole rank still kept well
togeth and they could see the black vizard of the first line
as level as a line of uniform but although the main black
squar wa the same though travel faster there wa now one
sensat differ which they could see clearli upon the slope
of the hill as if upon a slant map the bulk of the rider were
in one block; but one rider flew far ahead of the column and with
frantic movement of hand and heel urg hi hors faster and
faster so that one might have fanci that he wa not the pursuer
but the pursu but even at that great distanc they could see
someth so fanat so unquestion in hi figur that they
knew it wa the secretari himself i am sorri to cut short a
cultur discuss said the colonel but can you lend me your
motor-car now in two minutes?

i have a suspicion that you are all mad said dr renard smile
sociably; but god forbid that mad should in ani way interrupt
friendship let us go round to the garag

dr renard wa a mild man with monstrou wealth; hi room were
like the muse de cluni and he had three motor-car these
howev he seem to use veri sparingli have the simpl tast
of the french middl class and when hi impati friend came to
examin them it took them some time to assur themselv that one
of them even could be made to work thi with some difficulti they
brought round into the street befor the doctor hous when they
came out of the dim garag they were startl to find that
twilight had alreadi fallen with the abrupt of night in the
tropic either they had been longer in the place than they
imagin or some unusu canopi of cloud had gather over the
town they look down the steep street and seem to see a
slight mist come up from the sea

it is now or never said dr bull i hear hors

no correct the professor a hors

and as they listen it wa evid that the nois rapidli
come nearer on the rattl stone wa not the nois of the
whole cavalcad but that of the one horseman who had left it
far behind--th insan secretari

syme famili like most of those who end in the simpl life had
onc own a motor and he knew all about them he had leapt at
onc into the chauffeur seat and with flush face wa wrench
and tug at the disus machineri he bent hi strength upon one
handl and then said quit quietly--

i am afraid it no go

as he spoke there swept round the corner a man rigid on hi
rush hors with the rush and rigid of an arrow he had a
smile that thrust out hi chin as if it were disloc he swept
alongsid of the stationari car into which it compani had
crowd and laid hi hand on the front it wa the secretari
and hi mouth went quit straight in the solemn of triumph

syme wa lean hard upon the steer wheel and there wa no
sound but the rumbl of the other pursuer ride into the town
then there came quit suddenli a scream of scrape iron and the
car leapt forward it pluck the secretari clean out of hi
saddl as a knife is whip out of it sheath trail him
kick terribl for twenti yard and left him flung flat upon
the road far in front of hi frighten hors as the car took
the corner of the street with a splendid curv they could just
see the other anarchist fill the street and rais their
fallen leader

i cant understand whi it ha grown so dark said the professor
at last in a low voic

go to be a storm i think said dr bull i say it a piti
we havent got a light on thi car if onli to see by

we have said the colonel and from the floor of the car he
fish up a heavi old-fashion carv iron lantern with a light
insid it it wa obvious an antiqu and it would seem as if
it origin use had been in some way semi-religi for there
wa a rude mould of a cross upon one of it side

where on earth did you get that? ask the professor

i got it where i got the car answer the colonel chuckl
from my best friend while our friend here wa fight with the
steer wheel i ran up the front step of the hous and spoke to
renard who wa stand in hi own porch you will rememb i
suppos i said there no time to get a lamp he look up
blink amiabl at the beauti arch ceil of hi own front
hall from thi wa suspend by chain of exquisit ironwork
thi lantern one of the hundr treasur of hi treasur hous
by sheer forc he tore the lamp out of hi own ceil shatter
the paint panel and bring down two blue vase with hi
violenc then he hand me the iron lantern and i put it in the
car wa i not right when i said that dr renard wa worth
knowing?

you were said syme serious and hung the heavi lantern over
the front there wa a certain allegori of their whole posit
in the contrast between the modern automobil and it strang
ecclesiast lamp hitherto they had pass through the quietest
part of the town meet at most one or two pedestrian who could
give them no hint of the peac or the hostil of the place now
howev the window in the hous began one by one to be lit up
give a greater sens of habit and human dr bull turn
to the new detect who had led their flight and permit
himself one of hi natur and friendli smile

these light make one feel more cheer

inspector ratcliff drew hi brow togeth

there is onli one set of light that make me more cheer he
said and they are those light of the polic station which i can
see beyond the town pleas god we may be there in ten minut

then all bull boil good sens and optim broke suddenli out
of him

oh thi is all rave nonsense! he cri if you realli think
that ordinari peopl in ordinari hous are anarchist you must be
madder than an anarchist yourself if we turn and fought these
fellow the whole town would fight for us

no said the other with an immov simplic the whole town
would fight for them we shall see

while they were speak the professor had leant forward with
sudden excit

what is that noise? he said

oh the hors behind us i suppos said the colonel i thought
we had got clear of them

the hors behind us! no said the professor it is not hors
and it is not behind us

almost as he spoke across the end of the street befor them two
shine and rattl shape shot past they were gone almost in a
flash but everyon could see that they were motor-car and the
professor stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the
other two motor-car from dr renard garag

i tell you they were hi he repeat with wild eye and they
were full of men in masks!

absurd! said the colonel angrili dr renard would never give
them hi car

he may have been forc said ratcliff quietli the whole town
is on their side

you still believ that ask the colonel incredul

you will all believ it soon said the other with a hopeless
calm

there wa a puzzl paus for some littl time and then the
colonel began again abruptly--

no i cant believ it the thing is nonsens the plain peopl of
a peaceabl french town--

he wa cut short by a bang and a blaze of light which seem close
to hi eye as the car sped on it left a float patch of white
smoke behind it and syme had heard a shot shriek past hi ear

my god! said the colonel someon ha shot at us

it need not interrupt convers said the gloomi ratcliff
pray resum your remark colonel you were talk i think
about the plain peopl of a peaceabl french town

the stare colonel wa long past mind satir he roll hi
eye all round the street

it is extraordinari he said most extraordinari

a fastidi person said syme might even call it unpleas
howev i suppos those light out in the field beyond thi street
are the gendarmeri we shall soon get there

no said inspector ratcliff we shall never get there

he had been stand up and look keenli ahead of him now he sat
down and smooth hi sleek hair with a weari gestur

what do you mean? ask bull sharpli

i mean that we shall never get there said the pessimist
placidli they have two row of arm men across the road already;
i can see them from here the town is in arm as i said it wa

i can onli wallow in the exquisit comfort of my own exactitud

and ratcliff sat down comfort in the car and lit a cigarett
but the other rose excitedli and stare down the road syme had
slow down the car as their plan becam doubt and he brought
it final to a standstil just at the corner of a side street
that ran down veri steepli to the sea

the town wa mostli in shadow but the sun had not sunk; wherev
it level light could break through it paint everyth a
burn gold up thi side street the last sunset light shone as
sharp and narrow as the shaft of artifici light at the theatr
it struck the car of the five friend and lit it like a burn
chariot but the rest of the street especi the two end of
it wa in the deepest twilight and for some second they could
see noth then syme whose eye were the keenest broke into a
littl bitter whistl and said

it is quit true there is a crowd or an armi or some such thing
across the end of that street

well if there is said bull impati it must be someth
else--a sham fight or the mayor birthday or someth i cannot
and will not believ that plain jolli peopl in a place like thi
walk about with dynamit in their pocket get on a bit syme and
let us look at them

the car crawl about a hundr yard farther and then they were
all startl by dr bull break into a high crow of laughter

whi you silli mugs! he cri what did i tell you that
crowd as law-abid as a cow and if it werent it on our
side

how do you know? ask the professor stare

you blind bat cri bull dont you see who is lead them?

they peer again and then the colonel with a catch in hi
voic cri out--

whi it renard!

there wa inde a rank of dim figur run across the road
and they could not be clearli seen; but far enough in front to
catch the accid of the even light wa stalk up and down
the unmistak dr renard in a white hat stroke hi long
brown beard and hold a revolv in hi left hand

what a fool ive been! exclaim the colonel of cours the
dear old boy ha turn out to help us

dr bull wa bubbl over with laughter swing the sword in
hi hand as carelessli as a cane he jump out of the car and
ran across the interven space call out--

dr renard! dr renard!

an instant after syme thought hi own eye had gone mad in hi
head for the philanthrop dr renard had deliber rais hi
revolv and fire twice at bull so that the shot rang down the
road

almost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from
thi atroci explos a long puff of white cloud went up also
from the cigarett of the cynic ratcliff like all the rest he
turn a littl pale but he smile dr bull at whom the bullet
had been fire just miss hi scalp stood quit still in the
middl of the road without a sign of fear and then turn veri
slowli and crawl back to the car and climb in with two hole
through hi hat

well said the cigarett smoker slowli what do you think now?

i think said dr bull with precis that i am lie in bed
at no 217 peabodi build and that i shall soon wake up with a
jump; or if that not it i think that i am sit in a small
cushion cell in hanwel and that the doctor cant make much of
my case but if you want to know what i dont think ill tell you
i dont think what you think i dont think and i never shall
think that the mass of ordinari men are a pack of dirti modern
thinker no sir im a democrat and i still dont believ that
sunday could convert one averag navvi or counter-jump no i may
be mad but human isnt

syme turn hi bright blue eye on bull with an earnest which
he did not commonli make clear

you are a veri fine fellow he said you can believ in a saniti
which is not mere your saniti and your right enough about
human about peasant and peopl like that jolli old innkeep
but your not right about renard i suspect him from the first
he rationalist and what wors he rich when duti and
religion are realli destroy it will be by the rich

they are realli destroy now said the man with a cigarett and
rose with hi hand in hi pocket the devil are come on!

the men in the motor-car look anxious in the direct of hi
dreami gaze and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the
road wa advanc upon them dr renard march furious in
front hi beard fli in the breez

the colonel sprang out of the car with an intoler exclam

gentlemen he cri the thing is incred it must be a
practic joke if you knew renard as i do--it like call queen
victoria a dynamit if you had got the man charact into your
head--

dr bull said syme sardon ha at least got it into hi
hat

i tell you it cant be! cri the colonel stamp

renard shall explain it he shall explain it to me and he strode
forward

dont be in such a hurri drawl the smoker he will veri soon
explain it to all of us

but the impati colonel wa alreadi out of earshot advanc
toward the advanc enemi the excit dr renard lift hi
pistol again but perceiv hi oppon hesit and the
colonel came face to face with him with frantic gestur of
remonstr

it is no good said syme he will never get anyth out of that
old heathen i vote we drive bang through the thick of them bang
as the bullet went through bull hat we may all be kill but
we must kill a tidi number of them

i wont ave it said dr bull grow more vulgar in the
sincer of hi virtu the poor chap may be make a mistak
give the colonel a chanc

shall we go back then? ask the professor

no said ratcliff in a cold voic the street behind us is held
too in fact i seem to see there anoth friend of your syme

syme spun round smartli and stare backward at the track which
they had travel he saw an irregular bodi of horsemen gather
and gallop toward them in the gloom he saw abov the foremost
saddl the silver gleam of a sword and then as it grew nearer the
silver gleam of an old man hair the next moment with shatter
violenc he had swung the motor round and sent it dash down the
steep side street to the sea like a man that desir onli to die

what the devil is up? cri the professor seiz hi arm

the morn star ha fallen! said syme as hi own car went down
the dark like a fall star

the other did not understand hi word but when they look back
at the street abov they saw the hostil cavalri come round the
corner and down the slope after them; and foremost of all rode the
good innkeep flush with the fieri innoc of the even
light

the world is insane! said the professor and buri hi face in
hi hand

no said dr bull in adamantin humil it is i

what are we go to do? ask the professor

at thi moment said syme with a scientif detach i think
we are go to smash into a lamppost

the next instant the automobil had come with a catastroph jar
against an iron object the instant after that four men had crawl
out from under a chao of metal and a tall lean lamp-post that had
stood up straight on the edg of the marin parad stood out bent
and twist like the branch of a broken tree

well we smash someth said the professor with a faint
smile that some comfort

your becom an anarchist said syme dust hi cloth
with hi instinct of dainti

everyon is said ratcliff

as they spoke the white-hair horseman and hi follow came
thunder from abov and almost at the same moment a dark string
of men ran shout along the sea-front syme snatch a sword
and took it in hi teeth; he stuck two other under hi arm-pit
took a fourth in hi left hand and the lantern in hi right and
leapt off the high parad on to the beach below

the other leapt after him with a common accept of such
decis action leav the debri and the gather mob abov
them

we have one more chanc said syme take the steel out of hi
mouth whatev all thi pandemonium mean i suppos the polic
station will help us we cant get there for they hold the way
but there a pier or breakwat run out into the sea just here
which we could defend longer than anyth els like horatiu and
hi bridg we must defend it till the gendarmeri turn out keep
after me

they follow him as he went crunch down the beach and in a
second or two their boot broke not on the sea gravel but on
broad flat stone they march down a long low jetti run
out in one arm into the dim boil sea and when they came to
the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their
stori they turn and face the town

that town wa transfigur with uproar all along the high parad
from which they had just descend wa a dark and roar stream
of human with toss arm and fieri face grope and
glare toward them the long dark line wa dot with torch
and lanterns; but even where no flame lit up a furiou face they
could see in the farthest figur in the most shadowi gestur an
organis hate it wa clear that they were the accurs of all
men and they knew not whi

two or three men look littl and black like monkey leapt
over the edg as they had done and drop on to the beach these
came plough down the deep sand shout horribl and strove
to wade into the sea at random the exampl wa follow and the
whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edg like
black treacl

foremost among the men on the beach syme saw the peasant who had
driven their cart he splash into the surf on a huge
cart-hors and shook hi axe at them

the peasant! cri syme they have not risen sinc the middl
age

even if the polic do come now said the professor mourn
they can do noth with thi mob

nonsence! said bull desperately; there must be some peopl
left in the town who are human

no said the hopeless inspector the human be will soon be
extinct we are the last of mankind

it may be said the professor absent then he ad in hi
dreami voic what is all that at the end of the dunciad?

nor public flame; nor privat dare to shine;
nor human light is left nor glimps divine!
lo! thi dread empir chao is restored;
light die befor thine uncreat word:
thi hand great anarch let the curtain fall;
and univers dark buri all

stop! cri bull suddenli the gendarm are out

the low light of the polic station were inde blot and
broken with hurri figur and they heard through the dark
the clash and jingl of a disciplin cavalri

they are charg the mob! cri bull in ecstaci or alarm

no said syme they are form along the parad

they have unslung their carbin cri bull danc with
excit

ye said ratcliff and they are go to fire on us

as he spoke there came a long crackl of musketri and bullet
seem to hop like hailston on the stone in front of them

the gendarm have join them! cri the professor and struck
hi forehead

i am in the pad cell said bull solidli

there wa a long silenc and then ratcliff said look out
over the swollen sea all a sort of grey purple--

what doe it matter who is mad or who is sane? we shall all be
dead soon

syme turn to him and said--

you are quit hopeless then?

mr ratcliff kept a stoni silence; then at last he said quietly--

no; oddli enough i am not quit hopeless there is one insan
littl hope that i cannot get out of my mind the power of thi
whole planet is against us yet i cannot help wonder whether
thi one silli littl hope is hopeless yet

in what or whom is your hope? ask syme with curios

in a man i never saw said the other look at the leaden sea

i know what you mean said syme in a low voic the man in the
dark room but sunday must have kill him by now

perhap said the other steadily; but if so he wa the onli
man whom sunday found it hard to kill

i heard what you said said the professor with hi back turn
i also am hold hard on to the thing i never saw

all of a sudden syme who wa stand as if blind with
introspect thought swung round and cri out like a man
wake from sleep--

where is the colonel? i thought he wa with us!

the colonel! ye cri bull where on earth is the colonel?

he went to speak to renard said the professor

we cannot leav him among all those beast cri syme let us
die like gentlemen if--

do not piti the colonel said ratcliff with a pale sneer he
is extrem comfort he is--

no! no! no! cri syme in a kind of frenzi not the colonel too!
i will never believ it!

will you believ your eyes? ask the other and point to the
beach

mani of their pursuer had wade into the water shake their
fist but the sea wa rough and they could not reach the pier
two or three figur howev stood on the begin of the stone
footway and seem to be cautious advanc down it the glare
of a chanc lantern lit up the face of the two foremost one face
wore a black half-mask and under it the mouth wa twist about
in such a mad of nerv that the black tuft of beard wriggl
round and round like a restless live thing the other wa the
red face and white moustach of colonel ducroix they were in
earnest consult

ye he is gone too said the professor and sat down on a
stone everyth gone im gone! i cant trust my own bodili
machineri i feel as if my own hand might fli up and strike me

when my hand fli up said syme it will strike somebodi
els and he strode along the pier toward the colonel the
sword in one hand and the lantern in the other

as if to destroy the last hope or doubt the colonel who saw him
come point hi revolv at him and fire the shot miss
syme but struck hi sword break it short at the hilt syme
rush on and swung the iron lantern abov hi head

juda befor herod! he said and struck the colonel down upon
the stone then he turn to the secretari whose fright mouth
wa almost foam now and held the lamp high with so rigid and
arrest a gestur that the man wa as it were frozen for a
moment and forc to hear

do you see thi lantern? cri syme in a terribl voic do you
see the cross carv on it and the flame inside? you did not make
it you did not light it better men than you men who could
believ and obey twist the entrail of iron and preserv the
legend of fire there is not a street you walk on there is not a
thread you wear that wa not made as thi lantern wa by deni
your philosophi of dirt and rat you can make noth you can
onli destroy you will destroy mankind; you will destroy the world
let that suffic you yet thi one old christian lantern you shall
not destroy it shall go where your empir of ape will never have
the wit to find it

he struck the secretari onc with the lantern so that he staggered;
and then whirl it twice round hi head sent it fli far out
to sea where it flare like a roar rocket and fell

swords! shout syme turn hi flame face ; to the three
behind him let us charg these dog for our time ha come to
die

hi three companion came after him sword in hand syme sword
wa broken but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman
fling him down in a moment they would have flung themselv
upon the face of the mob and perish when an interrupt came
the secretari ever sinc syme speech had stood with hi hand
to hi stricken head as if dazed; now he suddenli pull off hi
black mask

the pale face thu peel in the lamplight reveal not so much
rage as astonish he put up hi hand with an anxiou author

there is some mistak he said mr syme i hardli think you
understand your posit i arrest you in the name of the law

up hi arm

chapter xiii

the pursuit of the presid

next morn five bewild but hilari peopl took the boat for
dover the poor old colonel might have had some caus to complain
have been first forc to fight for two faction that didnt
exist and then knock down with an iron lantern but he wa a
magnanim old gentleman and be much reliev that neither
parti had anyth to do with dynamit he saw them off on the pier
with great genial

the five reconcil detect had a hundr detail to explain to
each other the secretari had to tell syme how they had come to
wear mask origin in order to approach the suppos enemi as
fellow-conspirators;

syme had to explain how they had fled with such swift through
a civilis countri but abov all these matter of detail which
could be explain rose the central mountain of the matter that
they could not explain what did it all mean? if they were all
harmless offic what wa sunday? if he had not seiz the world
what on earth had he been up to? inspector ratcliff wa still
gloomi about thi

i cant make head or tail of old sunday littl game ani more

suppos we might find it out from him; but i confess that i should
feel a bit afraid of ask sunday who he realli is

whi ask the secretari for fear of bombs?

no said the professor for fear he might tell me

let us have some drink said dr bull after a silenc

throughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highli
convivi but they instinct kept togeth dr bull who had
alway been the optimist of the parti endeavour to persuad the
other four that the whole compani could take the same hansom cab
from victoria; but thi wa over-rul and they went in a
four-wheel with dr bull on the box sing they finish
their journey at an hotel in piccadilli circu so as to be close
to the earli breakfast next morn in leicest squar yet even
then the adventur of the day were not entir over dr bull
discont with the gener propos to go to bed had stroll
out of the hotel at about eleven to see and tast some of the
beauti of london twenti minut afterward howev he came
back and made quit a clamour in the hall syme who tri at
first to sooth him wa forc at last to listen to hi
commun with quit new attent

i tell you ive seen him! said dr bull with thick emphasi

next morn the battalion of the reunit six march stolidli
toward the hotel in leicest squar

thi is more cheer said dr bull; we are six men go to
ask one man what he mean

i think it is a bit queerer than that said syme i think it
is six men go to ask one man what they mean

they turn in silenc into the squar and though the hotel wa
in the opposit corner they saw at onc the littl balconi and a
figur that look too big for it he wa sit alon with bent
head pore over a newspap but all hi councillor who had
come to vote him down cross that squar as if they were watch
out of heaven by a hundr eye

they had disput much upon their polici about whether they
should leav the unmask gogol without and begin diplomat
or whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowd at
onc the influenc of syme and bull prevail for the latter
cours though the secretari to the last ask them whi they
attack sunday so rashli

my reason is quit simpl said syme i attack him rashli
becaus i am afraid of him

they follow syme up the dark stair in silenc and they all came
out simultan into the broad sunlight of the morn and the
broad sunlight of sunday smile

delightful! he said so pleas to see you all what an
exquisit day it is is the czar dead?

the secretari who happen to be foremost drew himself togeth
for a dignifi outburst

no sir he said sternli there ha been no massacr i bring you
news of no such disgust spectacl

inquir smile you mean dr bull spectacles?

the secretari choke for a moment and the presid went on with
a sort of smooth appeal--

of cours we all have our opinion and even our eye but realli
to call them disgust befor the man himself--

dr bull tore off hi spectacl and broke them on the tabl

my spectacl are blackguardli he said but im not look at
my face

i dare say it the sort of face that grow on one said the
presid in fact it grow on you; and who am i to quarrel

mysteri if you want to know what you are you are a set of
highli well-intent young jackass

and you said syme lean forward what are you?

incred height like some enorm wave about to arch abov

given them a good run for their money and i will now

befor one of them could move the monstrou man had swung himself
like some huge ourang-outang over the balustrad of the balconi
yet befor he drop he pull himself up again as on a horizont
bar and thrust hi great chin over the edg of the balconi
said solemnly--

there one thing ill tell you though about who i am i am the
man in the dark room who made you all policemen

with that he fell from the balconi bounc on the stone below
like a great ball of india-rubb and went bound off toward
the corner of the alhambra where he hail a hansom-cab and sprang
insid it the six detect had been stand thunderstruck and
livid in the light of hi last assertion; but when he disappear
into the cab syme practic sens return to him and leap

especi after what uncl said

the presid cabman seem to be regain some control over
hi hors and the pursuer gain a littl as they swept round
into the edgwar road and here there occur what seem to the

the fire-engin had struck still farther to the north into a
region that they did not recognise; and as it ran by a line of high
rail shadow with tree the six friend were startl but
somewhat reliev to see the presid leap from the fire-engin
though whether through anoth whim or the increas protest of

shone quit pale in the shadow

what place can thi be? he ask can it be the old devil
house? ive heard he ha a hous in north london

all the better said the secretari grimli plant a foot in
a foothold we shall find him at home

no but it isnt that said syme knit hi brow i hear
the most horribl nois like devil laugh and sneez and
blow their devilish noses!

hi dog bark of cours said the secretari

whi not say hi black-beetl barking! said syme furious
snail barking! geranium barking! did you ever hear a dog bark
like that?

he held up hi hand and there came out of the thicket a long
growl roar that seem to get under the skin and freez the
flesh--a low thrill roar that made a throb in the air
all about them

the dog of sunday would be no ordinari dog said gogol and
shudder

syme had jump down on the other side but he still stood
listen impati

well listen to that he said is that a dog--anybodi dog?

there broke upon their ear a hoars scream as of thing
protest and clamour in sudden pain; and then far off
like an echo what sound like a long nasal trumpet

well hi hous ought to be hell! said the secretary; and if
it is hell im go in! and he sprang over the tall rail
almost with one swing

the other follow they broke through a tangl of plant and
shrub and came out on an open path noth wa in sight but
dr bull suddenli struck hi hand togeth

whi you ass he cri it the zoo!

as they were look round wildli for ani trace of their wild
quarri a keeper in uniform came run along the path with a
man in plain cloth

ha it come thi way? gasp the keeper

ha what? ask syme

the elephant! cri the keeper an eleph ha gone mad and
run away!

he ha run away with an old gentleman said the other stranger
breathlessli a poor old gentleman with white hair!

what sort of old gentleman? ask syme with great curios

a veri larg and fat old gentleman in light grey cloth said
the keeper eagerli

well said syme if he that particular kind of old gentleman
if your quit sure that he a larg and fat old gentleman in
grey cloth you may take my word for it that the eleph ha
not run away with him he ha run away with the eleph the
eleph is not made by god that could run away with him if he
did not consent to the elop and by thunder there he is!

there wa no doubt about it thi time clean across the space of
grass about two hundr yard away with a crowd scream and
scamper vainli at hi heel went a huge grey eleph at an
aw stride with hi trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship
bowsprit and trumpet like the trumpet of doom on the back of
the bellow and plung anim sat presid sunday with all
the placid of a sultan but goad the anim to a furiou
speed with some sharp object in hi hand

stop him! scream the populac hell be out of the gate!

stop a landslide! said the keeper he is out of the gate!

and even as he spoke a final crash and roar of terror announc
that the great grey eleph had broken out of the gate of the
zoolog garden and wa careen down albani street like a
new and swift sort of omnibu

great lord! cri bull i never knew an eleph could go so
fast well it must be hansom-cab again if we are to keep him in
sight

as they race along to the gate out of which the eleph had
vanish syme felt a glare panorama of the strang anim in
the cage which they pass afterward he thought it queer that
he should have seen them so clearli he rememb especi
see pelican with their preposter pendant throat he
wonder whi the pelican wa the symbol of chariti except it wa
that it want a good deal of chariti to admir a pelican he
rememb a hornbil which wa simpli a huge yellow beak with a
small bird tie on behind it the whole gave him a sensat the
vivid of which he could not explain that natur wa alway
make quit mysteri joke sunday had told them that they
would understand him when they had understood the star he
wonder whether even the archangel understood the hornbil

the six unhappi detect flung themselv into cab and follow
the eleph share the terror which he spread through the long
stretch of the street thi time sunday did not turn round but
offer them the solid stretch of hi unconsci back which
madden them if possibl more than hi previou mockeri just
befor they came to baker street howev he wa seen to throw
someth far up into the air as a boy doe a ball mean to
catch it again but at their rate of race it fell far behind
just by the cab contain gogol; and in faint hope of a clue or
for some impuls unexplain he stop hi cab so as to pick it
up it wa address to himself and wa quit a bulki parcel on
examin howev it bulk wa found to consist of thirty-thre
piec of paper of no valu wrap one round the other when the
last cover wa torn away it reduc itself to a small slip of
paper on which wa written:--

the word i fanci should be pink

the man onc known as gogol said noth but the movement of hi
hand and feet were like those of a man urg a hors to renew
effort

through street after street through district after district went
the prodigi of the fli eleph call crowd to everi window
and drive the traffic left and right and still through all thi
insan public the three cab toil after it until they came to
be regard as part of a process and perhap the advertis
of a circu they went at such a rate that distanc were shorten
beyond belief and syme saw the albert hall in kensington when he
thought that he wa still in paddington the anim pace wa even
more fast and free through the empti aristocrat street of south
kensington and he final head toward that part of the sky-lin
where the enorm wheel of earl court stood up in the sky the
wheel grew larger and larger till it fill heaven like the wheel
of star

the beast outstrip the cab they lost him round sever
corner and when they came to one of the gate of the earl court
exhibit they found themselv final block in front of them
wa an enorm crowd; in the midst of it wa an enorm eleph
heav and shudder as such shapeless creatur do but the
presid had disappear

where ha he gone to? ask syme slip to the ground

gentleman rush into the exhibit sir! said an offici in a
daze manner then he ad in an injur voice: funni gentleman
sir ask me to hold hi hors and gave me thi

he held out with distast a piec of fold paper addressed: to
the secretari of the central anarchist council

the secretari rage rent it open and found written insid it:--

when the her run a mile
let the secretari smile;
when the her tri to fli
let the secretari die
rustic proverb

whi the etern crikey began the secretari did you let the
man in? do peopl commonli come to you exhibit ride on mad
elephants? do--

look! shout syme suddenli look over there!

look at what? ask the secretari savag

look at the captiv balloon! said syme and point in a frenzi

whi the blaze should i look at a captiv balloon? demand the
secretari what is there queer about a captiv balloon?

noth said syme except that it isnt captive!

they all turn their eye to where the balloon swung and swell
abov the exhibit on a string like a child balloon a second
afterward the string came in two just under the car and the
balloon broken loos float away with the freedom of a soap
bubbl

ten thousand devils! shriek the secretari he got into it!
and he shook hi fist at the sky

the balloon born by some chanc wind came right abov them and
they could see the great white head of the presid peer over
the side and look benevol down on them

god bless my soul! said the professor with the elderli manner
that he could never disconnect from hi bleach beard and
parchment face god bless my soul! i seem to fanci that
someth fell on the top of my hat!

he put up a trembl hand and took from that shelf a piec of
twist paper which he open absent onli to find it inscrib
with a true lover knot and the words:--

your beauti ha not left me indifferent--from littl snowdrop

there wa a short silenc and then syme said bite hi beard--

im not beaten yet the blast thing must come down somewher
let follow it!



chapter xiv

the six philosoph

across green field and break through bloom hedg toil
six draggl detect about five mile out of london the
optimist of the parti had at first propos that they should
follow the balloon across south england in hansom-cab but he
wa ultim convinc of the persist refus of the balloon
to follow the road and the still more persist refus of the
cabmen to follow the balloon consequ the tireless though
exasper travel broke through black thicket and plough
through plough field till each wa turn into a figur too
outrag to be mistaken for a tramp those green hill of
surrey saw the final collaps and tragedi of the admir light
grey suit in which syme had set out from saffron park hi silk
hat wa broken over hi nose by a swing bough hi coat-tail
were torn to the shoulder by arrest thorn the clay of
england wa splash up to hi collar; but he still carri hi
yellow beard forward with a silent and furiou determin and
hi eye were still fix on that float ball of ga which in
the full flush of sunset seem colour like a sunset cloud

after all he said it is veri beautiful!

it is singularli and strang beautiful! said the professor i
wish the beastli gas-bag would burst!

no said dr bull i hope it wont it might hurt the old boy

hurt him! said the vindict professor hurt him! not as much
as id hurt him if i could get up with him littl snowdrop!

i dont want him hurt somehow said dr bull

what! cri the secretari bitterli do you believ all that tale
about hi be our man in the dark room? sunday would say he wa
anybodi

i dont know whether i believ it or not said dr bull but it
isnt that that i mean i cant wish old sunday balloon to burst
because--

well said syme impati because?

well becaus he so jolli like a balloon himself said dr bull
desper i dont understand a word of all that idea of hi
be the same man who gave us all our blue card it seem to make
everyth nonsens but i dont care who know it i alway had a
sympathi for old sunday himself wick as he wa just as if he
wa a great bounc babi how can i explain what my queer sympathi
was? it didnt prevent my fight him like hell! shall i make it
clear if i say that i like him becaus he wa so fat?

you will not said the secretari

ive got it now cri bull it wa becaus he wa so fat and so
light just like a balloon we alway think of fat peopl as heavi
but he could have danc against a sylph i see now what i mean
moder strength is shown in violenc suprem strength is shown
in leviti it wa like the old speculations--what would happen if
an eleph could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?

our eleph said syme look upward ha leapt into the
sky like a grasshopp

and somehow conclud bull that whi i cant help like old
sunday no it not an admir of forc or ani silli thing
like that there is a kind of gaieti in the thing as if he were
burst with some good news havent you sometim felt it on a
spring day? you know natur play trick but somehow that day
prove they are good-natur trick i never read the bibl myself
but that part they laugh at is liter truth whi leap ye ye high
hills? the hill do leap--at least they tri to whi do i
like sunday? how can i tell you? becaus he such a
bounder

there wa a long silenc and then the secretari said in a curiou
strain voice--

you do not know sunday at all perhap it is becaus you are
better than i and do not know hell i wa a fierc fellow and a
trifl morbid from the first the man who sit in dark and
who chose us all chose me becaus i had all the crazi look of a
conspirator--becaus my smile went crook and my eye were
gloomi even when i smile but there must have been someth in
me that answer to the nerv in all these anarch men for when
i first saw sunday he express to me not your airi vital but
someth both gross and sad in the natur of thing i found him
smoke in a twilight room a room with brown blind down
infinit more depress than the genial dark in which our
master live he sat there on a bench a huge heap of a man dark
and out of shape he listen to all my word without speak or
even stir i pour out my most passion appeal and ask
my most eloqu question then after a long silenc the thing
began to shake and i thought it wa shaken by some secret maladi
it shook like a loathsom and live jelli it remind me of
everyth i had ever read about the base bodi that are the
origin of life--th deep sea lump and protoplasm it seem like
the final form of matter the most shapeless and the most shame
i could onli tell myself from it shudder that it wa
someth at least that such a monster could be miser and
then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain wa shake with
a lone laughter and the laughter wa at me do you ask me to
forgiv him that? it is no small thing to be laugh at by
someth at onc lower and stronger than oneself

sure you fellow are exagger wildli cut in the clear
voic of inspector ratcliff presid sunday is a terribl
fellow for one intellect but he is not such a barnum freak
physic as you make out he receiv me in an ordinari offic
in a grey check coat in broad daylight he talk to me in an
ordinari way but ill tell you what is a trifl creepi about
sunday hi room is neat hi cloth are neat everyth seem
in order; but he absent-mind sometim hi great bright eye
go quit blind for hour he forget that you are there now
absent-minded is just a bit too aw in a bad man we think
of a wick man as vigil we cant think of a wick man who is
honestli and sincer dreami becaus we darent think of a wick
man alon with himself an absentmind man mean a good-natur
man it mean a man who if he happen to see you will apologis
but how will you bear an absentmind man who if he happen to see
you will kill you? that is what tri the nerv abstract
combin with cruelti men have felt it sometim when they went
through wild forest and felt that the anim there were at onc
innoc and pitiless they might ignor or slay how would you
like to pass ten mortal hour in a parlour with an absent-mind
tiger?

and what do you think of sunday gogol? ask syme

i dont think of sunday on principl said gogol simpli ani
more than i stare at the sun at noonday

well that is a point of view said syme thought what do
you say professor?

the professor wa walk with bent head and trail stick and
he did not answer at all

wake up professor! said syme genial tell us what you think
of sunday

the professor spoke at last veri slowli

i think someth he said that i cannot say clearli or
rather i think someth that i cannot even think clearli but
it is someth like thi my earli life as you know wa a bit
too larg and loos

well when i saw sunday face i thought it wa too large--
everybodi doe but i also thought it wa too loos the face
wa so big that one couldnt focu it or make it a face at all
the eye wa so far away from the nose that it wasnt an eye
the mouth wa so much by itself that one had to think of it by
itself the whole thing is too hard to explain

he paus for a littl still trail hi stick and then went
on--

but put it thi way walk up a road at night i have seen a
lamp and a light window and a cloud make togeth a most complet
and unmistak face if anyon in heaven ha that face i shall
know him again yet when i walk a littl farther i found that
there wa no face that the window wa ten yard away the lamp ten
hundr yard the cloud beyond the world well sunday face
escap me; it ran away to right and left as such chanc pictur
run away and so hi face ha made me somehow doubt whether there
are ani face i dont know whether your face bull is a face or a
combin in perspect perhap one black disc of your beastli
glass is quit close and anoth fifti mile away oh the doubt
of a materialist are not worth a dump sunday ha taught me the
last and the worst doubt the doubt of a spiritualist i am a
buddhist i suppose; and buddhism is not a creed it is a doubt my
poor dear bull i do not believ that you realli have a face i
have not faith enough to believ in matter

syme eye were still fix upon the errant orb which redden
in the even light look like some rosier and more innoc
world

have you notic an odd thing he said about all your
descriptions? each man of you find sunday quit differ yet
each man of you can onli find one thing to compar him to--th
univers itself bull find him like the earth in spring gogol
like the sun at noonday the secretari is remind of the shapeless
protoplasm and the inspector of the careless of virgin
forest the professor say he is like a chang landscap thi
is queer but it is queerer still that i also have had my odd
notion about the presid and i also find that i think of sunday
as i think of the whole world

get on a littl faster syme said bull; never mind the
balloon

when i first saw sunday said syme slowli i onli saw hi back;
and when i saw hi back i knew he wa the worst man in the world
hi neck and shoulder were brutal like those of some apish god
hi head had a stoop that wa hardli human like the stoop of an
ox in fact i had at onc the revolt fanci that thi wa not
a man at all but a beast dress up in men cloth

get on said dr bull

and then the queer thing happen i had seen hi back from the
street as he sat in the balconi then i enter the hotel and
come round the other side of him saw hi face in the sunlight
hi face frighten me as it did everyone; but not becaus it wa
brutal not becaus it wa evil on the contrari it frighten me
becaus it wa so beauti becaus it wa so good

syme exclaim the secretari are you ill?

it wa like the face of some ancient archangel judg justli
after heroic war there wa laughter in the eye and in the mouth
honour and sorrow there wa the same white hair the same great
grey-clad shoulder that i had seen from behind but when i saw him
from behind i wa certain he wa an anim and when i saw him in
front i knew he wa a god

pan said the professor dreamili wa a god and an anim

then and again and alway went on syme like a man talk to
himself that ha been for me the mysteri of sunday and it is
also the mysteri of the world when i see the horribl back i am
sure the nobl face is but a mask when i see the face but for an
instant i know the back is onli a jest bad is so bad that we
cannot but think good an accident; good is so good that we feel
certain that evil could be explain but the whole came to a kind
of crest yesterday when i race sunday for the cab and wa just
behind him all the way

had you time for think then? ask ratcliff

time repli syme for one outrag thought i wa suddenli
possess with the idea that the blind blank back of hi head
realli wa hi face--an aw eyeless face stare at me! and i
fanci that the figur run in front of me wa realli a figur
run backward and danc as he ran

horrible! said dr bull and shudder

horribl is not the word said syme it wa exactli the worst
instant of my life and yet ten minut afterward when he put hi
head out of the cab and made a grimac like a gargoyl i knew that
he wa onli like a father play hide-and-seek with hi children

it is a long game said the secretari and frown at hi broken
boot

listen to me cri syme with extraordinari emphasi shall i
tell you the secret of the whole world? it is that we have onli
known the back of the world we see everyth from behind and it
look brutal that is not a tree but the back of a tree that is
not a cloud but the back of a cloud cannot you see that
everyth is stoop and hide a face? if we could onli get
round in front--

look! cri out bull clamor the balloon is come down!

there wa no need to cri out to syme who had never taken hi eye
off it he saw the great lumin globe suddenli stagger in the
sky right itself and then sink slowli behind the tree like a
set sun

the man call gogol who had hardli spoken through all their weari
travel suddenli threw up hi hand like a lost spirit

he is dead! he cri and now i know he wa my friend--mi friend
in the dark!

dead! snort the secretari you will not find him dead easili
if he ha been tip out of the car we shall find him roll as
a colt roll in a field kick hi leg for fun

clash hi hoof said the professor the colt do and so did
pan

pan again! said dr bull irrit you seem to think pan is
everyth

so he is said the professor in greek he mean everyth

dont forget said the secretari look down that he also
mean panic

syme had stood without hear ani of the exclam

it fell over there he said shortli let us follow it!

then he ad with an indescrib gesture--

oh if he ha cheat us all by get killed! it would be like
one of hi lark

he strode off toward the distant tree with a new energi hi rag
and ribbon flutter in the wind the other follow him in a
more footsor and dubiou manner and almost at the same moment all
six men realis that they were not alon in the littl field

across the squar of turf a tall man wa advanc toward them
lean on a strang long staff like a sceptr he wa clad in a
fine but old-fashion suit with knee-breeches; it colour wa
that shade between blue violet and grey which can be seen in
certain shadow of the woodland hi hair wa whitish grey and
at the first glanc taken along with hi knee-breech look
as if it wa powder hi advanc wa veri quiet; but for the
silver frost upon hi head he might have been one to the shadow
of the wood

gentlemen he said my master ha a carriag wait for you in
the road just by

who is your master? ask syme stand quit still

i wa told you knew hi name said the man respect

there wa a silenc and then the secretari said--

where is thi carriage?

it ha been wait onli a few moment said the stranger my
master ha onli just come home

syme look left and right upon the patch of green field in which
he found himself the hedg were ordinari hedg the tree seem
ordinari trees; yet he felt like a man entrap in fairyland

he look the mysteri ambassador up and down but he could
discov noth except that the man coat wa the exact colour of
the purpl shadow and that the man face wa the exact colour of
the red and brown and golden sky

show us the place syme said briefli and without a word the man
in the violet coat turn hi back and walk toward a gap in the
hedg which let in suddenli the light of a white road

as the six wander broke out upon thi thoroughfar they saw the
white road block by what look like a long row of carriag
such a row of carriag as might close the approach to some hous
in park lane along the side of these carriag stood a rank of
splendid servant all dress in the grey-blu uniform and all
have a certain qualiti of stateli and freedom which would not
commonli belong to the servant of a gentleman but rather to the
offici and ambassador of a great king there were no less than
six carriag wait one for each of the tatter and miser
band all the attend (a if in court-dress) wore sword and as
each man crawl into hi carriag they drew them and salut with
a sudden blaze of steel

what can it all mean? ask bull of syme as they separ is
thi anoth joke of sundays?

i dont know said syme as he sank wearili back in the cushion
of hi carriage; but if it is it one of the joke you talk
about it a good-natur one

the six adventur had pass through mani adventur but not one
had carri them so utterli off their feet as thi last adventur
of comfort they had all becom inur to thing go roughly; but
thing suddenli go smoothli swamp them they could not even
feebli imagin what the carriag were; it wa enough for them to
know that they were carriag and carriag with cushion they
could not conceiv who the old man wa who had led them; but it wa
quit enough that he had certainli led them to the carriag

syme drove through a drift dark of tree in utter
abandon it wa typic of him that while he had carri hi
beard chin forward fierc so long as anyth could be done
when the whole busi wa taken out of hi hand he fell back
on the cushion in a frank collaps

veri gradual and veri vagu he realis into what rich road
the carriag wa carri him he saw that they pass the stone
gate of what might have been a park that they began gradual to
climb a hill which while wood on both side wa somewhat more
orderli than a forest then there began to grow upon him as upon a
man slowli wake from a healthi sleep a pleasur in everyth
he felt that the hedg were what hedg should be live walls;
that a hedg is like a human armi disciplin but all the more
aliv he saw high elm behind the hedg and vagu thought how
happi boy would be climb there then hi carriag took a turn
of the path and he saw suddenli and quietli like a long low
sunset cloud a long low hous mellow in the mild light of
sunset all the six friend compar note afterward and
quarrelled; but they all agre that in some unaccount way the
place remind them of their boyhood it wa either thi elm-top
or that crook path it wa either thi scrap of orchard or that
shape of a window; but each man of them declar that he could
rememb thi place befor he could rememb hi mother

when the carriag eventu roll up to a larg low cavern
gateway anoth man in the same uniform but wear a silver star
on the grey breast of hi coat came out to meet them thi
impress person said to the bewild syme--

refresh are provid for you in your room

syme under the influenc of the same mesmer sleep of amaz
went up the larg oaken stair after the respect attend he
enter a splendid suit of apart that seem to be design
special for him he walk up to a long mirror with the ordinari
instinct of hi class to pull hi tie straight or to smooth hi
hair; and there he saw the fright figur that he was--blood
run down hi face from where the bough had struck him hi hair
stand out like yellow rag of rank grass hi cloth torn into
long waver tatter at onc the whole enigma sprang up simpli
as the question of how he had got there and how he wa to get out
again exactli at the same moment a man in blue who had been
appoint as hi valet said veri solemnly--

i have put out your cloth sir

clothes! said syme sardon i have no cloth except
these and he lift two long strip of hi frock-coat in
fascin festoon and made a movement as if to twirl like
a ballet girl

my master ask me to say said the attend that there is a
fanci dress ball tonight and that he desir you to put on the
costum that i have laid out meanwhil sir there is a bottl
of burgundi and some cold pheasant which he hope you will not
refus as it is some hour befor supper

cold pheasant is a good thing said syme reflect and
burgundi is a spank good thing but realli i do not want either
of them so much as i want to know what the devil all thi mean
and what sort of costum you have got laid out for me where is
it?

the servant lift off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blu
draperi rather of the natur of a domino on the front of which
wa emblazon a larg golden sun and which wa splash here
and there with flame star and crescent

your to be dress as thursday sir said the valet somewhat
affabl

dress as thursday! said syme in medit it doesnt sound
a warm costum

oh ye sir said the other eagerli the thursday costum is
quit warm sir it fasten up to the chin

well i dont understand anyth said syme sigh i have
been use so long to uncomfort adventur that comfort
adventur knock me out still i may be allow to ask whi i
should be particularli like thursday in a green frock spot
all over with the sun and moon those orb i think shine on
other day i onc saw the moon on tuesday i rememb

beg pardon sir said the valet bibl also provid for you
and with a respect and rigid finger he point out a passag
in the first chapter of genesi syme read it wonder it wa
that in which the fourth day of the week is associ with the
creation of the sun and moon here howev they reckon from
a christian sunday

thi is get wilder and wilder said syme as he sat down
in a chair who are these peopl who provid cold pheasant and
burgundi and green cloth and bibles? do they provid
everything?

ye sir everyth said the attend grave shall i help
you on with your costume?

oh hitch the balli thing on! said syme impati

but though he affect to despis the mummeri he felt a curiou
freedom and natur in hi movement as the blue and gold
garment fell about him; and when he found that he had to wear a
sword it stir a boyish dream as he pass out of the room he
flung the fold across hi shoulder with a gestur hi sword
stood out at an angl and he had all the swagger of a troubadour
for these disguis did not disguis but reveal



chapter xv

the accus

as syme strode along the corridor he saw the secretari stand at
the top of a great flight of stair the man had never look so
nobl he wa drape in a long robe of starless black down the
centr of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white like a
singl shaft of light the whole look like some veri sever
ecclesiast vestment there wa no need for syme to search hi
memori or the bibl in order to rememb that the first day of
creation mark the mere creation of light out of dark the
vestment itself would alon have suggest the symbol; and syme
felt also how perfectli thi pattern of pure white and black
express the soul of the pale and auster secretari with hi
inhuman verac and hi cold frenzi which made him so easili
make war on the anarchist and yet so easili pass for one of
them syme wa scarc surpris to notic that amid all the
eas and hospit of their new surround thi man eye
were still stern no smell of ale or orchard could make the
secretari ceas to ask a reason question

if syme had been abl to see himself he would have realis that
he too seem to be for the first time himself and no one els
for if the secretari stood for that philosoph who love the
origin and formless light syme wa a type of the poet who seek
alway to make the light in special shape to split it up into
sun and star the philosoph may sometim love the infinite; the
poet alway love the finit for him the great moment is not the
creation of light but the creation of the sun and moon

as they descend the broad stair togeth they overtook
ratcliff who wa clad in spring green like a huntsman and the
pattern upon whose garment wa a green tangl of tree for he
stood for that third day on which the earth and green thing were
made and hi squar sensibl face with it not unfriendli
cynic seem appropri enough to it

they were led out of anoth broad and low gateway into a veri
larg old english garden full of torch and bonfir by the
broken light of which a vast carniv of peopl were danc in
motley dress syme seem to see everi shape in natur imit
in some crazi costum there wa a man dress as a windmil with
enorm sail a man dress as an eleph a man dress as a
balloon; the two last togeth seem to keep the thread of
their farcic adventur syme even saw with a queer thrill
one dancer dress like an enorm hornbil with a beak twice
as big as himself--th queer bird which had fix itself on hi
fanci like a live question while he wa rush down the long
road at the zoolog garden there were a thousand other such
object howev there wa a danc lamp-post a danc appl
tree a danc ship one would have thought that the untam
tune of some mad musician had set all the common object of field
and street danc an etern jig and long afterward when syme
wa middle-ag and at rest he could never see one of those
particular objects--a lamppost or an appl tree or a windmill--
without think that it wa a stray revel from that revel
of masquerad

on one side of thi lawn aliv with dancer wa a sort of green
bank like the terrac in such old-fashion garden

along thi in a kind of crescent stood seven great chair the
throne of the seven day gogol and dr bull were alreadi in their
seats; the professor wa just mount to hi gogol or tuesday
had hi simplic well symbolis by a dress design upon the
divis of the water a dress that separ upon hi forehead
and fell to hi feet grey and silver like a sheet of rain the
professor whose day wa that on which the bird and fishes--th
ruder form of life--wer creat had a dress of dim purpl over
which sprawl goggle-ey fish and outrag tropic bird
the union in him of unfathom fanci and of doubt dr bull the
last day of creation wore a coat cover with herald anim in
red and gold and on hi crest a man rampant he lay back in hi
chair with a broad smile the pictur of an optimist in hi
element

one by one the wander ascend the bank and sat in their
strang seat as each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose
from the carniv such as that with which crowd receiv king
cup were clash and torch shaken and feather hat flung in
the air the men for whom these throne were reserv were men
crown with some extraordinari laurel but the central chair wa
empti

syme wa on the left hand of it and the secretari on the right
the secretari look across the empti throne at syme and said
compress hi lips--

we do not know yet that he is not dead in a field

almost as syme heard the word he saw on the sea of human face in
front of him a fright and beauti alter as if heaven had
open behind hi head but sunday had onli pass silent along
the front like a shadow and had sat in the central seat he wa
drape plainli in a pure and terribl white and hi hair wa like
a silver flame on hi forehead

for a long time--it seem for hours--that huge masquerad of
mankind sway and stamp in front of them to march and
exult music everi coupl danc seem a separ romance;
it might be a fairi danc with a pillar-box or a peasant girl
danc with the moon; but in each case it wa somehow as
absurd as alic in wonderland yet as grave and kind as a love
stori at last howev the thick crowd began to thin itself
coupl stroll away into the garden-walk or began to drift
toward that end of the build where stood smoke in huge
pot like fish-kettl some hot and scent mixtur of old ale
or wine abov all these upon a sort of black framework on the
roof of the hous roar in it iron basket a gigant bonfir
which lit up the land for mile it flung the home effect of
firelight over the face of vast forest of grey or brown and it
seem to fill with warmth even the empti of upper night
yet thi also after a time wa allow to grow fainter; the
dim group gather more and more round the great cauldron or
pass laugh and clatter into the inner passag of that
ancient hous soon there were onli some ten loiter in the
garden; soon onli four final the last stray merry-mak ran
into the hous whoop to hi companion the fire fade and
the slow strong star came out and the seven strang men were
left alon like seven stone statu on their chair of stone
not one of them had spoken a word

they seem in no hast to do so but heard in silenc the hum of
insect and the distant song of one bird then sunday spoke but
so dreamili that he might have been continu a convers
rather than begin one

we will eat and drink later he said let us remain togeth a
littl we who have love each other so sadli and have fought so
long i seem to rememb onli centuri of heroic war in which
you were alway heroes--ep on epic iliad on iliad and you
alway brother in arm whether it wa but recent (for time is
nothing) or at the begin of the world i sent you out to
war i sat in the dark where there is not ani creat thing
and to you i wa onli a voic command valour and an unnatur
virtu you heard the voic in the dark and you never heard it
again the sun in heaven deni it the earth and sky deni it
all human wisdom deni it and when i met you in the daylight i
deni it myself

syme stir sharpli in hi seat but otherwis there wa silenc
and the incomprehens went on

but you were men you did not forget your secret honour though
the whole cosmo turn an engin of tortur to tear it out of
you i knew how near you were to hell i know how you thursday
cross sword with king satan and how you wednesday name me
in the hour without hope

there wa complet silenc in the starlit garden and then the
black-brow secretari implac turn in hi chair toward
sunday and said in a harsh voice--

who and what are you?

i am the sabbath said the other without move i am the peac
of god

the secretari start up and stood crush hi costli robe in hi
hand

i know what you mean he cri and it is exactli that that i
cannot forgiv you i know you are content optim what do
they call the thing an ultim reconcili well i am not
reconcil if you were the man in the dark room whi were you also
sunday an offens to the sunlight? if you were from the first our
father and our friend whi were you also our greatest enemy? we
wept we fled in terror; the iron enter into our souls--and you
are the peac of god! oh i can forgiv god hi anger though it
destroy nations; but i cannot forgiv him hi peac

sunday answer not a word but veri slowli he turn hi face of
stone upon syme as if ask a question

no said syme i do not feel fierc like that i am grate
to you not onli for wine and hospit here but for mani a
fine scamper and free fight but i should like to know my soul
and heart are as happi and quiet here as thi old garden but my
reason is still cri out i should like to know

sunday look at ratcliff whose clear voic said--

it seem so silli that you should have been on both side and
fought yourself

bull said--

l understand noth but i am happi in fact i am go to
sleep

i am not happi said the professor with hi head in hi hand
becaus i do not understand you let me stray a littl too near
to hell

and then gogol said with the absolut simplic of a child--

i wish i knew whi i wa hurt so much

still sunday said noth but onli sat with hi mighti chin upon
hi hand and gaze at the distanc then at last he said--

i have heard your complaint in order and here i think come
anoth to complain and we will hear him also

the fall fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam like
a bar of burn gold across the dim grass against thi fieri
band wa outlin in utter black the advanc leg of a black-clad
figur he seem to have a fine close suit with knee-breech such
as that which wa worn by the servant of the hous onli that it
wa not blue but of thi absolut sabl he had like the
servant a kind of word by hi side it wa onli when he had come
quit close to the crescent of the seven and flung up hi face to
look at them that syme saw with thunder-struck clear that
the face wa the broad almost ape-lik face of hi old friend
gregori with it rank red hair and it insult smile

gregory! gasp syme half-ris from hi seat whi thi is
the real anarchist!

ye said gregori with a great and danger restraint i am
the real anarchist

now there wa a day murmur bull who seem realli to have
fallen asleep when the son of god came to present themselv
befor the lord and satan came also among them

you are right said gregori and gaze all round i am a
destroy i would destroy the world if i could

a sens of a patho far under the earth stir up in syme and
he spoke brokenli and without sequenc

oh most unhappi man he cri tri to be happy! you have red
hair like your sister

my red hair like red flame shall burn up the world said
gregori i thought i hate everyth more than common men can
hate anything; but i find that i do not hate everyth so much
as i hate you!

i never hate you said syme veri sadli

then out of thi unintellig creatur the last thunder broke

you! he cri you never hate becaus you never live i know
what you are all of you from first to last--you are the peopl
in power! you are the police--th great fat smile men in blue
and buttons! you are the law and you have never been broken but
is there a free soul aliv that doe not long to break you onli
becaus you have never been broken? we in revolt talk all kind of
nonsens doubtless about thi crime or that crime of the
govern it is all folly! the onli crime of the govern is
that it govern the unpardon sin of the suprem power is
that it is suprem i do not curs you for be cruel i do not
curs you (though i might) for be kind i curs you for be
safe! you sit in your chair of stone and have never come down
from them you are the seven angel of heaven and you have had
no troubl oh i could forgiv you everyth you that rule
all mankind if i could feel for onc that you had suffer for
one hour a real agoni such as i--

syme sprang to hi feet shake from head to foot

i see everyth he cri everyth that there is whi doe
each thing on the earth war against each other thing? whi doe
each small thing in the world have to fight against the world
itself? whi doe a fli have to fight the whole universe? whi doe
a dandelion have to fight the whole universe? for the same reason
that i had to be alon in the dread council of the day so
that each thing that obey law may have the glori and isol of
the anarchist so that each man fight for order may be as brave
and good a man as the dynamit so that the real lie of satan may
be flung back in the face of thi blasphem so that by tear and
tortur we may earn the right to say to thi man you lie! no
agoni can be too great to buy the right to say to thi accus
we also have suffer

it is not true that we have never been broken we have been broken
upon the wheel it is not true that we have never descend from
these throne we have descend into hell we were complain of
unforgett miseri even at the veri moment when thi man
enter insol to accus us of happi i repel the slander;
we have not been happi i can answer for everi one of the great
guard of law whom he ha accus at least--

he had turn hi eye so as to see suddenli the great face of
sunday which wore a strang smile

have you he cri in a dread voic have you ever suffered?

as he gaze the great face grew to an aw size grew larger than
the coloss mask of memnon which had made him scream as a child
it grew larger and larger fill the whole sky; then everyth
went black onli in the black befor it entir destroy hi
brain he seem to hear a distant voic say a commonplac text
that he had heard somewher can ye drink of the cup that i drink
of?

* * *

when men in book awak from a vision they commonli find
themselv in some place in which they might have fallen asleep;
they yawn in a chair or lift themselv with bruis limb from a
field syme experi wa someth much more psycholog
strang if there wa inde anyth unreal in the earthli sens
about the thing he had gone through for while he could alway
rememb afterward that he had swoon befor the face of sunday
he could not rememb have ever come to at all he could onli
rememb that gradual and natur he knew that he wa and had
been walk along a countri lane with an easi and convers
companion that companion had been a part of hi recent drama; it
wa the red-hair poet gregori they were walk like old
friend and were in the middl of a convers about some
trivial but syme could onli feel an unnatur buoyanc in hi
bodi and a crystal simplic in hi mind that seem to be
superior to everyth that he said or did he felt he wa in
possess of some imposs good news which made everi other
thing a trivial but an ador trivial

dawn wa break over everyth in colour at onc clear and
timid; as if natur made a first attempt at yellow and a first
attempt at rose a breez blew so clean and sweet that one could
not think that it blew from the sky; it blew rather through some
hole in the sky syme felt a simpl surpris when he saw rise all
round him on both side of the road the red irregular build of
saffron park he had no idea that he had walk so near london he
walk by instinct along one white road on which earli bird
hop and sang and found himself outsid a fenc garden there
he saw the sister of gregori the girl with the gold-r hair
cut lilac befor breakfast with the great unconsci graviti
of a girl
