shipwrack storm and direful thunders:
so from that spring whenc comfort seemd to come
discomfort swells: mark king of scotland mark

compelld these skip kern to trust their heel
but the norweyan lord suruey vantag
with furbusht arm and new supply of men
began a fresh assault

king dismayd not thi our captain macbeth and
banquoh?
cap ye as sparrow eagles;
or the hare the lyon:
if i say sooth i must report they were
as cannon ouer-chargd with doubl crack
so they doubli redoubl stroak vpon the foe:
except they meant to bath in reek wound
or memor anoth golgotha
i cannot tell: but i am faint
my gash cri for help

king so well thi word becom thee as thi wound
they smack of honor both: goe get him surgeon

nor would we deign him burial of hi men
till he disburs at saint colm ynch
ten thousand dollar to our general vse

and with hi former titl greet macbeth

whom you may say (ift pleas you) flean killd
for flean fled: men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrou
it wa for malcolm and for donalban
to kill their graciou father? damn fact
how it did greeue macbeth? did he not straight
in piou rage the two delinqu tear
that were the slaue of drink and thrall of sleepe?
wa not that nobli done? i and wise too:
for twould haue angerd ani heart aliu
to hear the men denyt so that i say
he ha born all thing well and i do think
that had he duncan sonn vnder hi key
(a andt pleas heauen he shall not) they should find
what twere to kill a father: so should flean
but peace; for from broad word and caus he fayld
hi presenc at the tyrant feast i hear

of the most piou edward with such grace
that the maleuol of fortun noth
take from hi high respect thither macduff

to wake northumberland and warlik seyward
that by the help of these (with him aboue)
to ratifi the worke) we may again
giue to our tabl meat sleep to our nights:
free from our feast and banquet bloodi kniues;
do faithful homag and receiu free honor
all which we pine for now and thi report
hath so exasper their king that hee
