the orphan

near the ruin of the castl of rossmor in ireland is a small cabin
in which there onc live a widow and her four children as long as she
wa abl to work she wa veri industri and wa account the best
spinner in the parish; but she overwork herself at last and fell ill
so that she could not sit to her wheel as she use to do and wa oblig
to give it up to her eldest daughter mari

mari wa at thi time about twelv year old one even she wa
sit at the foot of her mother bed spin and her littl brother
and sister were gather round the fire eat their potato and milk
for supper bless them the poor young creatures! said the widow who
as she lay on her bed which she knew must be her deathb wa think
of what would becom of her children after she wa gone mari stop
her wheel for she wa afraid that the nois of it had waken her
mother and would hinder her from go to sleep again

no need to stop the wheel mari dear for me said her mother i wa
not asleep; nor is it that which keep me from sleep but dont overwork
yourself mari

oh no fear of that repli mary; im strong and hearti

so wa i onc said her mother

and so you will be again i hope said mari when the fine weather

the fine weather will never come again to me said her mother ti a
folli mari to hope for that; but what i hope is that youll find some
friend--som help--orphan as youll soon all of you be and one thing
comfort my heart even as i am lie here that not a soul in the wide
world i am leav ha to complain of me though poor i have live
honest and i have brought you up to be the same mary; and i am sure the
littl one will take after you; for youll be good to them--a good to
them as you can

here the children who had finish eat their supper came round the
bed to listen to what their mother wa say she wa tire of
speak for she wa veri weak; but she took their littl hand as they
laid them on the bed and join them all togeth she said bless you
dears; bless you; love and help one anoth all you can good night!--
good-bye!

mari took the children away to their bed for she saw that their mother
wa too ill to say more; but mari did not herself know how ill she wa
her mother never spoke rightli afterward but talk in a confus way
about some debt and one in particular which she owe to a
schoolmistress for mari schooling; and then she charg mari to go and
pay it becaus she wa not abl to go in with it at the end of the
week she wa dead and buri and the orphan were left alon in their
cabin

the two youngest girl peggi and nanci were six and seven year old
edmund wa not yet nine but he wa a stout-grown healthi boy and well
dispos to work he had been use to bring home turf from the bog on
hi back to lead cart-hors and often to go on errand for gentlemen
famili who paid him a sixpenc or a shill accord to the
distanc which he went so that edmund by some or other of these littl
employ wa as he said like enough to earn hi bread; and he
told mari to have a good heart for that he should everi year grow abl
to do more and more and that he should never forget hi mother word
when she last gave him her bless and join their hand all togeth

as for peggi and nanci it wa littl that they could do; but they were
good children and mari when she consid that so much depend upon
her wa resolv to exert herself to the utmost her first care wa to
pay those debt which her mother had mention to her for which she left
money done up care in separ paper when all these were paid
away there wa not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a
year school for herself and sister which wa due to the
schoolmistress in a neighbour villag

mari wa in hope that the rent would not be call for immedi but
in thi she wa disappoint mr harvey the gentleman on whose estat
she live wa in england and in hi absenc all wa manag by a mr
hopkin an agent who wa a hard man* the driver came to mari about a
week after her mother death and told her that the rent must be brought
in the next day and that she must leav the cabin for a new tenant wa
come into it; that she wa too young to have a hous to herself and
that the onli thing she had to do wa to get some neighbour to take her
and her brother and her sister in for chariti sake

*a hard-heart man

the driver finish by hint that she would not be so hardli use if
she had not brought upon herself the ill-wil of miss alic the agent
daughter mari it is true had refus to give miss alic a goat upon
which she had set her fancy; but thi wa the onli offenc of which she
had been guilti and at the time she refus it her mother want the
goat milk which wa the onli thing she then like to drink

mari went immedi to mr hopkin the agent to pay her rent; and she
beg of him to let her stay anoth year in her cabin; but thi he
refus it wa now septemb 25th and he said that the new tenant must
come in on the 29th so that she must quit it directli mari could not
bear the thought of beg ani of the neighbour to take her and her
brother and sister in for chariti sake; for the neighbour were all
poor enough themselv so she bethought herself that she might find
shelter in the ruin of the old castl of rossmor where she and her
brother in better time had often play at hide and seek the kitchen
and two other room near it were yet cover in toler well; and a
littl thatch she thought would make them comfort through the
winter the agent consent to let her and her brother and sister go in
there upon her pay him half a guinea in hand and promis to pay
the same yearli

into these lodg the orphan now remov take with them two
bedstead a stool chair and a tabl a sort of press which contain
what littl cloth they had and a chest in which they had two hundr
of meal the chest wa carri for them by some of the charit
neighbour who likewis ad to their scanti stock of potato and turf
what would make it last through the winter

these children were well thought of and piti becaus their mother wa
known to have been all her life honest and industri sure say one
of the neighbour we can do no less than give a help hand to the
poor orphan that are so readi to help themselv so one help to
thatch the room in which they were to sleep and anoth took their cow
to graze upon hi bit of land on condit of have half the milk; and
one and all said they should be welcom to take share of their potato
and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short

the half-guinea which mr hopkin the agent requir for let mari
into the castl wa part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress
to whom abov a guinea wa due mari went to her and took her goat
along with her and offer it in part of payment of the debt but the
schoolmistress would not receiv the goat she said that she could afford
to wait for her money till mari wa abl to pay it; that she knew her to
be an honest industri littl girl and she would trust her with more
than a guinea mari thank her; and she wa glad to take the goat home
again as she wa veri fond of it

be now settl in their hous they went everi day regularli to work;
maud spun nine cut a day besid do all that wa to be done in the
house; edmund got fourpenc a day by hi work; and peggi and anni earn
twopenc apiec at the paper-mil near navan where they were employ
to sort rag and to cut them into small piec

when they had done work one day anni went to the master of the paper-
mill and ask him if she might have two sheet of larg white paper
which were lie on the press she offer a penni for the paper; but
the master would not take anyth from her but gave her the paper when
he found that she want it to make a garland for her mother grave
anni and peggi cut out the garland and mari when it wa finish went
along with them and edmund to put it up it wa just a month after their
mother death

it happen at the time the orphan were put up thi garland that
two young ladi who were return home after their even walk
stop at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the
set sun cast upon the window of the church as the ladi were
stand at the gate they heard a voic near them cri o mother!
mother! are you gone for ever? they could not see anyon so they
walk softli round to the other side of the church and there they saw
mari kneel besid a grave on which her brother and sister were
hang their white garland

the children all stood still when they saw the two ladi pass near
them; but mari did not know anybodi wa pass for her face wa hid in
her hand

isabella and carolin (so these ladi were called) would not disturb the
poor children; but they stop in the villag to inquir about them it
wa at the hous of the schoolmistress that they stop and she gave
them a good account of these orphan she particularli commend mari
honesti in have immedi paid all her mother debt to the utmost
farth as far as her money would go she told the ladi how mari had
been turn out of her hous and how she had offer her goat of which
she wa veri fond to discharg a debt due for her schooling; and in
short the schoolmistress who had known mari for sever year spoke so
well of her that these ladi resolv that they would go to the old
castl of rossmor to see her the next day

when they went there they found the room in which the children live as
clean and neat as such a ruin place could be made edmund wa out
work with a farmer mari wa spin and her littl sister were
measur out some bogberri of which they had gather a basket
for sale isabella after tell mari what an excel charact she
had heard of her inquir what it wa she most wanted; and mari said
that she had just work up all her flax and she wa most in want of
more flax for her wheel

isabella promis that she would send her a fresh suppli of flax and
carolin bought the bogberri from the littl girl and gave them money
enough to buy a pound of coars cotton for knit as mari said that
she could teach them how to knit

the suppli of flax which isabella sent the next day wa of great
servic to mari as it kept her in employ for abov a month; and when
she sold the yarn which she had spun with it she had money enough to buy
some warm flannel for winter wear besid spin well she had
learn at school to do plain work toler neatli and isabella and
carolin employ her to work for them; by which she earn a great deal
more than she could by spin at her leisur hour she taught her
sister to read and write; and edmund with part of the money which he
earn by hi work out of door paid a schoolmast for teach him a
littl arithmet when the winter night came on he use to light hi
rush candl for mari to work by he had gather and strip a good
provis of rush in the month of august and a neighbour gave him
greas to dip them in

one even just as he had light hi candl a footman came in who
wa sent by isabella with some plain work to mari thi servant wa an
englishman and he wa but newli come over to ireland the rush candl
caught hi attention; for he had never seen ani of them befor as he
came from a part of england where they were not use edmund who wa
readi to oblig and proud that hi candl were notic show the
englishman how they were made and gave him a bundl of rushes*

[*the proper speci of rush say white in hi natur histori of
selborn seem to be the juncu effusu or common soft rush which is
to be found in moist pastur by the side of stream and under
hedg these rush are in best condit in the height of summer but
may be gather so as to serv the purpos well quit on to autumn the
largest and longest are the best decay labour women and children
make it their busi to procur and prepar them as soon as they are
cut they must be flung into water and kept there; for otherwis they
will dri and shrink and the peel will not run when these junci are
thu far prepar they must lie out on the grass to be bleach and take
the dew for some night and afterward be dri in the sun some
address is requir in dip these rush in the scald fat or
grease; but thi knack is also to be attain by practic a pound of
common greas may be procur for fourpenc and about six pound of
greas will dip a pound of rush and one pound of rush may be bought
for one shilling; so that a pound of rush medic and readi for use
will cost three shillings]

the servant wa pleas with hi good natur in thi trifl instanc
and rememb it long after it wa forgotten by edmund whenev hi
master want to send a messeng anywher gilbert (for that wa the
servant name) alway employ hi littl friend edmund whom upon
further acquaint he like better and better he found that edmund
wa both quick and exact in execut commiss

one day after he had wait a great while at a gentleman hous for an
answer to a letter he wa so impati to get home that he ran off
without it when he wa question by gilbert whi he did not bring an
answer he did not attempt to make ani excuse; he did not say there wa
no answer pleas your honour or they bid me not to wait etc; but
he told exactli the truth; and though gilbert scold him for be so
impati as not to wait yet hi tell the truth wa more to the boy
advantag than ani excus he could have made after thi he wa alway
believ when he said there wa no answer or they bid me not wait;
for gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from be
scold

the orphan continu to assist one anoth in their work accord to
their strength and abilities; and they went on in thi manner for three
year with what mari got by her spin and plain work and edmund by
lead of cart-hors go on errand etc and with littl peggi and
ann earn the famili contriv to live comfort isabella and
carolin often visit them and sometim gave them cloth and
sometim flax or cotton for their spin and knitting; and these
children did not expect that becaus the ladi did someth for them
they should do everyth they did not grow idl or wast

when edmund wa about twelv year old hi friend gilbert sent for him
one day and told him that hi master had given him leav to have a boy
in the hous to assist him and that hi master told him he might choos
one in the neighbourhood sever were anxiou to get into such a good
place: but gilbert said that he prefer edmund befor them all
becaus he knew him to be an industri honest good natur lad who
alway told the truth so edmund went into servic at the vicarage; and
hi master wa the father of isabella and carolin he found hi new way
of life veri pleasant; for he wa well fed well cloth and well
treated; and he everi day learn more of hi busi in which at first
he wa rather awkward he wa mind to do all that mr gilbert
requir of him; and he wa so oblig to all hi fellow-serv that
they could not help like him but there wa one thing which wa at
first rather disagre to him: he wa oblig to wear shoe and
stock and they hurt hi feet besid thi when he wait at
dinner he made such a nois in walk that hi fellow-serv laugh
at him he told hi sister mari of hi distress and she made for him
after mani trial a pair of cloth shoe with sole of plat hemp*
in these he could walk without make the least noise; and as these shoe
could not be worn out of door he wa alway sure to chang them befor
he went out; and consequ he had alway clean shoe to wear in the
hous

[*the author ha seen a pair of shoe such as here describ made in a
few hours]

it wa soon remark by the men-serv that he had left off clump so
heavili and it wa observ by the maid that he never dirti the
stair or passag with hi shoe when he wa prais for these thing
he said it wa hi sister mari who should be thank and not he; and he
show the shoe which she had made for him

isabella maid bespok a pair immedi and sent mari a piec of
pretti calico for the outsid the last-mak made a last for her and
over thi mari sew the calico vamp tight her brother advis her to
tri plat packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that
thi look more neat than the hemp sole and wa like to last longer
she plat the packthread togeth in strand of about half an inch
thick and these were serv firmli togeth at the bottom of the shoe
when they were finish they fit well and the maid show them to her
mistress

isabella and carolin were so well pleas with mari ingenu and
kind to her brother that they bespok from her two dozen of these
shoe and gave her three yard of colour fustian to make them of and
galloon for the bind when the shoe were complet isabella and
carolin dispos of them for her amongst their acquaint and got
three shill a pair for them the young ladi as soon as they had
collect the money walk to the old castl where they found
everyth neat and clean as usual they had great pleasur in give to
thi industri girl the reward of her ingenu which she receiv
with some surpris and more gratitud they advis her to continu the
shoemak trade as they found the shoe were like and they knew that
they could have a sale for them at the repositori in dublin

mari encourag by these kind friend went on with her littl
manufactur with increas activ peggi and ann plat the
packthread and bast the vamp and line togeth readi for her
edmund wa allow to come home for an hour everi morn provid he
wa back again befor eight oclock it wa summer time and he got up
earli becaus he like to go home to see hi sister and he took hi
share in the manufactori it wa hi busi to hammer the sole flat:
and as soon as he came home everi morn he perform hi task with so
much cheer and sang so merrili at hi work that the hour of hi
arriv wa alway an hour of joy to the famili

mari had present employ enough upon her hand order came to her
for shoe from mani famili in the neighbourhood and she could not get
them finish fast enough she howev in the midst of her hurri
found time to make a veri pretti pair with neat rose as a present for
her schoolmistress who now that she saw her pupil in a good way of
busi consent to receiv the amount of her old debt sever of
the children who went to her school were delight with the sight of
mari present and went to the littl manufactori at rossmor castl to
find out how these shoe were made some went from curios other
from idleness; but when they saw how happi the littl shoemak seem
whilst busi at work they long to take some share in what wa go
forward one beg mari to let her plat some packthread for the soles;
anoth help peggi and ann to bast in the linings; and all who could
get employ were pleas for the idl one were shove out of the
way it becam a custom with the children of the villag to resort to
the old castl at their play hours; and it wa surpris to see how much
wa done by ten or twelv of them each do but a littl at a time

one morn edmund and the littl manufactur were assembl veri
earli and they were busi at their work all sit round the meal
chest which serv them for a tabl

my hand must be wash said georg a littl boy who came run in;
i ran so fast that i might be in time to go to work along with you all
that i tumbl down and look how i have dirti my hand most hast
worst speed my hand must be wash befor i can do anyth

whilst georg wa wash hi hand two other littl children who had
just finish their morn work came to him to beg that he would blow
some soap bubbl for them and they were all three eagerli blow
bubbl and watch them mount into the air when suddenli they were
startl by a nois as loud as thunder they were in a sort of outer
court of the castl next to the room in which all their companion were
at work and they ran precipit into the room exclaim did you
hear that noise?

i thought i heard a clap of thunder said mari but whi do you look so
frightened?

as she finish speak anoth and a louder nois and the wall round
about them shook the children turn pale and stood motionless; but
edmund threw down hi hammer and ran out to see what wa the matter
mari follow him and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruin at
the farthest side of the castl had fallen down and thi wa the caus
of the prodigi nois

the part of the castl in which they live seem as edmund said to be
perfectli safe; but the children of the villag were terrifi and
think that the whole would come tumbl down directli they ran to
their home as fast as they could edmund who wa a courag lad and
proud of show hi courag laugh at their cowardice; but mari who
wa veri prudent persuad her brother to ask an experienc mason who
wa build at hi master to come and give hi opinion whether their
part of the castl wa safe to live in or not the mason came and gave
it as hi opinion that the room they inhabit might last through the
winter but that no part of the ruin could stand anoth year mari wa
sorri to leav a place of which she had grown fond poor as it wa
have live in it in peac and content ever sinc her mother
death which wa now nearli four years; but she determin to look out
for some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the
rent of a comfort cabin without lose ani time she went to the
villag that wa at the end of the avenu lead to the vicarag for
she wish to get a lodg in thi villag becaus it wa so near to her
brother and to the ladi who had been so kind to her she found that
there wa one newli built hous in thi villag unoccupied; it belong
to mr harvey her landlord who wa still in england; it wa slate and
neatli fit up inside; but the rent of it wa six guinea a year and
thi wa far abov what mari could afford to pay three guinea a year
she thought wa the highest rent for which she could ventur to engag
besid she heard that sever propos had been made to mr harvey for
thi hous and she knew that mr hopkin the agent wa not her friend;
therefor she despair of get it there wa no other to be had in
thi villag her brother wa still more vex than she wa that she
could not find a place near him he offer to give a guinea yearli
toward the rent out of hi wages; and mr gilbert spoke about it for him
to the steward and inquir whether amongst ani of those who had given
in propos there might not be one who would be content with a part of
the hous and who would join with mari in pay the rent none could
be found but a woman who wa a great scold and a man who wa famou for
go to law about everi trifl with hi neighbour mari did not choos
to have anyth to do with these peopl she did not like to speak
either to miss isabella or carolin about it becaus she wa not of an
encroach temper; and when they had done so much for her she would
have been asham to beg for more she return home to the old castl
mortifi that she had no good news to tell ann and peggi who she knew
expect to hear that she had found a nice hous for them in the villag
near their brother

bad news for you peggi cri she as soon as she got home and bad
news for you mari repli her sister who look veri sorrow

what the matter?

your poor goat is dead repli peggi there she is yonder lie
under the great corner stone; you can just see her leg we cannot lift
the stone from off her it is so heavi betsi [one of the neighbour
girls] say she rememb when she came to us to work earli thi
morn she saw the goat rub itself and but with it horn
against that old totter chimney

mani the time said mari that i have driven the poor thing away
from that place; i wa alway afraid she would shake that great ugli
stone down upon her at last

the goat who had long been the favourit of mari and her sister wa
lament by them all when edmund came he help them to move the great
stone from off the poor anim who wa crush so as to be a terribl
sight as they were move away thi stone in order to buri the goat
ann found an odd-look piec of money which seem neither like a
halfpenni nor a shill nor a guinea

here are more a great mani more of them cri peggy; and upon
search amongst the rubbish they discov a small iron pot which
seem as if it had been fill with these coin as a vast number of
them were found about the spot where it fell on examin these coin
edmund thought that sever of them look like gold and the girl
exclaim with great joy--oh mary! mary! thi is come to us just in
right time--now you can pay for the slate hous never wa anyth so
lucky!

but mari though noth could have pleas her better than to have been
abl to pay for the hous observ that they could not honestli touch
ani of thi treasur as it belong to the owner of the castl edmund
agre with her that they ought to carri it all immedi to mr
hopkin the agent peggi and ann were convinc by what mari said and
they beg to go along with her and their brother to take the coin to
mr hopkin on their way they stop at the vicarag to show the
treasur to mr gilbert who took it to the young ladi isabella and
carolin and told them how it had been found

it is not onli by their superior rich but it is yet more by their
superior knowledg that person in the higher rank of life may assist
those in a lower condit

isabella who had some knowledg of chemistri discov by touch
the coin with nitric acid that sever of them were of gold and
consequ of great valu carolin also found out that mani of the
coin were veri valuabl as curios she recollect her father
have shown to her the print of the coin at the end of each king
reign in rapin histori of england; and upon compar these
impress with the coin found by the orphan she perceiv that mani
of them were of the reign of henri the seventh which from their
scarciti were highli appreci by numismat collector

isabella and carolin know someth of the charact of mr hopkin
the agent had the precaut to count the coin and to mark each of
them with a cross so small that it wa scarc visibl to the nake
eye though it wa easili to be seen through a magnifi glass they
also beg that their father who wa well acquaint with mr harvey
the gentleman to whom rossmor castl belong to write to him and tell
him how well these orphan had behav about the treasur which they had
found the valu of the coin wa estim at about thirti or forti
guinea

a few day after the fall of the chimney at rossmor castl as mari and
her sister were sit at their work there came hobbl in an old
woman lean on a crab stick that seem to have been newli cut she
had a broken tobacco-pip in her mouth; her head wa wrap up in two
larg red and blue handkerchief with their crook corner hang far
down over the back of her neck no shoe on her broad feet nor stock
on her many-colour leg her petticoat wa jag at the bottom and
the skirt of her gown turn up over her shoulder to serv instead of a
cloak which she had sold for whiski thi old woman wa well known
amongst the countri peopl by the name of goodi grope:* becaus she had
for mani year been in the habit of grope in old castl and in
moats** and at the bottom of a round tower*** in the neighbourhood in
search of treasur in her youth she had heard someon talk in a
whisper of an old propheci found in a bog which said that befor mani

st patrick day should come about
there would be found
a treasur under ground
by one within twenti mile round

thi propheci made a deep impress upon her she also dream of it
three times: and as the dream she thought wa a sure token that the
propheci wa to come true she from that time forward gave up her
spinning-wheel and her knit and could think of noth but hunt
for the treasur that wa to be found by one within twenti mile
round

[*goodi is not a word use in ireland collyogh is the irish appel
of an old woman: but as collyogh might sound strang to english ear
we have translat it by the word goodi
**what are in ireland call moat are in england call danish
mound or barrow
***near kell in ireland there is a round tower which wa in immin
danger of be pull down by an old woman root at it foundat
in hope of find treasure]

year after year st patrick day came about without her ever find a
farth by all her groping; and as she wa alway idl she grew poorer
and poorer besid to comfort herself for her disappoint and to
give her spirit for fresh search she took to drink she sold all
she had by degrees; but still she fanci that the lucki day would come
sooner or later that would pay for all

goodi grope howev reach her sixtieth year without ever see thi
lucki day; and now in her old age she wa a beggar without a hous to
shelter her a bed to lie on or food to put into her mouth but what she
beg from the chariti of those who had trust more than she had to
industri and less to luck

ah mari honey! give me a potato and a sup of someth for the love
o mercy; for not a bit have i had all day except half a glass of whiski
and a halfpenni worth of tobacco!

mari immedi set befor her some milk and pick a good potato out
of the bowl for her she wa sorri to see such an old woman in such a
wretch condit goodi grope said she would rather have spirit of
some kind or other than milk; but mari had no spirit to give her; so she
sat herself down close to the fire and after she had sigh and groan
and smoke for some time she said to mari well and what have you done
with the treasur you had the luck to find? mari told her that she had
carri it to mr hopkin the agent

that not what i would have done in your place repli the old woman
when good luck came to you what a shame to turn your back upon it! but
it is idl talk of what done--that past; but ill tri my luck in
thi here castl befor next st patrick day come about i wa told
it wa more than twenti mile from our bog or i would have been here long
ago; but better late than never

mari wa much alarm and not without reason at thi speech; for she
knew that if goodi grope onc set to work at the foundat of the old
castl of rossmor she would soon bring it all down it wa in vain to
talk to goodi grope of the danger of buri herself under the ruin or
of the improb of her meet with anoth pot of gold coin she
set her elbow upon her knee and stop her ear with her hand bid
mari and her sister not to wast their breath advis their elders; for
that let them say what they would she would fall to work the next
morn bar youll make it worth my while to let it alon

and what will make it worth your while to let it alone? said mary; for
she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her
habit or compli with the condit of thi provok old woman

half a crown goodi grope said wa the least she could be content to
take mari paid the half-crown and wa in hope that she had got rid
for ever of her tormentor but she wa mistaken for scarc wa the
week at an end befor the old woman appear befor her again and
repeat her threat of fall to work the next morn unless she had
someth given to her to buy tobacco

the next day and the next and the next goodi grope came on the same
errand and poor mari who could ill-afford to suppli her constantli with
halfpenc at last exclaim i am sure the find of thi treasur ha
not been ani good luck to us but quit the contrary; and i wish we never
had found it

mari did not yet know how much she wa to suffer on account of thi
unfortun pot of gold coin mr hopkin the agent imagin that no
one knew of the discoveri of thi treasur but himself and these poor
children; so not be as honest as they were he resolv to keep it
for hi own use he wa surpris some week afterward to receiv a
letter from hi employ mr harvey demand from him the coin which
had been discov at rossmor castl hopkin had sold the gold coin
and some of the others; and he flatter himself that the children and
the young ladi to whom he now found they had been shown could not
tell whether what they had seen were gold or not and he wa not in the
least apprehens that those of henri the seventh reign should be
reclaim from him as he thought they had escap attent so he sent
over the silver coin and other of littl valu and apolog for hi
not have mention them befor by say that he consid them as
mere rubbish

mr harvey in repli observ that he could not consid as rubbish the
gold coin which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he
inquir whi these gold coin and those of the reign of henri the
seventh were not now sent to him

mr hopkin deni that he had ever receiv ani such; but he wa
thunderstruck when mr harvey in repli to thi falsehood sent him a
list of the coin which the orphan had deposit with him and exact
draw of those that were miss he inform him that thi list and
these draw came from two ladi who had seen the coin in question

mr hopkin thought that he had no mean of escap but by boldli
persist in falsehood he repli that it wa veri like such coin
had been found at rossmor castl and that the ladi allud to had
probabl seen them; but he posit declar that they never came to
hi hands; that he had restor all that were deposit with him; and
that as to the other he suppos they must have been taken out of the
pot by the children or by edmund or mari on their way from the ladi
hous to hi

the orphan were shock and astonish when they heard from isabella
and carolin the charg that wa made against them they look at one
anoth in silenc for some moment then peggi exclaimed--sure! mr
hopkin ha forgotten himself strang doe not he rememb edmund
count the thing to him upon the great tabl in hi hall and we all
stand by! i rememb it as well as if it wa thi instant

and so do i cri ann and dont you recollect mari your pick
out the gold one and tell mr hopkin that they were gold; and he
said you knew noth of the matter; and i wa go to tell him that
miss isabella had tri them and knew that they were gold? but just then
there came in some tenant to pay their rent and he push us out and
twitch from my hand the piec of gold which i had taken up to show him
the bright spot which miss isabella had clean by the stuff that she had
pour on it? i believ he wa afraid i should steal it; he twitch it
from my hand in such a hurri do edmund; do mary--let us go to him
and put him in mind of all thi

ill go to him no more said edmund sturdili he is a bad man--il
never go to him again mari dont be cast down--w have no need to be
cast down--w are honest

true said mary; but is not it a hard case that we who have live as
my mother did all her life befor us in peac and honesti with all the
world should now have our good name taken from us when-- mari voic
falter and stop

it cant be taken from us cri edmund poor orphan though we are
and he a rich gentleman as he call himself let him say and do what he
will he cant hurt our good name

edmund wa mistaken alas! and mari had but too much reason for her
fear the affair wa a great deal talk of; and the agent spare no
pain to have the stori told hi own way the orphan consciou of
their own innoc took no pain about the matter; and the consequ
wa that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but mani
who knew noth of them conclud that the agent must be in the right
and the children in the wrong the buzz of scandal went on for some time
without reach their ear becaus they live veri retiredli but one
day when mari went to sell some stock of peggi knit at the
neighbour fair the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name
on the back of a note and exclaim on see it--ho! ho! mistress;
id not have had ani deal with you had i known your name sooner
where the gold that you found at rossmor castle?

it wa in vain that mari relat the fact she saw that she gain no
belief as her charact wa not known to thi man or to ani of those
who were present she left the fair as soon as she could; and though she
struggl against it she felt veri melancholi still she exert
herself everi day at her littl manufacture; and she endeavour to
consol herself by reflect that she had two friend left who would not
give up her charact and who continu steadili to protect her and her
sister

isabella and carolin everywher assert their belief in the integr
of the orphan but to prove it wa in thi instanc out of their power
mr hopkin the agent and hi friend constantli repeat that the
gold coin were taken away in come from their hous to his; and these
ladi were blame by mani peopl for continu to counten those
that were with great reason suspect to be thiev the orphan were
in a wors condit than ever when the winter came on and their
benefactress left the countri to spend some month in dublin the old
castl it wa true wa like to last through the winter as the mason
said; but though the want of a comfort hous to live in wa a littl
while ago the uppermost thing in mari thought now it wa not so

one night as mari wa go to bed she heard someon knock hard at
the door mari are you up? let us in cri a voic which she knew
to be the voic of betsi green the postmast daughter who live in
the villag near them

she let betsi in and ask what she could want at such a time of night

give me sixpenc and ill tell you said betsy; but waken ann and
peggi here a letter just come by post for you and i step over to
you with it; becaus i guess youd be glad to have it see it is
your brother handwrit

peggi and ann were soon rous when they heard that there wa a letter
from edmund it wa by one of hi rush candl that mari read it; and
the letter wa as follows:--

dear mari nanci and littl peg--

joy! joy!--i alway said the truth would come out at last; and that he
could not take our good name from us but i will not tell you how it all
came about till we meet which will be next week as we are (i mean
master and mistress and the young ladies--bless them!--and mr gilbert
and i) come down to the vicarag to keep christmas; and a happi
christma ti like to be for honest folk as for they that are not
honest it is not for them to expect to be happi at christma or ani
other time you shall know all when we meet so till then fare ye
well dear mari nanci and littl peg
your joy and affection brother edmund

to comprehend whi edmund is joy our reader must be inform of
certain thing which happen after isabella and carolin went to dublin
one morn they went with their father and mother to see the magnific
librari of a nobleman who took gener and polit pleasur in thu
share the advantag of hi wealth and station with all who had ani
pretens to scienc or literatur know that the gentleman who wa
now come to see hi librari wa skill in antiqu the nobleman
open a drawer of medal to ask hi opinion concern the age of some
coin which he had late purchas at a high price they were the veri
same which the orphan had found at rossmor castl isabella and
carolin knew them again instantly; and as the cross which isabella had
made on each of them wa still visibl through a magnifi glass there
could be no possibl of doubt

the nobleman who wa much interest both by the stori of these orphan
and the manner in which it wa told to him sent immedi for the
person from whom he had purchas the coin he wa a jew broker at
first he refus to tell them from whom he got them becaus he had
bought them he said under a promis of secreci be further press
he acknowledg that it wa made a condit in hi bargain that he
should not sell them to anyon in ireland but that he had been tempt
by the high price the present nobl possessor had offer

at last when the jew wa inform that the coin were stolen and that
he would be proceed against as a receiv of stolen good if he did
not confess the whole truth he declar that he had purchas them from
a gentleman whom he had never seen befor or since; but he ad that
he could swear to hi person if he saw him again

now mr hopkin the agent wa at thi time in dublin and carolin
father post the jew the next day in the back-parlour of a banker
hous with whom mr hopkin had on thi day appoint to settl some
account mr hopkin came--th jew knew him--swor that he wa the man
who had sold the coin to him; and thu the guilt of the agent and the
innoc of the orphan were complet prove

a full account of all that happen wa sent to england to mr harvey
their landlord and a few post afterward there came a letter from him
contain a dismiss of the dishonest agent and a reward for the
honest and industri orphan mr harvey desir that mari and her
sister might have the slate hous rent free from thi time forward
under the care of ladi isabella and carolin as long as mari or her
sister should carri on in it ani use busi thi wa the joy
news which edmund had to tell hi sister

all the neighbour share in their joy and the day of their remov from
the ruin of rossmor castl to their new hous wa the happiest of the
christma holiday they were not envi for their prosperity; becaus
everybodi saw that it wa the reward of their good conduct; everybodi
except goodi grope she exclaim as she wrung her hand with violent
express of sorrow--bad luck to me! bad luck to me!--whi didnt i go
sooner to that there castle? it is all luck all luck in thi world; but
i never had no luck think of the luck of these childer that have found
a pot of gold and such great grand friend and a slate hous and
all: and here am i with scarc a rag to cover me and not a potato to
put into my mouth!--i that have been look under ground all my day
for treasur not to have a halfpenni at the last to buy me tobacco!

that is the veri reason that you have not a halfpenni said betsi
here mari ha been work hard and so have her two littl sister and
her brother for these five year past; and they have made money for
themselv by their own industry--and friend too--not by luck but by--

phoo! phoo! interrupt goodi grope; dont be prating; dont i know as
well as you do that they found a pot of gold by good luck? and is not
that the caus whi they are go to live in a slate hous now?

no repli the postmast daughter; thi hous is given to them as
a reward--that wa the word in the letter; for i saw it edmund show
it to me and will show it to anyon that want to see thi hous wa
given to them as a reward for their honesti



lazi lawrenc

in the pleasant valley of ashton there live an elderli woman of the name
of preston she had a small neat cottag and there wa not a weed to be
seen in her garden it wa upon her garden that she chiefli depend for
support; it consist of strawberri bed and one small border for
flower the pink and rose she tie up in nice nosegay and sent
either to clifton or bristol to be sold as to her strawberri she did
not send them to market becaus it wa the custom for number of peopl
to come from clifton in the summer time to eat strawberri and cream
at the garden in ashton

now the widow preston wa so oblig activ and good-humour that
everyon who came to see her wa pleas she live happili in thi
manner for sever years; but alas! one autumn she fell sick and
dure her ill everyth went wrong; her garden wa neglect her
cow die and all the money which she had save wa spent in pay for
medicin the winter pass away while she wa so weak that she could
earn but littl by her work; and when the summer came her rent wa
call for and the rent wa not readi in her littl purs as usual she
beg a few month delay and they were grant to her; but at the end
of that time there wa no resourc but to sell her hors lightfoot now
lightfoot though perhap he had seen hi best day wa a veri great
favourit in hi youth he had alway carri the dame to the market
behind her husband; and it wa now her littl son jem turn to ride him
it wa jem busi to feed lightfoot and to take care of him--a
charg which he never neglect for besid be a veri good natur
he wa a veri industri boy

it will go near to break my jem heart said dame preston to herself
as she sat one even besid the fire stir the ember and
consid how she had best open the matter to her son who stood
opposit to her eat a dri crust of bread veri heartili for supper

jem said the old woman what art hungry?

that i am brave and hungry!

ay! no wonder youv been brave hard at work--eh?

brave hard! i wish it wa not so dark mother that you might just step
out and see the great bed ive dug; i know youd say it wa no bad day
work--and oh mother! ive good news: farmer truck will give us the
giant strawberri and im to go for em tomorrow morn and ill be
back afor breakfast

god bless the boy! how he talks!--four mile there and four mile back
again afor breakfast

ay upon lightfoot you know mother veri easily; maynt i?

ay child!

whi do you sigh mother?

finish thi supper child

ive done! cri jem swallow the last mouth hastili as if he
thought he had been too long at supper--and now for the great needle; i
must see and mend lightfoot bridl afor i go to bed

to work he set by the light of the fire and the dame have onc more
stir it began again with jem dear doe he go lame at all now?

what lightfoot! oh la no not he--nev wa so well of hi lame
in all hi life he grown quit young again i think and then he so
fat he can hardli wag

god bless him--that right we must see jem and keep him fat

for what mother?

for monday fortnight at the fair he to be--sold!

lightfoot! cri jem and let the bridl fall from hi hand; and will
mother sell lightfoot?

will? no: but i must jem

must! who say you must? whi must you mother?

i must i say child whi must not i pay my debt honestly; and must
not i pay my rent and wa not it call for long and long ago; and have
not i had time; and did not i promis to pay it for certain monday
fortnight and am not i two guinea short; and where am i to get two
guineas? so what signifi talk child? said the widow lean her
head upon her arm lightfoot must go

jem wa silent for a few minutes--two guinea that a great great
deal if i work and work and work ever so hard i could no way
earn two guinea afor monday fortnight--could i mother?

lord help thee no; not an work thyself to death

but i could earn someth though i say cri jem proudly; and i
will earn something--if it be ever so littl it will be something--and i
shall do my veri best; so i will

that im sure of my child said hi mother draw him toward her
and kiss him; you were alway a good industri lad that i will
say afor your face or behind your back;--but it wont do now--lightfoot
must go

jem turn away struggl to hide hi tear and went to bed without
say a word more but he knew that cri would do no good; so he
present wipe hi eye and lay awak consid what he could
possibl do to save the hors if i get ever so littl he still said
to himself it will be something; and who know but landlord might then
wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penni a day
might come to two guinea in time

but how to get the first penni wa the question then he recollect
that one day when he had been sent to clifton to sell some flower he
had seen an old woman with a board besid her cover with variou
sparkl stone which peopl stop to look at as they pass and he
rememb that some peopl bought the stones; one paid twopenc anoth
threepenc and anoth sixpenc for them; and jem heard her say that she
got them amongst the neighbour rocks: so he thought that if he tri
he might find some too and sell them as she had done

earli in the morn he waken full of thi scheme jump up dress
himself and have given one look at poor lightfoot in hi stabl set
off to clifton in search of the old woman to inquir where she found her
sparkl stone but it wa too earli in the morn the old woman wa
not at her seat; so he turn back again disappoint he did not wast
hi time wait for her but saddl and bridl lightfoot and went to
farmer truck for the giant strawberri

a great part of the morn wa spent in put them into the ground;
and as soon as that wa finish he set out again in quest of the old
woman whom to hi great joy he spi sit at her corner of the
street with her board befor her but thi old woman wa deaf and cross;
and when at last jem made her hear hi question he could get no answer
from her but that she found the fossil where he would never find ani
more but cant i look where you looked?

look away nobodi hinder you repli the old woman; and these were
the onli word she would say

jem wa not howev a boy to be easili discouraged; he went to the
rock and walk slowli along look at all the stone as he pass
present he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosen
some larg rock and one amongst the workmen wa stoop down look
for someth veri eagerly; jem ran up and ask if he could help him

ye said the man you can; ive just drop amongst thi heap of
rubbish a fine piec of crystal that i got to-day

what kind of a look thing is it? said jem

white and like glass said the man and went on work whilst jem
look veri care over the heap of rubbish for a great while

come said the man it gone for ever; dont troubl yourself ani
more my boy

it no trouble; ill look a littl longer; well not give it up so
soon said jem; and after he had look a littl longer he found the
piec of crystal

thank said the man you are a fine littl industri fellow

jem encourag by the tone of voic in which the man spoke thi
ventur to ask him the same question which he had ask the old woman

one good turn deserv anoth said the man; we are go to dinner
just now and shall leav off work--wait for me here and ill make it
worth your while

jem waited; and as he wa veri attent observ how the workmen
went on with their work he heard somebodi near him give a great yawn
and turn round he saw stretch upon the grass besid the river a
boy about hi own age who in the villag of ashton as he knew went by
the name of lazi lawrence--a name which he most justli deserv for he
never did anyth from morn to night he neither work nor play
but saunter or loung about restless and yawn hi father wa an
ale-hous keeper and be gener drunk could take no care of hi
son; so that lazi lawrenc grew everi day wors and wors howev some
of the neighbour said that he wa a good natur poor fellow enough
and would never do anyon harm but himself; whilst other who were
wiser often shook their head and told him that idl wa the root
of all evil

what lawrence! cri jem to him when he saw him lie upon the grass;
what are you asleep?

not quit

are you awake?

not quit

what are you do there?

noth

what are you think of?

noth

what make you lie there?

i dont know--becaus i cant find anybodi to play with me to-day will
you come and play?

no i cant; im busi

busi cri lawrenc stretch himself you are alway busi i
would not be you for the world to have so much to do alway

and i said jem laugh would not be you for the world to have
noth to do

they then part for the workman just then call jem to follow him he
took him home to hi own hous and show him a parcel of fossil which
he had gather he said on purpos to sell but had never had time
enough to sell them now howev he set about the task; and have
pick out those which he judg to be the best he put them in a small
basket and gave them to jem to sell upon condit that he should bring
him half of what he got jem pleas to be employ wa readi to agre
to what the man propos provid hi mother had no object when he
went home to dinner he told hi mother hi scheme and she smile and
said he might do as he pleased; for she wa not afraid of hi be from
home you are not an idl boy said she; so there is littl danger of
your get into ani mischief

accordingli jem that even took hi stand with hi littl basket upon
the bank of the river just at the place where peopl land from a ferry-
boat and the walk turn to the well and number of peopl perpetu
pass to drink the water he chose hi place well and wait nearli all
the even offer hi fossil with great assidu to everi
passenger; but not one person bought ani

hallo! cri some sailor who had just row a boat to land bear a
hand here will you my littl fellow and carri these parcel for us
into yonder house?

jem ran down immedi for the parcel and did what he wa ask to do
so quickli and with so much good-wil that the master of the boat took
notic of him and when he wa go away stop to ask him what he
had got in hi littl basket; and when he saw that they were fossil he
immedi told jem to follow him for that he wa go to carri some
shell he had brought from abroad to a ladi in the neighbourhood who wa
make a grotto she will veri like buy your stone into the bargain
come along my lad; we can but tri

the ladi live but a veri littl way off so that they were soon at her
hous she wa alon in her parlour and wa sort a bundl of
feather of differ colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a
window seat and it happen that as the sailor wa bustl round the
tabl to show off hi shell he knock down the sheet of pasteboard
and scatter all the feather the ladi look veri sorri which jem
observ he took the opportun whilst she wa busi look over the
sailor bag of shell to gather togeth all the feather and sort

when he first came into the room

and here i am maam cri jem creep from under the tabl with
some few remain feather which he had pick from the carpet; i
thought ad he point to the other i had better be do

activ and simplic began to ask him sever questions; such as who
he wa where he live what employ he had and how much a day he
earn by gather fossil

thi is the first day i ever tri said jem; i never sold ani yet
and if you dont buy em now maam im afraid nobodi els will; for
ive ask everybodi els

had better buy them all so empti all the fossil out of hi
basket she put half a crown into it

jem eye sparkl with joy oh thank you maam said he i will

not that instead of encourag you to be industri would teach you
to be idl

jem did not quit understand what she meant by thi but answer im
sure i dont wish to be idle; what i want is to earn someth everi day
if i know how; im sure i dont wish to be idl if you knew all youd
know i did not

how do you mean if i knew all?

then said the ladi i will give you work come here to-morrow
morn and my garden will set you to weed the shrubberi and i will
pay you sixpenc a day rememb you must be at the gate by six

it wa late in the even and jem wa impati to get home to feed
lightfoot; yet he recollect that he had promis the man who had
trust him to sell the fossil that he would bring him half of what he
got for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and
away he went run along by the watersid about a quarter of a mile
till he came to the man hous he wa just come home from work and
wa surpris when jem show him the half-crown say look what i
got for the stones; you are to have half you know

the half of that is but sixpenc and that ill take wife give the lad
two shill and take thi half-crown so the wife open an old
glove and took out two shillings; and the man as she open the glove
put in hi finger and took out a littl silver penni there he shall

there a lucki penni for you that ive kept ever sinc i can rememb

the garden mark off a piec of the border with hi spade

then littl boy said the ladi so much shall be your task everi day
the garden will mark it off for you; and when youv done the rest of

jem wa extrem glad of this; and the next day he had finish hi task
by four oclock; so that he had all the rest of the even to himself
he wa as fond of play as ani littl boy could be; and when he wa at it
he play with all the eager and gaieti imaginable; so as soon as he

then what will you do with all your money?

oh i know veri well what to do with it; but as i told you that a
secret and i shant tell it anybodi come now let go back and play-
-their game up i daresay

lawrenc went back with him full of curios and out of humour with
himself and hi eightpenc if i had four and sevenp said he to
himself i certainli should be happy!

the next day as usual jem jump up befor six oclock and went to hi
work whilst lazi lawrenc saunter about without know what to do
with himself in the cours of two day he laid out sixpenc of hi
money in appl and gingerbread; and as long as these last he found
himself well receiv by hi companions; but at length the third day he
spent hi last halfpenni and when it wa gone unfortun some nut
tempt him veri much but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran
home to coax hi father as he call it

when he got home he heard hi father talk veri loud and at first he
thought he wa drunk; but when he open the kitchen door he saw that he
wa not drunk but angri

you lazi dog! cri he turn suddenli upon lawrenc and gave him
such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from hi eyes; you
lazi dog! see what youv done for me--look!--look look i say!

lawrenc look as soon as he came to the use of hi sens and with
fear amaz and remors beheld at least a dozen bottl burst and
the fine worcestershir cider stream over the floor

now did not i order you three day ago to carri these bottl to the
cellar and did not i charg you to wire the corks? answer me you lazi
rascal; did not i?

ye said lawrenc scratch hi head

and whi wa not it done i ask you? cri hi father with renew
anger as anoth bottl burst at the moment what do you stand there
for you lazi brat? whi dont you move i say? no no catch hold of
him i believ you cant move; but ill make you and he shook him
till lawrenc wa so giddi he could not stand what had you to think
of? what had you to do all day long that you could not carri my cider
my worcestershir cider to the cellar when i bid you? but go youll
never be good for anything; you are such a lazi rascal--get out of my
sight! so say he push him out of the hous door and lawrenc
sneak off see that thi wa no time to make hi petit for
halfpenc

the next day he saw the nut again and wish for them more than ever
he went home in hope that hi father as he said to himself would be
in a better humour but the cider wa still fresh in hi recollection;
and the moment lawrenc began to whisper the word halfpenni in hi ear
hi father swore with a loud oath i will not give you a halfpenni no
not a farth for a month to come if you want money go work for it;
ive had enough of your laziness--go work!

at these terribl word lawrenc burst into tear and go to the side
of a ditch sat down and cri for an hour; and when he had cri till he
could cri no more he exert himself so far as to empti hi pocket to
see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenni left; and to hi
great joy in the farthest corner of hi pocket one halfpenni wa found
with thi he proceed to the fruit woman stall she wa busi weigh
out some plum so he wa oblig to wait; and whilst he wa wait he
heard some peopl near him talk and laugh veri loud

the fruit woman stall wa at the gate of an inn yard; and peep
through the gate in thi yard lawrenc saw a postilion and a stabl boy
about hi own size play at pitch farth he stood by watch them
for a few minut i began but with one halfpenni cri the stabl
boy with an oath and now ive got twopence! ad he jingl the
halfpenc in hi waistcoat pocket lawrenc wa move at the sound and
said to himself if _i_ begin with one halfpenni i may end like him
with have twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farth than to
work

so he step forward present hi halfpenni offer to toss up with
the stabl boy who after look him full in the face accept the
propos and threw hi halfpenni into the air head or tail? cri
he head repli lawrenc and it came up head he seiz the penni
surpris at hi own success and would have gone instantli to have laid
it out in nuts; but the stabl boy stop him and tempt him to throw
again thi time lawrenc lost; he threw again and won; and so he went
on sometim lose but most frequent win till half the morn
wa lost at last howev find himself the master of three
halfpenc said he would play no more

the stabl boy grumbl swore he would have hi reveng anoth time
and lawrenc went and bought hi nut it is a good thing said he to
himself to play at pitch farthing; the next time i want a halfpenni
ill not ask my father for it nor go to work neither satisfi with
thi resolut he sat down to crack hi nut at hi leisur upon the
hors block in the inn yard here whilst he ate he overheard the
convers of the stabl boy and postilion at first their shock
oath and loud wrangl frighten and shock him; for lawrenc though
lazi had not yet learn to be a wick boy but by degre he wa
accustom to the swear and quarrel and took a delight and
interest in their disput and battl as thi wa an amus which
he could enjoy without ani sort of exert he soon grew so fond of it
that everi day he return to the stabl yard and the hors block becam
hi constant seat here he found some relief from the insupport
fatigu of do noth and here hour after hour with hi elbow on
hi knee and hi head on hi hand he sat the spectat of
wicked game cheat and lie soon becam familiar to him; and
to complet hi ruin he form a sudden and close intimaci with the
stabl boy (a veri bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game

the consequ of thi intimaci we shall present see but it is now
time to inquir what littl jem had been do all thi while

one day after jem had finish hi task the garden ask him to stay
a littl while to help him to carri some geranium pot into the hall
jem alway activ and oblig readili stay from play and wa
carri in a heavi flower pot when hi mistress cross the hall
what a terribl litter! said she you are make here--whi dont you
wipe your shoe upon the mat? jem turn to look for the mat but he
saw none oh said the ladi recollect herself i cant blame you
for there is no mat

no maam said the garden nor i dont know when if ever the man
will bring home those mat you bespok maam

i am veri sorri to hear that said the lady; i wish we could find
somebodi who would do them if he cant i should not care what sort of
mat they were so that one could wipe one feet on them

jem as he wa sweep away the litter when he heard these last word
said to himself perhap i could make a mat and all the way home as
he trudg along whistl he wa think over a scheme for make
mat which howev bold it may appear he did not despair of execut
with patienc and industri mani were the difficulti which hi
prophet eye foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which
spur men on to great enterpris and make them trampl on
imposs in the first place he recollect that he had seen
lazi lawrenc whilst he loung upon the gate twist a bit of heath into
differ shapes; and he thought that if he could find some way of
plait heath firmli togeth it would make a veri pretti green soft
mat which would do veri well for one to wipe one shoe on about a
mile from hi mother hous on the common which jem rode over when he
went to farmer truck for the giant strawberri he rememb to have
seen a great quantiti of thi heath; and as it wa now onli six oclock
in the even he knew that he should have time to feed lightfoot
stroke him go to the common return and make one trial of hi skill
befor he went to bed

lightfoot carri him swiftli to the common and there jem gather as
much of the heath as he thought he should want but what toil! what
time! what pain did it cost him befor he could make anyth like a
mat! twenti time he wa readi to throw asid the heath and give up hi
project from impati of repeat disappoint but still he
persev noth truli great can be accomplish without toil and
time two hour he work befor he went to bed all hi play hour the
next day he spent at hi mat; which in all made five hour of fruitless
attempt the sixth howev repaid him for the labour of the other
five he conquer hi grand difficulti of fasten the heath
substanti togeth and at length complet finish a mat which
far surpass hi most sanguin expect he wa extrem happy--
sang danc round it--whistled--look at it again and again and could
hardli leav off look at it when it wa time to go to bed he laid it
by hi bedsid that he might see it the moment he awok in the morn

and now came the grand pleasur of carri it to hi mistress she
look fulli as much surpris as he expect when she saw it and when
she heard who made it after have duli admir it she ask how much
he expect for hi mat expect!--noth maam said jem; i meant
to give it you if youd have it; i did not mean to sell it i made it
in my play hour i wa veri happi in make it; and im veri glad too
that you like it; and if you pleas to keep it maam that all

but that not all said the ladi spend your time no more in weed
in my garden you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the
reward of your ingenu as well as of your industri make as mani more
such mat as you can and i will take care and dispos of them for you

thank maam said jem make hi best bow for he thought by the
ladi look that she meant to do him a favour though he repeat to
himself dispos of them what doe that mean?

the next day he went to work to make more mat and he soon learn to
make them so well and quickli that he wa surpris at hi own success
in everi one he made he found less difficulti so that instead of make
two he could soon make four in a day in a fortnight he made eighteen

it wa saturday night when he finish and he carri at three
journey hi eighteen mat to hi mistress house; pile them all up in
the hall and stood with hi hat off with a look of proud humil
besid the pile wait for hi mistress appear present a
folding-door at one end of the hall open and he saw hi mistress
with a great mani gentlemen and ladi rise from sever tabl

oh! there is my littl boy and hi mat cri the lady; and follow
by all the rest of the compani she came into the hall jem modestli
retir whilst they look at hi mats; but in a minut or two hi
mistress beckon to him and when he came into the middl of the circl
he saw that hi pile of mat had disappear

well said the ladi smile what do you see that make you look so
surprised?

you see that it is get late and you know lightfoot will wonder
what becom of you jem turn round to take up hi hat which he had
left on the floor

but how hi counten changed! the hat wa heavi with shill
everyon who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the
eighteen mat he had got thirty-six shill thirty-six shill
said the lady; five and sevenp i think you told me you had earn
already--how much doe that make? i must add i believ one other
sixpenc to make out your two guinea

two guineas! exclaim jem now quit conquer hi bash for
at the moment he forgot where he wa and saw nobodi that wa by two
guineas! cri he clap hi hand together--o lightfoot! o
mother! then recollect himself he saw hi mistress whom he now
look up to quit as a friend will you thank them all? said he
scarc dare to glanc hi eye round upon the company; will you
thank em for you know i dont know how to thank em rightli
everybodi thought howev that they had been thank rightli

now we wont keep you ani longer onli said hi mistress i have one
thing to ask you that i may be by when you show your treasur to your
mother

not now said the ladi laughing; but i will come to ashton to-morrow
evening; perhap your mother can find me a few strawberri

that she will said jem: ill search the garden myself

he now went home but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow
even befor he told hi mother to consol himself he flew to the
stable:--lightfoot your not to be sold on monday poor fellow! said
he pat him and then could not refrain from count out hi money
whilst he wa intent upon thi jem wa startl by a nois at the door:
somebodi wa tri to pull up the latch it open and there came in
lazi lawrenc with a boy in a red jacket who had a cock under hi arm
they start when they got into the middl of the stabl and when they
saw jem who had been at first hidden by the hors

to ask you continu the stable-boy in a bold tone whether you will
go with us to the cock-fight on monday? see ive a fine cock here and
lawrenc told me you were a great friend of his; so i came

lawrenc now attempt to say someth in prais of the pleasur of
cock-fight and in recommend of hi new companion but jem look
at the stable-boy with dislik and a sort of dread then turn hi
eye upon the cock with a look of compass said in a low voic to
lawrenc shall you like to stand by and see it eye peck out?

i dont know said lawrenc as to that; but they say a cockfight a
fine sight and it no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great
mani go and ive noth els to do so i shall go

but i have someth els to do said jem laugh so i shall not
go

stabl boy

for all the world miss go to the fair for at least it will be
someth to talk of for half a year after come youll go wont you?

ill-look stranger

then what will you do with all your money?

ill tell you about that anoth time whisper jem; and dont you go
to see that cock eye peck out; it wont make you merri im sure

if i had anyth els to divert me said lawrenc hesit and
yawn

cri he; and pull him away from jem upon whom he cast a look of
extrem contempt; leav him alon he not the sort

what a fool you are said he to lawrenc the moment he got him out of
the stable; you might have known he would not go els we should soon
have trim him out of hi four and sevenp but how came you to
talk of four and sevenp i saw in the manger a hat full of silver

paid to-night so see and get the money somehow or other after a
consider paus he ad i answer for it hed never miss half a
crown out of all that silver

but it is not stealing; we dont mean to steal; onli to borrow it; and
if we win which we certainli shall at the cock-fight pay it back
again and hell never know anyth about the matter and what harm will
it do him? besid what signifi talk you cant go to the cock-
fight or the fair either if you dont; and i tell ye we dont mean to
steal it; well pay it by monday night

lawrenc made no repli and they part without hi come to ani
determin

here let us paus in our stori we are almost afraid to go on the rest
is veri shock our littl reader will shudder as they read but it
is better that they should know the truth and see what the idl boy came
to at last

in the dead of the night lawrenc heard somebodi tap at hi window he
knew well who it wa for thi wa the signal agre upon between him and
hi wick companion he trembl at the thought of what he wa about
to do and lay quit still with hi head under the bedcloth till he
heard the second tap then he got up dress himself and open hi
window it wa almost even with the ground hi companion said to him
in a hollow voic are you ready? he made no answer but got out of
the window and follow

when he got to the stabl a black cloud wa just pass over the moon
and it wa quit dark where are you? whisper lawrenc grope
about where are you? speak to me

i am here; give me your hand lawrenc stretch out hi hand is
that your hand? said the wick boy as lawrenc laid hold of him; how
cold it feel

money in it to the door the black cloud had now pass over the moon
and the light shone full upon them what do we stand here for? said
the stabl boy snatch the flower-pot out of lawrenc trembl
hand and pull him away from the door

good god! cri lawrenc you wont take all you said youd onli
take half a crown and pay it back on monday you said youd onli take
half a crown!

hold your tongu repli the other walk on deaf to all
remonstrances--if ever i am to be hang it shant be for half a
crown

lawrenc blood ran cold in hi vein and he felt as if all hi hair
stood on end not anoth word pass hi accomplic carri off the
money and lawrenc crept with all the horror of guilt upon him to hi
restless bed all night he wa start from fright dreams; or els
broad awak he lay listen to everi small nois unabl to stir and
scarc dare to breathe--tor by that most dread of all kind
of fear that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscienc

he thought the morn would never come; but when it wa day when he
heard the bird sing and saw everyth look cheer as usual he felt
still more miser it wa sunday morn and the bell rang for
church all the children of the villag dress in their sunday
cloth innoc and gay and littl jem the best and gayest amongst
them went flock by hi door to church

lawrenc lean against hi father door what make you look so
black?

nay then said jem you look white enough now if that will pleas
you for your turn as pale as death

pale? repli lawrenc not know what he said and turn abruptli
away for he dare not stand anoth look of jems; consciou that guilt
wa written in hi face he shun everi eye he would now have given
the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon hi mind
he long to follow jem to fall upon hi knee and confess all

dread the moment when jem should discov hi loss lawrenc dare not
stay at home and not know what to do or where to go he mechan
went to hi old haunt at the stabl yard and lurk thereabout all day
with hi accomplic who tri in vain to quiet hi fear and rais hi
spirit by talk of the next day cock-fight it wa agre that as
soon as the dusk of the even came on they should go togeth into a

not to give it to your mother to take care of?

whi dont you remember? said jem look up in the midst of hi
tears--whi dont you rememb you your own self bid me not tell her

ladi went on question him in a sever manner as if she did not
believ him he at last made no answer

oh jem! jem! whi dont you speak to the lady? said hi mother

i have spoke and spoke the truth said jem proudly; and she did not
believ me

suspicion maintain a cold manner and determin to wait the event
without interf say onli that she hope the money would be
found and advis jem to have done cri

should go to bridewel now than to the gallow by-and-bi

noth more wa said; for everybodi felt the truth of the farmer
speech

lawrenc wa eventu sent to bridewel for a month and the stable-boy
wa sent for trial convict and transport to botani bay

dure lawrenc confin jem often visit him and carri him
such littl present as he could afford to give; and jem could afford to
be gener becaus he wa industri lawrenc heart wa touch by
hi kind and hi exampl struck him so forcibl that when hi

the astonish of all who knew him soon becam remark for
industri he wa found earli and late at hi work establish a new
charact and for ever lost the name of lazi lawrenc



the fals key

mr spencer a veri benevol and sensibl man undertook the educ
of sever poor children among the rest wa a boy of the name of
franklin whom he had bred up from the time he wa five year old
franklin had the misfortun to be the son of a man of infam character;
and for mani year thi wa a disgrac and reproach to hi child when
ani of the neighbour children quarrel with him they use to tell
him that he would turn out like hi father but mr spencer alway
assur him that he might make himself whatev he pleased; that by
behav well he would certainli sooner or later secur the esteem and
love of all who knew him even of those who had the strongest prejudic
against him on hi father account

thi hope wa veri delight to franklin and he show the strongest
desir to learn and to do everyth that wa right; so that mr spencer
soon grew fond of him and took great pain to instruct him and to give
him all the good habit and principl which might make him a use
respect and happi man

when he wa about thirteen year of age mr spencer one day sent for him
into hi closet; and as he wa fold up a letter which he had been
write said to him with a veri kind look but in a graver tone than
usual franklin you are go to leav me

sir! said franklin

you are now go to leav me and to begin the world for yourself you
will carri thi letter to my sister mr churchil in queen squar
you know queen square? franklin bow you must expect continu
mr spencer to meet with sever disagre thing and a great deal
of rough work at your first set out; but be faith and obedi to
your mistress and oblig to your fellow-serv and all will go
well mr churchil will make you a veri good mistress if you behav
properly; and i have no doubt but you will

thank you sir

and you will always--i mean as long as you deserv it--find a friend in
me

thank you sir--i am sure you are-- there franklin stop short for
the recollect of all mr spencer good rush upon him at onc
and he could not say anoth word

bring me a candl to seal thi letter said hi master; and he wa veri
glad to get out of the room he came back with the candl and with a
stout heart stood by whilst the letter wa sealing; and when hi master
put it into hi hand said in a cheer voic i hope you will let me
see you again sir sometim

certainly; whenev your mistress can spare you i shall be veri glad to
see you; and rememb if ever you get into ani difficulti dont be
afraid to come to me i have sometim spoken harshli to you; but you
will not meet with a more indulg friend franklin at thi turn
away with a full heart; and after make two or three attempt to
express hi gratitud left the room without be abl to speak

he got to queen squar about three oclock the door wa open by a
larg red-fac man in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat to whom he
felt afraid to give hi messag lest he should not be a servant

well what your busi sir? said the butler

i have a letter for mr churchil sir said franklin endeavour to
pronounc hi sir in a tone as respect as the butler wa insol

the man have examin the direct seal and edg of the letter
carri it upstair and in a few minut return and order franklin
to rub hi shoe well and follow him he wa then shown into a handsom
room where he found hi mistress--an elderli ladi she ask him a few
question examin him attent as she spoke; and her sever eye at
first and her graciou smile afterward made him feel that she wa a
person to be both love and fear i shall give you in charg said
she ring a bell to my housekeep and i hope she will have no
reason to be displeas with you

the housekeep when she first came in appear with a smile
countenance; but the moment she cast her eye on franklin it chang to
a look of surpris and suspicion her mistress recommend him to her
protect say pomfret i hope you will keep thi boy under your
own eye and she receiv him with a cold veri well maam which
plainli show that she wa not dispos to like him in fact mr
pomfret wa a woman so fond of power and so jealou of favour that she
would have quarrel with an angel who had got so near her mistress
without her introduct she smother her displeasur howev till
night; when as she attend her mistress toilett she could not
refrain from express her sentiment she began cautiously: maam
is not thi the boy mr spencer wa talk of one day--that ha been
brought up by the villaintrop societi i think they call it?

philanthrop society; ye said her mistress; and my brother give
him a high character: i hope he will do veri well

im sure i hope so too observ mr pomfret; but i cant say; for my
part ive no great notion of those low peopl they say all those
children are taken from the veri lowest drug and refug of the town
and sure they are like enough maam to take after their own father
and mother

but they are not suffer to be with their parent rejoin the lady;
and therefor cannot be hurt by their exampl thi littl boy to be
sure wa unfortun in hi father but he ha had an excel
educ

oh edication! to be sure maam i know i dont say but what
edic is a great thing but then maam edic cant chang the
natur that in one they say; and one that born natur bad and low
they say all the edic in the world wont do no good; and for my
part maam i know you know best; but i should be afraid to let ani of
those villaintrop folk get into my house; for nobodi can tell the
natur of them aforehand i declar it fright me

pomfret i thought you had better sense: how would thi poor boy earn
hi bread? he would be forc to starv or steal if everybodi had such
prejudic

pomfret who realli wa a good woman wa soften at thi idea and
said god forbid he should starv or steal and god forbid i should say
anyth prejudiciari of the boy; for there may be no harm in him

well said mr churchil chang her tone but pomfret if we
dont like the boy at the end of the month we have done with him; for i
have onli promis mr spencer to keep him a month upon trial: there is
no harm done

dear no maam to be sure; and cook must put up with her
disappoint that all

what disappointment?

about her nephew maam; the boy she and i wa speak to you for

when?

the day you call her up about the almond pud maam if you
rememb you said you should have no object to tri the boy; and upon
that cook bought him new shirts; but they are to the good as i tell
her

but i did not promis to take her nephew

o no maam not at all; she doe not think to say that els i should
be veri angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word ani more than
fret that the boy should miss such a good place

well but sinc i did say that i should have no object to tri him i
shall keep my word; let him come to-morrow let them both have a fair
trial and at the end of the month i can decid which i like best and
which we had better keep

dismiss with these order mr pomfret hasten to report all that had
pass to the cook like a favourit minist proud to display the
extent of her secret influenc in the morn felix the cook nephew
arrived; and the moment he came into the kitchen everi eye even the
scullion wa fix upon him with approb and afterward glanc
upon franklin with contempt--contempt which franklin could not endur
without some confus though quit unconsci of have deserv it;
nor upon the most imparti and cool self-examin could he
comprehend the justic of hi judg he perceiv indeed--for the
comparison were minut made in audibl and scorn whispers--that
felix wa a much handsom or as the kitchen maid express it a much
more genteel gentlemanli look like sort of person than he was; and
he wa made to understand that he want a frill to hi shirt a cravat
a pair of thin shoe and abov all shoe string besid other
nameless advantag which justli made hi rival the admir of the
kitchen howev upon call to mind all that hi friend mr spencer
had ever said to him he could not recollect hi have warn him that
shoe string were indispens requisit to the charact of a good
servant; so that he could onli comfort himself with resolv if
possibl to make amend for these defici and to dissip the
prejudic which he saw were form against him by the strictest
adher to all that hi tutor had taught him to be hi duti he hope
to secur the approb of hi mistress by scrupul obedi to all
her command and faith care of all that belong to her at the same
time he flatter himself he should win the goodwil of hi fellow
servant by show a constant desir to oblig them he pursu thi
plan of conduct steadili for nearli three week and found that he
succeed beyond hi expect in pleas hi mistress; but
unfortun he found it more difficult to pleas hi fellow servant
and he sometim offend when he least expect it he had made great
progress in the affect of corkscrew the butler by work inde
veri hard for him and do everi day at least half hi busi but
one unfortun night the butler wa gone out; the bell rang: he went
upstairs; and hi mistress ask where corkscrew wa he answer that
he wa gone out where to! said hi mistress i dont know
answer franklin and as he had told exactli the truth and meant to
do no harm he wa surpris at the butler return when he repeat to
him what had pass at receiv a sudden box on the ear and the
appel of a mischiev impertin mean-spirit brat

mischiev impertin mean! repeat franklin to himself; but
look in the butler face which wa a deeper scarlet than usual he
judg that he wa far from sober and did not doubt but that the next
morn when he came to the use of hi reason he would be sensibl of
hi injustic and apolog for hi box of the ear but no apolog
come all day franklin at last ventur to request an explan or
rather to ask what he had best do on the next occas

whi said corkscrew when mistress ask for me how came you to say i
wa gone out?

becaus you know i saw you go out

and when she ask you where i wa gone how came you to say that you
did not know?

becaus inde i did not

you are a stupid blockhead! could you not say i wa gone to the
washerwomans?

but were you? said franklin

wa i? cri corkscrew and look as if he would have struck him
again; how dare you give me the lie mr hypocrite? you would be readi
enough ill be bound to make excus for yourself whi are not
mistress clog cleaned? go along and blacken em thi minut and send
felix to me

from thi time forward felix alon wa privileg to enter the butler
pantri felix becam the favourit of corkscrew; and though franklin by
no mean sought to pri into the mysteri of their privat confer
nor ever enter without knock at the door yet it wa hi fate onc
to be sent of a messag at an unlucki time; and as the door wa half
open he could not avoid see felix drink a bumper of red liquor
which he could not help suspect to be wine; and as the decant
which usual went upstair after dinner wa at thi time in the
butler grasp without ani stopper in it he wa involuntarili forc to
suspect they were drink hi mistress wine

nor were the bumper of port the onli unlaw reward which felix
received: hi aunt the cook had occas for hi assist and she
had mani delici douceur in her gift mani a hand of currant
mani a half-custard mani a triangular remnant of pie besid the choic
of hi own meal at breakfast dinner and supper fell to the share of the
favourit felix; whilst franklin wa neglect though he took the utmost
pain to pleas the cook in all honour servic and when she wa
hot angri or hurri he wa alway at hand to help her; and in the
hour of advers when the clock struck five and no dinner wa dish
and no kitchen maid with twenti pair of hand wa to be had franklin
would answer to her call with flower to garnish her dish and
presenc of mind to know in the midst of the commot where everyth
that wa want wa to be found; so that quick as lightn all
difficulti vanish befor him yet when the danger wa over and the
hour of advers had past the ungrat cook would forget her
benefactor and when it came to hi supper time would throw him with a
careless that touch him sensibl anyth which the other servant
were too nice to eat all thi franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he
envi felix the dainti which he ate sometim close besid him: for
said he to himself i have a clear conscienc and that is more than
felix can have i know how he win cook favour too well and i fanci i
know how i have offend her; for sinc the day i saw the basket she ha
done noth but huff me

the histori of the basket wa thi mr pomfret the housekeep had
sever time directli and indirectli given the world below to
understand that she and her mistress thought there wa a prodigi
quantiti of meat eaten of late now when she spoke it wa usual at
dinner time; she alway look or franklin imagin that she look
suspici at him other peopl look more maliciously; but as he
felt himself perfectli innoc he went on eat hi dinner in silenc

but at length it wa time to explain one sunday there appear a
handsom sirloin of beef which befor noon on monday had shrunk almost
to the bare bone and present such a deplor spectacl to the
open eye of mr pomfret that her long smother indign burst
forth and she boldli declar she wa now certain there had been foul
play and she would have the beef found or she would know whi she
spoke but no beef appear till franklin with a look of sudden
recollect cri did not i see someth like a piec of beef in a
basket in the dairy?--i think--

the cook as if somebodi had smote her a deadli blow grew pale; but
suddenli recov the use of her speech turn upon franklin and
with a voic of thunder gave him the lie direct; and forthwith take
mr pomfret by the ruffl led the way to the dairi declar she could
defi the world--that so she could and would there maam said she
kick an empti basket which lay on the floor--ther malic for you
ask him whi he dont show you the beef in the basket

i thought i saw-- poor franklin began

you thought you saw! cri the cook come close up to him with
kimbo arm and look like a dragon; and pray sir what busi
ha such a one as you to think you see? and pray maam will you be
pleas to speak--perhap maam hell condescend to obey you--maam
will you be pleas to forbid him my dairy? for here he come pri and
spi about; and how maam am i to answer for my butter and cream or
anyth at all? im sure it what i cant pretend to unless you do me
the justic to forbid him my place

mr pomfret whose eye were blind by her prejudic against the folk
of the villaintrop societi and also by her secret jealousi of a boy
whom she deem to be a grow favourit of her mistress took part
with the cook and end as she began with a firm persuas that
franklin wa the guilti person let him alon let him alone! said
she; he ha as mani turn and wind as a hare; but we shall catch him
yet ill be bound in some of hi doubl i knew the natur of him
well enough from the first time i ever set my eye upon him; but
mistress shall have her own way and see the end of it

these word and the bitter sens of injustic drew tear at length fast
down the proud cheek of franklin which might possibl have touch mr
pomfret if felix with a sneer had not call them crocodil tear
felix too! thought he; thi is too much in fact felix had till
now profess himself hi firm alli and had on hi part receiv from
franklin unequivoc proof of friendship; for it must be told that everi
other morn when it wa felix turn to get breakfast felix never wa
up in decent time and must inevit have come to public disgrac if
franklin had not got all the breakfast thing readi for him the bread
and butter spread and the toast toasted; and had not moreov
regularli when the clock struck eight and mr pomfret foot wa heard
overhead run to call the sleep felix and help him constantli
through the hurri of get dress one instant befor the housekeep
came downstair all thi could not but be present to hi memory; but
seem to reproach him franklin wipe away hi crocodil tear and
preserv a magnanim silenc

the hour of retribut wa howev not so far off as felix imagin
cun peopl may go on cleverli in their devic for some time; but
although they may escap onc twice perhap ninety-nin time what
doe that signify?--for the hundredth time they come to shame and lose
all their charact grown bold by frequent success felix becam more
careless in hi operations; and it happen that one day he met hi
mistress full in the passag as he wa go on one of the cook secret
errand

where are you go felix? said hi mistress

to the washerwoman maam answer he with hi usual effronteri

veri well said she call at the booksel in--stay i must write
down the direct pomfret said she open the housekeep room
door have you a bit of paper? pomfret came with the writing-pap
and look veri angri to see that felix wa go out without her
knowledge; so while mr churchil wa write the direct she stood
talk to him about it; whilst he in the greatest terror imagin
look up in her face as she spoke; but wa all the time intent on
parri on the other side the attack of a littl french dog of hi
mistress which unluckili for him had follow her into the passag
manchon wa extrem fond of felix who by way of pleas hi
mistress had paid most assidu court to her dog; yet now hi caress
were rather troublesom manchon leap up and wa not to be rebuf
poor fellow--poor fellow--down! down! poor fellow! cri felix and
put him away but manchon leap up again and began smell near the
fatal pocket in a most alarm manner you will see by thi direct
where you are to go said hi mistress manchon come here--and you
will be so good as to bring me--down! down! manchon be quiet! but
manchon knew better--h had now got hi head into felix pocket and
would not be quiet till he had drawn from thenc rustl out of it
brown paper half a cold turkey which had been miss sinc morn

my cold turkey as im alive! exclaim the housekeep dart upon
it with horror and amaz

what is all this? said mr churchil in a compos voic

i dont know maam answer felix so confus that he knew not what
to say; but--

but what? cri mr pomfret indign flash from her eye but
what? repeat hi mistress wait for hi repli with a calm air of
attent which still more disconcert felix; for though with an angri
person he might have some chanc of escap he knew that he could not
invent ani excus in such circumst which could stand the
examin of a person in her sober sens he wa struck dumb
speak said mr churchil in a still lower tone; i am readi to hear
all you have to say in my hous everybodi shall have justice; speak--
but what?

but stammer felix; and after in vain attempt to equivoc
confess that he wa go to take the turkey to hi cousins; but he
threw all the blame upon hi aunt the cook who he said had order
him upon thi expedit

the cook wa now summoned; but she total deni all knowledg of the
affair with the same violenc with which she had late confound
franklin about the beef in the basket; not entir howev with the
same success; for felix perceiv by hi mistress eye that she wa on
the point of desir him to leav the hous immediately; and not be
veri will to leav a place in which he had live so well with the
butler did not hesit to confront hi aunt with assur equal to her
own he knew how to bring hi charg home to her he produc a note in
her own handwrit the purport of which wa to request her cousin
accept of some delic cold turkey and to beg she would send her
by the return of the bearer a littl of her cherry-brandi

mr churchil coolli wrote upon the back of the note her cook
discharg and inform felix she had no further occas for hi
servic but upon hi plead with mani tear which franklin did not
call crocodil tear that he wa so young that he wa under the
dominion of hi aunt he touch mr pomfret compass and she
obtain for him permiss to stay till the end of the month to give
him yet a chanc of redeem hi charact

mr pomfret now see how far she had been impos upon resolv for
the futur to be more upon her guard with felix and felt that she had
treat franklin with great injustic when she accus him of
malpractic about the sirloin of beef

good peopl when they are made sensibl that they have treat anyon
with injustic are impati to have an opportun to rectifi their
mistake; and mr pomfret wa now prepar to see everyth which
franklin did in the most favour point of view; especi as the next
day she discov that it wa he who everi morn boil the water for
her tea and butter her toast--servic for which she had alway
thought she wa indebt to felix besid she had rate felix
abil veri highli becaus he made up her weekli account for her;
but unluckili onc when franklin wa out of the way and she brought a
bill in a hurri to her favourit to cast up she discov that he did
not know how to cast up pound shill and penc and he wa oblig
to confess that she must wait till franklin came home

but pass over a number of small incid which gradual unfold
the charact of the two boy we must proceed to a more seriou affair

corkscrew frequent after he had finish take away supper and after
the housekeep wa gone to bed salli forth to a neighbour alehous
to drink with hi friend the alehous wa kept by that cousin of
felix who wa so fond of delic cold turkey and who had such
choic cherry-brandi corkscrew kept the key of the hous door so that
he could return home whenev he thought proper; and if he should by
accid be call for by hi mistress after supper felix knew where to
find him and did not scrupl to make ani of those excus which poor
franklin had too much integr to use

all these precaut taken the butler wa at liberti to indulg hi
favourit passion which so increas with indulg that hi wage
were by no mean suffici to support him in thi way of life everi
day he felt less resolut to break through hi bad habits; for everi
day drink becam more necessari to him hi health wa ruin with
a red pimpl bloat face emaci leg and a swell diseas
bodi he appear the victim of intox in the morn when he
got up hi hand trembl hi spirit flag he could do noth
until he had taken a dram--an oper which he wa oblig to repeat
sever time in the cours of the day as all those wretch peopl must
who onc acquir thi habit

he had run up a long bill at the alehous which he frequented; and the
landlord who grew urgent for hi money refus to give further credit

one night when corkscrew had drunk enough onli to make him fret he
lean with hi elbow surlili upon the tabl began to quarrel with the
landlord and swore that he had not of late treat him like a gentleman
to which the landlord coolli repli that as long as he had paid like a
gentleman he had been treat like one and that wa as much as anyon
could expect or at ani rate as much as anyon would meet with in thi
world for the truth of thi assert he appeal laugh to a
parti of men who were drink in the room the men howev took part
with corkscrew and draw him over to their tabl made him sit down
with them they were in high good-humour and the butler soon grew so
intim with them that in the open of hi heart he soon
commun to them not onli all hi own affair but all that he knew
and more than all that he knew of hi mistress

hi new friend were by no mean uninterest by hi convers and
encourag him as much as possibl to talk; for they had secret view
which the butler wa by no mean suffici sober to discov

mr churchil had some fine old famili plate; and these men belong to
a gang of housebreak befor they part with corkscrew they engag
him to meet them again the next night; their intimaci wa still more
close cement one of the men actual offer to lend corkscrew
three guinea toward the payment of hi debt and hint that if he
thought proper he could easili get the whole clear off upon thi
hint corkscrew becam all attent till after some hesit on
their part and repeat promis of secreci on hi they at length
disclos their plan to him they gave him to understand that if he
would assist in let them into hi mistress hous they would let him
have an ampl share in the booti the butler who had the reput of
be an honest man and inde whose integr had hitherto been proof
against everyth but hi mistress port turn pale and trembl at
thi proposal; drank two or three bumper to drown thought; and promis
to give an answer the next day

he went home more than half-intox hi mind wa so full of what
had pass that he could not help brag to felix whom he found awak
at hi return that he could have hi bill paid off at the alehous
whenev he pleased; drop besid some hint which were not lost
upon felix

in the morn felix remind him of the thing which he had said; and
corkscrew alarm endeavour to evad hi question by say that he
wa not in hi sens when he talk in that manner noth howev
that he could urg made ani impress upon felix whose recollect on
the subject wa perfectli distinct and who had too much cun himself
and too littl confid in hi companion to be the dupe of hi
dissimul the butler knew not what to do when he saw that felix wa
absolut determin either to betray their scheme or to becom a
sharer in the booti

the next night came and he wa now to make a final decision; either to
determin on break off entir with hi new acquaint or take
felix with him to join in the plot

hi debt hi love of drink the imposs of indulg it without
a fresh suppli of money all came into hi mind at onc and conquer
hi remain scrupl it is said by those whose fatal experi give
them a right to be believ that a drunkard will sacrific anyth
everyth sooner than the pleasur of habitu intox

how much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through
it when onc formed!

the hour of rendezv came and corkscrew went to the alehous where he
found the housebreak wait for him and a glass of brandi readi
pour out he sighed--drank--hesitated--drank again--heard the landlord
talk of hi bill saw the money produc which would pay it in a moment--
drank again--curs himself and give hi hand to the villain who wa
whisper in hi ear swore that he could not help it and must do as
they would have him they requir of him to give up the key of the
hous door that they might get anoth made by it he had left it with
felix and wa now oblig to explain the new difficulti which had
arisen felix knew enough to ruin them and must therefor be won over
thi wa no veri difficult task; he had a strong desir to have some
work cravat and the butler knew enough of him to believ that thi
would be a suffici bribe the cravat were bought and shown to felix
he thought them the onli thing want to make him a complet fine
gentleman; and to go without them especi when he had onc seen
himself in the glass with one tie on in a splendid bow appear
imposs even thi paltri temptat work upon hi vaniti at
length prevail with a boy whose integr had long been corrupt by
the habit of petti pilfer and daili falsehood it wa agre that
the first time hi mistress sent him out on a messag he should carri
the key of the hous door to hi cousin and deliv it into the hand
of one of the gang who were there in wait for it such wa the
scheme

felix the night after all thi had been plan went to bed and fell
fast asleep; but the butler who had not yet stifl the voic of
conscienc felt in the silenc of the night so insupport
miser that instead of go to rest he stole softli into the
pantri for a bottl of hi mistress wine and there drink glass after
glass he stay till he becam so far intox that though he
contriv to find hi way back to bed he could by no mean undress
himself without ani power of recollect he flung himself upon the
bed leav hi candl half hang out of the candlestick besid him
franklin slept in the next room to him and present awak thought he
perceiv a strong smell of someth burn he jump up and see
a light under the butler door gentli open it and to hi
astonish beheld one of the bed curtain in flame he immedi
ran to the butler and pull him with all hi forc to rous him from
hi lethargi he came to hi sens at length but wa so terrifi and
so helpless that if it had not been for franklin the whole hous would
soon inevit have been on fire felix trembl and cowardli knew
not what to do; and it wa curiou to see him obey franklin whose
turn it now wa to command franklin ran upstair to awaken mr
pomfret whose terror of fire wa so great that she came from her room
almost out of her sens whilst he with the greatest presenc of mind
recollect where he had seen two larg tub of water which the maid
had prepar the night befor for their wash and seiz the wet
linen which had been left to soak he threw them upon the flame he
exert himself with so much good sens that the fire wa present
extinguish

everyth wa now onc more safe and quiet mr pomfret recov
from her fright postpon all inquiri till the morn and rejoic
that her mistress had not been awaken whilst corkscrew flatter
himself that he should be abl to conceal the true caus of the accid

dont you tell mr pomfret where you found the candl when you came
into the room said he to franklin

if she ask me you know i must tell the truth repli he

must! repeat felix sneeringly; what you must be a tell-tale!

no i never told ani tale of anybodi and i should be veri sorri to get
anyon into a scrape; but for all that i shall not tell a lie either for
myself or anybodi els let you call me what name you will

but if i were to give you someth that you would like said
corkscrew--someth that i know you would like! repeat felix

noth you can give me will do answer franklin steadili so it is
useless to say ani more about it--i hope i shall not be question

in thi hope he wa mistaken; for the first thing mr pomfret did in the
morn wa to come into the room to examin and deplor the burnt
curtain whilst corkscrew stood by endeavour to exculp himself by
all the excus he could invent

mr pomfret howev though sometim blind by her prejudic wa no
fool; and it wa absolut imposs to make her believ that a candl
which had been left on the hearth where corkscrew protest he had left
it could have set curtain on fire which were at least six feet distant
turn short round to franklin she desir that he would show her where
he found the candl when he came into the room he took up the
candlestick; but the moment the housekeep cast her eye upon it she
snatch it from hi hands; how did thi candlestick come here? thi
wa not the candlestick you found here last night cri she ye
inde it wa answer franklin that is imposs retort she

butler wa gone to bed--im sure of it--nay dont you recollect my

up to bed with the brass one and i bolt the door at the stair-head

thi wa all veri true; but corkscrew had afterward gone down from hi
room by a back staircas unbolt that door and upon hi return from
the alehous had taken the japan candlestick by mistak upstair and
had left the brass one in it stead upon the hall tabl

oh maam said felix inde you forget; for mr corkscrew came into
my room to desir me to call him betim in the morn and i happen
to take particular notic and he had the japan candlestick in hi
hand and that wa just as i heard you bolt the door inde maam

inde sir retort mr pomfret rise in anger i do not forget;
im not come to be supperannu yet i hope how do you dare to tell
me i forget?

oh maam cri felix i beg your pardon i did not--i did not mean
to say you forgot but onli i thought perhap you might not
particularli remember; for if you pleas to recollect--

i wont pleas to recollect just whatev you pleas sir! hold your
tongue; whi should you poke yourself into thi scrape; what have you to
do with it i should be glad to know?

noth in the world oh noth in the world; im sure i beg your
pardon maam answer felix in a soft tone; and sneak off left
hi friend corkscrew to fight hi own battl secretli resolv to
desert in good time if he saw ani danger of the alehous transact
come to light

corkscrew could make but veri blunder excus for himself and
consciou of guilt he turn pale and appear so much more terrifi
than butler usual appear when detect in a lie that mr pomfret
resolv as she said to sift the matter to the bottom impati did
she wait till the clock struck nine and her mistress bell rang the
signal for her attend at her leve

how do you find yourself thi morn maam? said she undraw the
curtain

veri sleepi inde answer her mistress in a drowsi voice; i think
i must sleep half an hour longer--shut the curtain

as you pleas maam; but i suppos i had better open a littl of the
window shutter for it past nine

but just struck

oh dear maam it struck befor i came upstair and you know we are
twenti minut slow--lord bless us! exclaim mr pomfret as she let
fall the bar of the window which rous her mistress im sure i beg
your pardon a thousand times--it onli the bar--becaus i had thi great
key in my hand

put down the key then or youll knock someth els down; and you may
open the shutter now; for im quit awak

dear me! im so sorri to think of disturb you cri mr pomfret
at the same time throw the shutter wide open; but to be sure
maam i have someth to tell you which wont let you sleep again in a
hurri i brought up thi here key of the hous door for reason of my
own which im sure youll approv of; but im not come to that part of
my stori yet i hope you were not disturb by the nois in the hous
last night maam

i heard no nois

i am surpris at that though continu mr pomfret and proceed
to give a most ampl account of the fire of her fear and her
suspicion to be sure maam what i say is that without the spirit
of propheci one can nowaday account for what ha pass im quit
clear in my own judgment that mr corkscrew must have been out last
night after i went to bed; for besid the japan candlestick which
of itself im sure is strong enough to hang a man there anoth
circumst maam that certifi it to me--though i have not mention
it maam to no one yet lower her voice--franklin when i
question him told me that he left the lantern in the outsid porch in
the court last night and thi morn it wa on the kitchen tabl now
maam that lantern could not come without hands; and i could not forget
about that you know; for franklin say he sure he left the lantern
out

and do you believ him? inquir her mistress

to be sure maam--how can i help believ him? i never found him out
in the least symptom of a lie sinc ever he came into the house; so one
cant help believ in him like him or not

without mean to tell a falsehood howev said the ladi he might
make a mistak

no maam he never make mistakes; it is not hi way to go gossip
and tattling; he never tell anyth till he ask and then it fit
he should about the sirloin of beef and all he wa right in the end
i found to do him justice; and im sure he right now about the
lantern--h alway right

mr churchil could not help smile

if you had seen him maam last night in the midst of the fire--im
sure we may thank him that we were not burn aliv in our beds--and i
shall never forget hi come to call me poor fellow! he that i wa
alway scold and scold enough to make him hate me but he too
good to hate anybody; and ill be bound ill make it up to him now

take care that you dont go from one extrem into anoth pomfret;
dont spoil the boy

no maam there no danger of that; but im sure if you had seen him
last night yourself you would think he deserv to be reward

and so he shall be reward said mr churchill; but i will tri him
more fulli yet

there no occas i think for tri him ani more maam said mr
pomfret who wa as violent in her like as in her dislik

pray desir continu her mistress that he will bring up breakfast
thi morning; and leav the key of the house-door pomfret with me

when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour hi mistress
wa stand by the fire with the key in her hand she spoke to him of
hi last night exert in term of much approb how long have
you live with me? said she pausing; three week i think?

three week and four day madam

that is but a short time; yet you have conduct yourself so as to make
me think i may depend upon you you know thi key?

i believ madam it is the key of the house-door

it is; i shall trust it in your care it is a great trust for so young
a person as you are franklin stood silent with a firm but modest
look if you take the charg of thi key continu hi mistress
rememb it is upon condit that you never give it out of your own
hand in the daytim it must not be left in the door you must not
tell anybodi where you keep it at night; and the house-door must not be
unlock after eleven oclock at night unless by my order will you
take charg of the key upon these conditions?

i will madam do anyth you order me said franklin and receiv
the key from her hand

when mr churchil order were made known they caus mani secret
marvel and murmur corkscrew and felix were disconcert and
dare not openli avow their discontent; and they treat franklin with
the greatest seem kind and cordial

everyth went on smoothli for three day the butler never attempt
hi usual midnight visit to the alehous but went to bed in proper
time and paid particular court to mr pomfret in order to dispel her
suspicion she had never had ani idea of the real fact that he and
felix were join in a plot with house-break to rob the hous but
thought he onli went out at irregular hour to indulg himself in hi
passion for drink

thu stood affair the night befor mr churchil birthday
corkscrew by the housekeep mean ventur to present a petit
that he might go to the play the next day and hi request wa grant
franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servant had gather
round the butler who with great import wa read aloud the play-
bill everybodi present soon began to speak at onc and with great
enthusiasm talk of the playhous the actor and actresses; and then
felix in the first paus turn to franklin and said lord you know
noth of all this! you never went to a play did you?

never said franklin and felt he did not know whi a littl ashamed;
and he long extrem to go to one

how should you like to go to the play with me to-morrow? said
corkscrew

oh exclaim franklin i should like it exceedingli

and do you think mistress would let you if i asked?

i think mayb she would if mr pomfret ask her

but then you have no money have you?

no said franklin sigh

but stay said corkscrew what i am think of is that if mistress
will let you go ill treat you myself rather than that you should he
disappoint

delight surpris and gratitud appear in franklin face at these
word corkscrew rejoic to see that now at least he had found a most
power temptat well then ill go just now and ask her in the
meantim lend me the key of the hous door for a minut or two

the key! answer franklin starting; im sorri but i cant do that
for ive promis my mistress never to let it out of my own hand

but how will she know anyth of the matter? run run and get it for
us

no i cannot repli franklin resist the push which the butler
gave hi shoulder

you cant? cri corkscrew chang hi tone; then sir i cant take
you to the play

veri well sir said franklin sorrow but with steadi

veri well sir said felix mimick him you need not look so
import nor fanci yourself such a great man becaus your master of
a key

say no more to him interrupt corkscrew: let him alon to take hi
own way felix you would have no object i suppos to go to the
play with me?

oh i should like it of all thing if i did not come between anybodi
els but come come! ad the hypocrit assum a tone of friendli
persuas you wont be such a blockhead franklin as to lose go to
the play for nothing; it onli just obstinaci what harm can it do to
lend mr corkscrew the key for five minutes? hell give it to you back
again safe and sound

i dont doubt that answer franklin

then it must be all becaus you dont wish to oblig mr corkscrew

no but i cant oblig him in this; for as i told you befor my
mistress trust me i promis never to let the key out of my own
hand and you would not have me break my trust mr spencer told me
that wa wors than rob

at the word rob both corkscrew and felix involuntarili cast down
their eye and turn the convers immedi say that he did
veri right; that they did not realli want the key and had onli ask for
it just to tri if he would keep hi word shake hand said corkscrew
i am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow!

i am sorri you did not think me an honest fellow befor mr corkscrew
said franklin give hi hand rather proudli and he walk away

we shall make no hand of thi prig said corkscrew

but well have the key from him in spite of all hi obstinaci said
felix; and let him make hi stori good as he can afterward he shall
repent of these air to-night ill watch him and find out where he
hide the key; and when he asleep well get it without thank him

thi plan felix put into execut they discov the place where
franklin kept the key at night stole it whilst he slept took off the
impress in wax and care replac it in franklin trunk exactli
where they found it

probabl our young reader cannot guess what use they could mean to make
of thi impress of the key in wax know how to do mischief is veri
differ from wish to do it: and the most innoc person are
gener the least ignor by mean of the impress which they had
thu obtain corkscrew and felix propos to get a fals key made by
picklock a smith who belong to their gang of house-breakers; and with
thi fals key knew they could open the door whenev they pleas

littl suspect what had happen franklin the next morn went to
unlock the hous door as usual; but find the key entangl in the
lock he took it out to examin it and perceiv a lump of wax stick
in one of the ward struck with thi circumst it brought to hi
mind all that had pass the preced even and be sure that he
had no wax near the key he began to suspect what had happened; and he
could not help recollect what he had onc heard felix say that give
him but a halfpenni worth of wax and he could open the strongest lock
that ever wa made by hand

all these thing consid franklin resolv to take the key just as it
wa with the wax stick to it to hi mistress

i wa not mistaken when i thought i might trust you with thi key said
mr churchil after she had heard hi stori my brother will be here
to-day and i shall consult him in the meantim say noth of what
ha pass

even came and after tea mr spencer sent for franklin upstair so
mr franklin said he im glad to find you are in such high trust in
thi famili franklin bow but you have lost i understand the
pleasur of go to the play to-night

i dont think anything--much i mean of that sir answer franklin
smile

are corkscrew and felix gone to the play?

yes; half an hour ago sir

then i shall look into hi room and examin the pantri and the plate
that is under hi care

when mr spencer came to examin the pantri he found the larg salver
and cup in a basket behind the door and the other thing place so as
to be easili carri off noth at first appear in corkscrew
bedchamb to strengthen their suspicion till just as they were go
to leav the room mr pomfret exclaim whi if there is not mr
corkscrew dress coat hang up there! and if here isnt felix fine
cravat that he want in such a hurri to go to the play! whi sir they
cant be gone to the play look at the cravat ah! upon my word i am
afraid they are not at the play no sir you may be sure that they are
plot with their barbar gang at the alehouse; and theyll certainli
break into the hous to-night we shall all be murder in our bed as
sure as im a live woman sir; but if youll onli take my advice--

pray good mr pomfret mr spencer observ dont be alarm

nay sir but i wont pretend to sleep in the hous if franklin isnt
to have a blunderbuss and i a baggonet

you shall have both inde mr pomfret; but dont make such a nois
for everybodi will hear you

the love of mysteri wa the onli thing which could have conquer mr
pomfret love of talk she wa silent and content herself the
rest of the even with make sign look omin and stalk
about the hous like one possess with a secret

escap from mr pomfret fear and advic mr spencer went to a shop
within a few door of the alehous which he heard corkscrew frequent
and sent to beg to speak to the landlord he came; and when mr spencer
question him confess that corkscrew and felix were actual drink
in hi hous with two men of suspici appearance; that as he pass
through the passag he heard them disput about a key; and that one of
them said sinc weve got the key well go about it to-night thi
wa suffici inform mr spencer lest the landlord should give
them inform of what wa go forward took him along with him to
bow street

a constabl and proper assist wa sent to mr churchil they
station themselv in a back parlour which open on a passag lead
to the butler pantri where the plate wa kept a littl after
midnight they heard the hall door open corkscrew and hi accomplic
went directli to the pantry; and there mr spencer and the constabl
immedi secur them as they were carri off their booti

mr churchil and pomfret had spent the night at the hous of an
acquaint in the same street well maam said mr pomfret who
had heard all the news in the morn the villain are all safe thank
god i wa afraid to go to the window thi morning; but it wa my luck
to see them all go by to gaol they look so shocking! i am sure i
never shall forget felix look to my die day! but poor franklin!
maam; that boy ha the best heart in the world i could not get him to
give a second look at them as they pass poor fellow! i thought he
would have dropped; and he wa so modest maam when mr spencer spoke
to him and told him he had done hi duti

and did my brother tell him what reward i intend for him?

no maam and im sure franklin think no more of reward than i do

i intend continu mr churchil to sell some of my old useless
plate and to lay it out in an annuiti for franklin life

mistaken at the first in ani boy in my born days; but he ha won me by
hi own desert and i shall from thi time forth love all the

chapter i

wake as her custom wa befor the day
to do the observ due to sprightli may
dryden

in a retir hamlet on the border of wale between oswestri and
shrewsburi it is still the custom to celebr the 1st of may

the children of the villag who look forward to thi rural festiv with
joy eager usual meet on the last day of april to make up their
nosegay for the morn and to choos their queen their customari
place of meet is at a hawthorn which stand in a littl green nook
open on one side to a shadi lane and separ on the other side by a
thick sweet-brier and hawthorn hedg from the garden of an attorney

thi attorney began the world with noth but he contriv to scrape
togeth a good deal of money everybodi knew how he built a new hous
at the entranc of the villag and had a larg well fenc garden yet
notwithstand hi fenc he never felt himself secur such were hi

villag children of give offenc to thi irrit man of the law that
they would not ventur to fli a kite near hi field lest it should

mr case for thi wa the name of our attorney had a son and a
daughter to whose educ he had not time to attend as hi whole soul
wa intent upon accumul for them a fortun for sever year he
suffer hi children to run wild in the village; but suddenli on hi
be appoint to a consider agenc he began to think of make hi
children a littl genteel he sent hi son to learn latin; he hire a
maid to wait upon hi daughter barbara; and he strictli forbad her
thenceforward to keep compani with ani of the poor children who had
hitherto been her playfellow they were not sorri for thi prohibit
becaus she had been their tyrant rather than their companion she wa
vex to observ that her absenc wa not regret and she wa
mortifi to perceiv that she could not humbl them by ani display of
air and fineri

there wa one poor girl amongst her former associ to whom she had a
peculiar dislike--susan price a sweet temper modest sprightli
industri lass who wa the pride and delight of the villag her
father rent a small farm and unfortun for him he live near
attorney case

barbara use often to sit at her window watch susan at work
sometim she saw her in the neat garden rake the bed or weed the
borders; sometim she wa kneel at her beehiv with fresh flower for
her bees; sometim she wa in the poultri yard scatter corn from her
siev amongst the eager chickens; and in the even she wa often seat
in a littl honeysuckl arbour with a clean light three-leg deal
tabl befor her upon which she put her plain work

susan had been taught to work neatli by her good mother who wa veri
fond of her and to whom she wa most grate attach

mr price wa an intellig activ domest woman; but her health wa
not robust she earn money howev by take in plain work; and she
wa famou for bake excel bread and breakfast cake she wa
respect in the villag for her conduct as a wife and as a mother and
all were eager to show her attent at her door the first branch of
hawthorn wa alway place on may morn and her susan wa usual
queen of the may

it wa now time to choos the queen the set sun shone full upon the
pink blossom of the hawthorn when the merri group assembl upon their
littl green barbara wa now walk in sullen state in her father
garden she heard the busi voic in the lane and she conceal herself
behind the high hedg that she might listen to their convers

where susan? were the first unwelcom word which she overheard
ay where susan? repeat philip stop short in the middl of a
new tune that he wa play on hi pipe i wish susan would come! i
want her to sing me thi same tune over again; i have not it yet

and i wish susan would come im sure cri a littl girl whose lap
wa full of primros susan will give me some thread to tie up my
nosegay and shell show me where the fresh violet grow; and she ha
promis to give me a great bunch of her doubl cowslip to wear to-
morrow i wish she would come

noth can be done without susan! she alway show us where the nicest
flower are to be found in the lane and meadow said they she must
make up the garlands; and she shall be queen of the may! exclaim a
multitud of littl voic

but she doe not come! said philip

rose who wa her particular friend now came forward to assur the
impati assembl that she would answer for it susan would come as
soon as she possibl could and that she probabl wa detain by
busi at home

the littl elector thought that all busi should give way to their

tell her to make hast cri philip attorney case dine at the
abbey to-day--luckili for us if he come home and find us here mayb
hell drive us away; for he say thi bit of ground belong to hi
garden: though that is not true im sure; for farmer price know and
say it wa alway open to the road the attorney want to get our
playground so he doe i wish he and hi daughter bab or miss barbara
as she must now be call were a hundr mile off out of our way i
know no later than yesterday she threw down my nine-pin in one of her
ill-humour as she wa walk by with her gown all trail in the
dust

trail she doe not hold it up nice like susan; and with all her
fine cloth she never look half so neat mamma say she wish i may
be like susan when i grow up to be a great girl and so do i i should
not like to look conceit as barbara doe if i wa ever so rich

rich or poor said philip it doe not becom a girl to look
conceit much less bold as barbara did the other day when she wa at
her father door without a hat upon her head stare at the strang
gentleman who stop hereabout to let hi hors drink i know what he
thought of bab by hi look and of susan too; for susan wa in her
garden bend down a branch of the laburnum-tre look at it yellow
flower which were just come out; and when the gentleman ask her how
mani mile it wa from shrewsburi she answer him so modest!--not
bash like as if she had never seen nobodi before--but just right; and
then she pull on her straw hat which wa fallen back with her look
up at the laburnum and she went her way home; and the gentleman say to
me after she wa gone pray who is that neat modest girl--? but i
wish susan would come cri philip interrupt himself

susan wa all thi time as her friend rose rightli guess busi at
home she wa detain by her father return later than usual hi
supper wa readi for him nearli an hour befor he came home; and susan
swept up the ash twice and twice put on wood to make a cheer blaze
for him; but at last when he did come in he took no notic of the blaze
or of susan; and when hi wife ask him how he did he made no answer
but stood with hi back to the fire look veri gloomi susan put hi
supper upon the tabl and set hi own chair for him; but he push away
the chair and turn from the tabl saying--i shall eat noth child!

ha such a daughter as susan!--h unalt sweet of temper and her
play affection caress at last somewhat dissip her father

he could not be prevail upon to eat ani of the supper which had been
prepar for him; howev with a faint smile he told susan that he
thought he could eat one of her guinea-hen egg she thank him and
with that nimbl alacr which mark the desir to pleas she ran to
her neat chicken-yard; but alas! her guinea-hen wa not there--it had
stray into the attorney garden she saw it through the pale and

hear what he wa go to say retir from behind hi chair susan
dont go; sit you down here my sweet susan said he make room for
her upon hi chair; i believ i wa a littl cross when i came in first
tonight; but i had someth to vex me as you shall hear

about a fortnight ago you know wife continu he there wa a
ballot in our town for the militia; now at that time i want but ten
day of forti year of age; and the attorney told me i wa a fool for not
call myself plump forti but the truth is the truth and it is what i
think fittest to be spoken at all time come what will of it so i wa
drawn for a militiaman; but when i thought how loth you and i would be to
part i wa main glad to hear that i could get off by pay eight or
nine guinea for a substitute--onli i had not the nine guineas--for you
know we had bad luck with our sheep thi year and they die away one
after another--but that wa no excus so i went to attorney case and
with a power of difficulti i got him to lend me the money; for which to
be sure i gave him someth and left my leas of our farm with him as
he insist upon it by way of secur for the loan attorney case is
too mani for me he ha found what he call a flaw in my lease; and the
leas he tell me is not worth a farth and that he can turn us all
out of our farm to-morrow if he pleases; and sure enough he will pleas
for i have thwart him thi day and he swear hell be reveng of me
inde he ha begun with me badli enough alreadi im not come to the
worst part of my stori yet--

here farmer price made a dead stop; and hi wife and susan look up in
hi face breathless with anxieti

it must come out said he with a short sigh; i must leav you in
three day wife

must you? said hi wife in a faint resign voic susan love
open the window susan ran to open the window and then return to
support her mother head when she came a littl to herself she sat up
beg that her husband would go on and that noth might be conceal
from her her husband had no wish inde to conceal anyth from a wife
he love so well; but firm as he wa and steadi to hi maxim that the
truth wa the thing the fittest to be spoken at all time hi voic
falter and it wa with great difficulti that he brought himself to
speak the whole truth at thi moment

the fact wa thi case met farmer price as he wa come home
whistl from a new plough field the attorney had just dine at the
abbey the abbey wa the famili seat of an opul baronet in the
neighbourhood to whom mr case had been agent the baronet die
suddenli and hi estat and titl devolv to a younger brother who wa
now just arriv in the countri and to whom mr case wa eager to pay
hi court in hope of obtain hi favour of the agenc he flatter
himself that he wa pretti secure; and he thought that he might assum
the tone of command toward the tenant especi toward one who wa
some guinea in debt and in whose leas there wa a flaw

accost the farmer in a haughti manner the attorney began with so
farmer price a word with you if you pleas walk on here man besid
my hors and youll hear me you have chang your opinion i hope
about that bit of land--that corner at the end of my garden?

as how mr case? said the farmer

as how man! whi you said someth about it not belong to me
when you heard me talk of inclos it the other day

so i did said price and so i do

provok and astonish at the firm tone in which these word were
pronounc the attorney wa upon the point of swear that he would
have hi revenge; but as hi passion were habitu attent to the
letter of the law he refrain from ani hasti express which might
he wa awar in a court of justic be hereaft brought against him

my good friend mr price said he in a soft voic and pale with
suppress rage he forc a smile im under the necess of call

no said the farmer not a guinea of it; but john simpson who wa my
substitut ha not left our villag yet ill get the money back from
him and go myself if so be it must be so into the militia--so i will

the attorney did not expect such a determin and he repres in
a friendli hypocrit tone to price that he had no wish to drive him
to such an extremity; that it would be the height of folli in him to run
hi head against a wall for no purpos you dont mean to take the
corner into your own garden do you price? said he

i? said the farmer god forbid! it none of mine i never take what
doe not belong to me

true right veri proper of cours said mr case; but then you have
no interest in life in the land in question?

none

then whi so stiff about it price? all i want of you to say--

to say that black is white which i wont do mr case the ground is a
thing not worth talk of; but it neither your nor mine in my
memori sinc the new lane wa made it ha alway been open to the
parish; and no man shall inclos it with my good-wil truth is truth
and must be spoken; justic is justic and should be done mr
attorney

and law is law mr farmer and shall have it cours to your cost
cri the attorney exasper by the dauntless spirit of thi villag
hampden

here they part the glow of enthusiasm the pride of virtu which
made our hero brave could not render him insens as he drew nearer
home mani melancholi thought press upon hi heart he pass the
door of hi own cottag with resolut step howev and went through
the villag in search of the man who had engag to be hi substitut
he found him told him how the matter stood; and luckili the man who had
not yet spent the money wa will to return it; as there were mani
other drawn for the militia who he observ would be glad to give him
the same price or more for hi servic

the moment price got the money he hasten to mr case hous walk
straight forward into hi room and lay the money down upon hi desk
there mr attorney are your nine guineas; count them; now i have done

for vexat

when susan heard her father stori she quit forgot her guinea-hen and
her whole soul wa intent upon her poor mother who notwithstand her
utmost exert could not support herself under thi sudden stroke of
misfortun

in the middl of the night susan wa call up; her mother fever ran
high for some hours; but toward morn it abat and she fell into a
soft sleep with susan hand lock fast in her

susan sat motionless and breath softli lest she should disturb her
the rushlight which stood besid the bed wa now burnt low; the long
shadow of the tall wicker chair flit fade appear and vanish
as the flame rose and sunk in the socket susan wa afraid that the
disagre smell might waken her mother; and gentli disengag her
hand she went on tipto to extinguish the candl all wa silent: the
grey light of the morn wa now spread over everi object; the sun
rose slowli and susan stood at the lattic window look through the
small lead cross-bar pane at the splendid spectacl a few bird
began to chirp; but as susan wa listen to them her mother start
in her sleep and spoke unintellig susan hung up a white apron
befor the window to keep out the light and just then she heard the
sound of music at a distanc in the villag as it approach nearer
she knew that it wa philip play upon hi pipe and tabor she
distinguish the merri voic of her companion carol in honour of
the may and soon she saw them come toward her father cottag with
branch and garland in their hand she open quick but gentli the
latch of the door and ran out to meet them

here she is!--her susan! they exclaim joy here the
queen of the may and here her crown! cri rose press forward;
but susan put her finger upon her lip and point to her mother
window philip pipe stop instantli

then gentli put asid the crown her companion bid her say who
should wear it for her

into the village; so you need onli stop till then philip

i shall stop for all day said philip: ive no mind to play ani

pretti they are and smell how sweet the violet are in my bosom and
kiss me quick for i shall be left behind susan kiss the littl
breathless girl and return softli to the side of her mother bed

how grate that child is to me for a cowslip only! how can i be
grate enough to such a mother as this? said susan to herself as she
bent over her sleep mother pale counten

her mother unfinish knit lay upon a tabl near the bed and susan
sat down in her wicker arm-chair and went on with the row in the middl
of which her hand stop the preced even she taught me to knit
she taught me everyth that i know thought susan and the best of
all she taught me to love her to wish to be like her

her mother when she awaken felt much refresh by her tranquil sleep
and observ that it wa a delight morn said that she had been
dream she heard music; but that the drum frighten her becaus she
thought it wa the signal for her husband to be carri away by a whole
regiment of soldier who had point their bayonet at him but that
wa but a dream susan; i awok and knew it wa a dream and i then fell
asleep and have slept soundli ever sinc

how pain it is to awak to the remembr of misfortun gradual
as thi poor woman collect her scatter thought she recal the
circumst of the preced even she wa too certain that she had
heard from her husband own lip the word i must leav you in three
days; and she wish that she could sleep again and think it all a
dream

but hell want hell want a hundr thing said she start up i
must get hi linen readi for him im afraid it veri late susan whi

everyth shall be readi dear mother; onli dont hurri yourself said
susan and inde her mother wa ill abl to bear ani hurri or to do
ani work thi day susan affection dexter sensibl activ
wa never more want or more effectu she understood so readili she
obey so exactly; and when she wa left to her own discret judg so
prudent that her mother had littl troubl and no anxieti in direct
her she said that susan never did too littl or too much

susan wa mend her father linen when rose tap softli at the
window and beckon to her to come out she went out how doe your
mother do in the first place? said rose

that well and i have a littl bit of good news for you besides--
here said she pull out a glove in which there wa money well
get the guinea-hen back again--w have all agre about it thi is the
money that ha been given to us in the villag thi may morn at
everi door they gave silver see how gener they have been--twelv
shill i assur you now we are a match for miss barbara you wont
like to leav home; ill go to barbara and you shall see your guinea-hen
in ten minut

rose hurri away pleas with her commiss and to accomplish her
busi miss barbara maid betti wa the first person that wa
visibl at the attorney hous rose insist upon see miss barbara
herself and she wa shown into a parlour to the young ladi who wa
read a dirti novel which she put under a heap of law paper as they
enter

dear how you startl me! is it onli you? said she to her maid; but
as soon as she saw rose behind the maid she put on a scorn air
could not ye say i wa not at home betty? well my good girl what
bring you here? someth to borrow or beg i suppos

may everi ambassador--everi ambassador in as good a cause--answ with as
much digniti and moder as rose repli to barbara upon the present
occas she assur her that the person from whom she came did not
send her either to beg or borrow; that she wa abl to pay the full valu
of that for which she came to ask; and produc her well fill purs
i believ that thi is a veri good shill said she if you dont
like it i will chang it and now you will be so good as to give me
susan guinea-hen it is in her name i ask for it

no matter in whose name you ask for it repli barbara you will not
have it take up your shill if you pleas i would have taken a
shill yesterday if it had been paid at the time properly; but i told
susan that if it wa not paid then i should keep the hen and so i
shall i promis her you may go back and tell her so

the attorney daughter had whilst rose open her negoti measur
the depth of her purs with a keen eye; and her penetr discov
that it contain at least ten shill with proper manag she had
some hope that the guinea-hen might be made to bring in at least half
the money

rose who wa of a warm temper not quit so fit a match as she had
thought herself for the wili barbara incauti exclaim whatev
it cost us we are determin to have susan favourit hen; so if one
shill wont do take two; and if two wont do whi take three

the shill sound provok upon the tabl as she threw them down
one after anoth and barbara coolli repli three wont do

have you no conscienc miss barbara? then take four barbara shook
her head a fifth shill wa instantli proffered; but bab who now saw
plainli that she had the game in her own hand preserv a cold cruel
silenc rose went on rapidli bid shill after shill till she
had complet empti her purs the twelv shill were spread upon
the tabl barbara avaric wa move she consent for thi ransom to
liber her prison

rose push the money toward her; but just then recollect that she
wa act for other more than for herself and doubt whether she had
full power to conclud such an extravag bargain she gather up the
public treasur and with newly-recov prudenc observ that she must
go back to consult her friend her gener littl friend were amaz
at barbara mean but with one accord declar that they were most
will for their part to give up everi farth of the money they
all went to susan in a bodi and told her so there our purs said
they; do what you pleas with it they would not wait for one word of
thank but ran away leav onli rose with her to settl the treati for
the guinea-hen

there is a certain manner of accept a favour which show true
generos of mind mani know how to give but few know how to accept a
gift properli susan wa touch but not astonish by the kind of
her young friend and she receiv the purs with as much simplic as
she would have given it

well said rose shall i go back for the guinea-hen?

the guinea-hen! said susan start from a reveri into which she had
fallen as she contempl the purs certainli i do long to see my
pretti guinea-hen onc more; but i wa not think of her just then--i
wa think of my father

now susan had heard her mother often in the cours of thi day wish
that she had but money enough in the world to pay john simpson for go
to serv in the militia instead of her husband thi to be sure will
go but a littl way thought susan; but still it may be of some use to
my father she told her mind to rose and conclud by say
decidedli that if the money wa given to her to dispos of as she
pleas she would give it to her father

it is all your my dear good susan cri rose with a look of warm
approb thi is so like you--but im sorri that miss bab must keep
your guinea-hen i would not be her for all the guinea-hen or guinea
either in the whole world whi ill answer for it the guinea-hen
wont make her happi and youll be happi even without; becaus you are
good let me come and help you to-morrow continu she look at
susan work if you have ani more mend work to do--i never like
work till i work with you i wont forget my thimbl or my scissor
ad she laughing--though i use to forget them when i wa a giddi
girl i assur you i am a great hand at my needl now--tri me

susan assur her friend that she did not doubt the power of her needl
and that she would most willingli accept of her servic but that
unluckili she had finish all the needl work immedi want

but do you know said she i shall have a great deal of busi to-
morrow; but i wont tell you what it is that i have to do for i am
afraid i shall not succeed; but if i do succeed ill come and tell you
directli becaus you will be so glad of it

susan who had alway been attent to what her mother taught her and
who had often assist her when she wa bake bread and cake for the
famili at the abbey had now form the courag but not presumptu
idea that she could herself undertak to bake a batch of bread one of
the servant from the abbey had been sent all round the villag in the
morn in search of bread and had not been abl to procur ani that wa
toler mr price last bake fail for want of good barm she
wa not now strong enough to attempt anoth herself; and when the
brewer boy came with eager to tell her that he had some fine fresh
yeast she thank him but sigh and said it would be of no use to
her accordingli she went to work with much prudent care and when her
bread the next morn came out of the oven it wa excellent; at least
her mother said so and she wa a good judg it wa sent to the abbey;
and as the famili there had not tast ani good bread sinc their arriv
in the countri they also were earnest and warm in it prais inquiri
were made from the housekeep and they heard with some surpris that
thi excel bread wa made by a young girl onli twelv year old

the housekeep who had known susan from a child wa pleas to have an
opportun in speak in her favour she is the most industri
littl creatur maam in the world said she to her mistress littl
i cant so well call her now sinc she grown tall and slender to look
at; and glad i am she is grown up like to look at; for handsom is that
handsom does; she think no more of her be handsom than i do myself;
yet she ha as proper a respect for herself maam as you have; and i
alway see her neat and with her mother maam or fit peopl as a girl
should be as for her mother she dote upon her as well she may; for i
should myself if i had half such a daughter; and then she ha two littl
brothers; and she as good to them and my boy philip say taught em
to read more than the school-mistress all with tender and good
nature; but i beg your pardon maam i cannot stop myself when i onc
begin to talk of susan

you have realli said enough to excit my curios said her mistress;
pray send for her immediately; we can see her befor we go out to walk

the benevol housekeep despatch her boy philip for susan who never
happen to be in such an untidi state as to be unabl to obey a summon
without a long prepar she had it is true been veri busy; but
orderli peopl can be busi and neat at the same time she put on her
usual straw hat and accompani rose mother who wa go with a
basket of clear muslin to the abbey

the modest simplic of susan appear and the artless proprieti of
the answer she gave to all the question that were ask her pleas
the ladi at the abbey who were good judg of charact and manner

sir arthur somer had two sister sensibl benevol women they were
not of that race of fine ladi who are miser the moment they come to
the country; nor yet were they of that bustl sort who quack and
direct all their poor neighbour for the mere love of manag or the
want of someth to do they were judici generous; and whilst they
wish to diffus happi they were not peremptori in requir that
peopl should be happi precis their own way with these disposit
and with a well inform brother who though he never wish to direct
wa alway will to assist in their effort to do good there were
reason hope that these ladi would be a bless to the poor
villag amongst whom they were now settl

as soon as miss somer had spoken to susan she inquir for her brother;
but sir arthur wa in hi studi and a gentleman wa with him on
busi

susan wa desir of return to her mother and the ladi therefor
would not detain her miss somer told her with a smile when she took
leav that she would call upon her in the even at six oclock

it wa imposs that such a grand event as susan visit to the abbey
could long remain unknown to barbara case and her gossip maid they
watch eagerli for the moment of her return that they might satisfi
their curios there she is i declar just come into her garden
cri bab; ill run in and get it all out of her in a minut

bab could descend without shame whenev it suit her purpos from
the height of insol pride to the lowest mean of fawn
familiar

susan wa gather some marigold and some parsley for her mother
broth

so susan said bab who came close up to her befor she perceiv it
how goe the world with you to-day?

my mother is rather better to-day she say maam--thank you repli
susan coldli but civilli

maam! dear how polit we are grown of a sudden! cri bab wink at
her maid one may see youv been in good compani thi morning--hey
susan? come let hear about it

did you see the ladi themselv or wa it onli the housekeep sent
for you? said the maid

what room did you go into? continu bab did you see miss somer or
sir arthur?

miss somer

la! she saw miss somers! betti i must hear about it cant you stop
gather those thing for a minut and chat a bit with us susan?

i cant stay inde miss barbara; for my mother broth is just
want and im in a hurri susan ran home

lord her head is full of broth now said bab to her maid; and she ha
not a word for herself though she ha been abroad my papa may well
call her simpl susan; for simpl she is and simpl she will be all the
world over for my part i think she littl better than a downright
simpleton but howev simpl or not ill get what i want out of her
shell be abl to speak mayb when she ha settl the grand matter of
the broth ill step in and ask to see her mother that will put her in
a good humour in a trice

barbara follow susan into the cottag and found her occupi with the
grand affair of the broth is it ready? said bab peep into the pot
that wa over the fire dear how savouri it smells! ill wait till
you go in with it to your mother; for i must ask her how she doe
myself

will you pleas to sit down then miss said simpl susan with a
smile; for at thi instant she forgot the guinea-hen; i have but just
put the parsley into the broth; but it soon will be readi

dure thi interv bab employ herself much to her own satisfact
in cross-quest susan she wa rather provok inde that she
could not learn exactli how each of the ladi wa dress and what
there wa to be for dinner at the abbey; and she wa curiou beyond
measur to find out what miss somer meant by say that she would call
at mr price cottag at six oclock in the even what do you think
she could mean?

i thought she meant what she said repli susan that she would come
here at six oclock

ay that as plain as a pike-staff said barbara; but what els did
she mean think you? peopl you know dont alway mean exactli
downright neither more nor less than what they say

not alway said susan with an arch smile which convinc barbara
that she wa not quit a simpleton

not alway repeat barbara colouring--oh then i suppos you have
some guess at what miss somer meant

no said susan i wa not think about miss somer when i said not
alway

how nice that broth doe look resum barbara after a paus

susan had now pour the broth into a basin and as she strew over it
the bright orang marigold it look veri tempt she tast it and
ad now a littl salt and now a littl more till she thought it wa
just to her mother tast

oh! _i_ must tast it said bab take the basin up greedili

wont you take a spoon? said susan trembl at the larg mouth
which barbara suck up with a terribl nois

take a spoon indeed! exclaim barbara set down the basin in
high anger the next time i tast your broth you shall affront me if
you dare! the next time i set my foot in thi hous you shall be as
sauci to me as you pleas and she flounc out of the hous repeat
take a spoon pig wa what you meant to say

susan stood in amaz at the begin of thi speech; but the
conclud word explain to her the mysteri

some year befor thi time when susan wa a veri littl girl and could
scarc speak plain as she wa eat a basin of bread and milk for her
supper at the cottag door a great pig came up and put hi nose into
the basin susan wa will that the pig should have some share of the
bread and milk; but as she ate with a spoon and he with hi larg mouth
she present discov that he wa like to have more than hi share;
and in a simpl tone of expostul she said to him take a poon
pig* the say becom proverbi in the villag susan littl
companion repeat it and appli it upon mani occas whenev
anyon claim more than hi share of anyth good barbara who wa
then not miss barbara but plain bab and who had play with all the
poor children in the neighbourhood wa often reprov in her unjust
method of divis by susan proverb susan as she grew up forgot
the childish saying; but the remembr of it rankl in barbara mind
and it wa to thi that she suspect susan had allud when she
recommend a spoon to her whilst she wa swallow the basin of broth

*thi is a true anecdot

la miss said barbara maid when she found her mistress in a passion
upon her return from susan i onli wonder you did her the honour to
set your foot within her door what need have you to troubl her for
news about the abbey folk when your own papa ha been there all the
morn and is just come in and can tell you everything?

barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the abbey that
morn for attorney case wa mysteri even to hi own famili about
hi morn ride he never chose to be ask where he wa go or
where he had been; and thi made hi servant more than commonli
inquisit to trace him

barbara against whose appar childish and real cun he wa not
suffici on hi guard had often the art of draw him into
convers about hi visit she ran into her father parlour; but
she knew the moment she saw hi face that it wa no time to ask
questions; hi pen wa across hi mouth and hi brown wig push obliqu
upon hi contract forehead the wig wa alway push crook whenev
he wa in a brown or rather a black studi barbara who did not like
susan bear with her father testi humour from affect and gentl
of disposit but who alway humour him from artific tri all her
skill to fathom hi thought and when she found that it would not do
she went to tell her maid so and to complain that her father wa so
cross there wa no bear him

it is true that attorney case wa not in the happiest mood possible; for
he wa by no mean satisfi with hi morn work at the abbey sir
arthur somer the new man did not suit him and he began to be rather
apprehens that he should not suit sir arthur he had sound reason
for hi doubt

sir arthur somer wa an excel lawyer and a perfectli honest man
thi seem to our attorney a contradict in terms; in the cours of
hi practic the case had not occurred; and he had no preced readi to
direct hi proceed sir arthur wa also a man of wit and eloqu
yet of plain deal and human the attorney could not persuad
himself to believ that hi benevol wa anyth but enlighten
cun and hi plain deal he one minut dread as the masterpiec
of art and the next despis as the characterist of folli in short
he had not yet decid whether he wa an honest man or a knave he had
settl account with him for hi late agenc and had talk about
sundri matter of busi he constantli perceiv howev that he
could not impos upon sir arthur; but the idea that he could know all the
maze of the law and yet prefer the straight road wa incomprehens

mr case have paid sir arthur some compliment on hi great legal
abil and hi high reput at the bar he coolli repli i have
left the bar the attorney look in unfeign astonish that a man
who wa actual make 3ooo pound per annum at the bar should leav
it

i am come said sir arthur to enjoy that kind of domest life in the
countri which i prefer to all other and amongst peopl whose happi
i hope to increas at thi speech the attorney chang hi ground
flatter himself that he should find hi man avers to busi and
ignor of countri affair he talk of the valu of land and of new
leas

sir arthur wish to enlarg hi domain and to make a ride round it a
map of it wa lie upon the tabl and farmer price garden came
exactli across the new road for the ride sir arthur look
disappointed; and the keen attorney seiz the moment to inform him that
price whole land wa at hi dispos

at my disposal! how so? cri sir arthur eagerly; it will not be out
of leas i believ these ten year ill look into the rent roll
again; perhap i am mistaken

you are mistaken my good sir and you are not mistaken said mr case
with a shrewd smile in one sens the land will not be out of leas
these ten year and in anoth it is out of leas at thi present time
to come to the point at onc the leas is ab origin null and void i
have detect a capit flaw in the bodi of it i pledg my credit upon
it sir it cant stand a singl term in law or equiti

the attorney observ that at these word sir arthur eye wa fix
with a look of earnest attent now i have him said the cun
tempter to himself

neither in law nor equiti repeat sir arthur with appar
incredul are you sure of that mr case?

sure! as i told you befor sir id pledg my whole credit upon the
thing--id stake my exist

that someth said sir arthur as if he wa ponder upon the
matter

the attorney went on with all the eager of a keen man who see a
chanc at one stroke of win a rich friend and of ruin a poor
enemi he explain with legal volubl and technic amplif
the natur of the mistak in mr price leas it wa sir said he
a leas for the life of peter price susanna hi wife and to the
survivor or survivor of them or for the full time and term of twenti
year to be comput from the first day of may then next ensu now
sir thi you see is a leas in revers which the late sir benjamin
somer had not by hi settlement a right to make thi is a curiou
mistak you see sir arthur; and in fill up those print leas
there alway a good chanc of some flaw i find it perpetually; but i
never found a better than thi in the whole cours of my practic

sir arthur stood in silenc

my dear sir said the attorney take him by the button you have no
scrupl of stir in thi business?

a littl said sir arthur

whi then that can be done away in a moment your name shall not
appear in it at all you have noth to do but to make over the leas
to me i make all safe to you with my bond now be in possess i
come forward in my own proper person shall i proceed?

no--you have said enough repli sir arthur

the case inde lie in a nutshel said the attorney who had by
thi time work himself up to such a pitch of profession enthusiasm
that intent upon hi vision of a lawsuit he total forgot to observ
the impress hi word made upon sir arthur

there onli one thing we have forgotten all thi time said sir
arthur

what can that be sir?

that we shall ruin thi poor man

case wa thunderstruck at these word or rather by the look which
accompani them he recollect that he had laid himself open befor he
wa sure of sir arthur real charact he soften and said he should
have had certainli more consider in the case of ani but a litigi
pig-head fellow as he knew price to be

if he be litigi said sir arthur i shall certainli be glad to get
him fairli out of the parish as soon as possibl when you go home you
will be so good sir as to send me hi leas that i may satisfi myself
befor we stir in thi busi

the attorney brighten up prepar to take leave; but he could not
persuad himself to take hi departur without make one push at sir
arthur about the agenc

i will not troubl you sir arthur with thi leas of price said
case; ill leav it with your agent whom shall i appli to?

to myself sir if you pleas repli sir arthur

the courtier of loui the fourteenth could not have look more
astound than our attorney when they receiv from their monarch a
similar answer it wa thi unexpect repli of sir arthur which had
derang the temper of mr case and caus hi wig to stand so crook
upon hi forehead and which had render him impenetr silent to hi
inquisit daughter barbara

after have walk up and down hi room convers with himself for
some time the attorney conclud that the agenc must be given to
somebodi when sir arthur should have to attend hi duti in parliament;
that the agenc even for the winter season wa not a thing to be
neglected; and that if he manag well he might yet secur it for
himself he had often found that small time present work

susan close the curtain and wa silent she could not say amen she
wa call out of the room at thi moment for a messeng wa come from
the abbey for the bread-bil it wa she who alway made out the bill
for though she had not a great number of lesson from the writing-mast
she had taken so much pain to learn that she could write a veri neat
legibl hand and she found thi veri use she wa not to be sure
particularli inclin to draw out a long bill at thi instant but
busi must be done she set to work rule her line for the pound
shill and penc made out the bill for the abbey and despatch the
impati messeng she then resolv to make out all the bill for the
neighbour who had mani of them taken a few loav and roll of her
bake i had better get all my busi finish said she to
herself befor i go down to the meadow to take leav of my poor lamb

thi wa sooner said than done for she found that she had a great number
of bill to write and the slate on which she had enter the account wa
not immedi to be found; and when it wa found the figur were
almost rub out barbara had sat down upon it susan pore over the
number of loav and the name of the person who took them; and she
wrote and cast up sum and correct and re-correct them till her
head grew quit puzzl

the tabl wa cover with littl squar bit of paper on which she had
been write bill over and over again when her father came in with a
bill in hi hand how thi susan? said he how can ye be so
careless child? what is your head run upon? here look at the bill

susan look and blushed; it wa written sir arthur somer to john
price debtor six dozen lamb so much she alter it and return
it to her father; but he had taken up some of the paper which lay upon
the tabl what are all these child?

some of them are wrong and ive written them out again said susan

some of them! all of them i think seem to be wrong if i can read
said her father rather angrili and he point out to her sundri strang
mistak her head inde had been run upon her poor lamb she
correct all the mistak with so much patienc and bore to be blame
with so much good humour that her father at last said that it wa
imposs ever to scold susan without be in the wrong at the last

as soon as all wa set right price took the bill and said he would go
round to the neighbour and collect the money himself; for that he
should be veri proud to have it to say to them that it wa all earn by
hi own littl daughter

susan resolv to keep the pleasur of tell him of hi week repriev
till he should come home to sup as he had promis to do in her
mother room she wa not sorri to hear him sigh as he pass the
knapsack which she had been pack up for hi journey how delight
he will be when he hear the good news! said she to herself; but i
know he will be a littl sorri too for my poor lamb

as susan had now settl all her busi she thought she could have
time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite; but
just as she had tie on her straw hat the villag clock struck four and
thi wa the hour at which she alway went to fetch her littl brother
home from a dame-school near the villag she knew that they would be
disappoint if she wa later than usual and she did not like to keep
them wait becaus they were veri patient good boys; so she put off
the visit to her lamb and went immedi for her brother



chapter ii

evn in the spring and playtim of the year
that call th unwont villag abroad
with all her littl one a sportiv train
to gather king-cup in the yellow mead
and prink their head with daisi
cowper

the dame-school which wa about a mile from the hamlet wa not a showi
edifice; but it wa reverenc as much by the young race of villag
scholar as if it had been the most state mansion in the land; it wa a
low roof long thatch tenement shelter by a few reverend oak
under which mani gener of hope children had gambol in their
turn

the close shaven green which slope down from the hatch-door of the
schoolroom wa pale round with a rude pale which though decay in
some part by time wa not in ani place broken by violenc

the place bespok order and peac the dame who govern wa well
obey becaus she wa just and well belov and becaus she wa ever
glad to give well earn prais and pleasur to her littl subject

susan had onc been under her gentl dominion and had been deservedli
her favourit scholar the dame often cite her as the best exampl to
the succeed tribe of emul youngster she had scarc open the
wicket which separ the green befor the schoolroom door from the
lane when she heard the merri voic of the children and saw the littl
troup issu from the hatchway and spread over the green

oh there susan! cri her two littl brother run leap and
bound up to her; and mani of the other rosi girl and boy crowd
round her to talk of their plays; for susan wa easili interest in all
that made other happy; but she could not make them comprehend that if
they all spoke at onc it wa not possibl that she could hear what wa
said

the voic were still rais one abov anoth all eager to establish
some import observ about ninepin or marbl or top or bow
and arrow when suddenli music wa heard and the crowd wa silenc
the music seem to be near the spot where the children were stand
and they look round to see whenc it could come susan point to the
great oak-tre and they beheld seat under it shade an old man
play upon hi harp the children all approached--at first timidli
for the sound were solemn; but as the harper heard their littl
footstep come toward him he chang hi hand and play one of hi
most live tune the circl close and press nearer and nearer to
him; some who were in the foremost row whisper to each other he is
blind! what a pity! and he look veri poor--what a rag coat he
wears! said other he must be veri old for all hi hair is white;
and he must have travel a great way for hi shoe are quit worn
out observ anoth

all these remark were made whilst he wa tune hi harp for when he
onc more began to play not a word wa utter he seem pleas by
their simpl exclam of wonder and delight and eager to amus hi
young audienc he play now a gay and now a pathet air to suit their
sever humour

susan voic which wa soft and sweet express of gentl and
good natur caught hi ear the moment she spoke he turn hi face
eagerli to the place where she stood; and it wa observ that whenev
she said that she like ani tune particularli he play it over again

i am blind said the old man and cannot see your faces; but i know
you all asund by your voic and i can guess pretti well at all your
humour and charact by your voic

can you so indeed? cri susan littl brother william who had
station himself between the old man knee then you heard my sister
susan speak just now can you tell us what sort of person she is?

that i can i think without be a conjur said the old man
lift the boy up on hi knee; your sister susan is good-natur the
boy clap hi hand and good-temp right said littl
william with a louder clap of applaus and veri fond of the littl
boy who sit upon my knee o right! right! quit right! exclaim the
child and quit right echo on all side

but how came you to know so much when you are blind? said william
examin the old man attent

hush said john who wa a year older than hi brother and veri sage
you should not put him in mind of hi be blind

though i am blind said the harper i can hear you know and i heard
from your sister herself all that i told you of her that she wa good-
temper and good-natur and fond of you

oh that wrong--you did not hear all that from herself im sure
said john for nobodi ever hear her prais herself

did not i hear her tell you said the harper when you first came
round me that she wa in a great hurri to go home but that she would
stay a littl while sinc you wish it so much? wa not that good-
natured? and when you said you did not like the tune she like best she
wa not angri with you but said then play william first if you
please--wa not that good-tempered?

oh interrupt william it all true; but how did you find out that
she wa fond of me?

that is such a difficult question said the harper that i must take
time to consid the harper tune hi instrument as he ponder or
seem to ponder: and at thi instant two boy who had been search
for bird nest in the hedg and who had heard the sound of the harp
came bluster up and push their way through the circl one of them
exclaim what go on here? who are you my old fellow? a blind
harper! well play us a tune if you can play ever a good one--play me--
let see what shall he play bob? ad he turn to hi companion
bumper squir jone

the old man though he did not seem quit pleas with the peremptori
manner of the request play as he wa desir bumper squir jones;
and sever other tune were afterward bespok by the same rough and
tyrann voic

the littl children shrunk back in timid silenc and eye the brutal boy
with dislik thi boy wa the son of attorney case; and as hi father
had neglect to correct hi temper when he wa a child as he grew up it
becam insuffer all who were younger and weaker than himself
dread hi approach and detest him as a tyrant

when the old harper wa so tire that he could play no more a lad who
usual carri hi harp for him and who wa within call came up and
held hi master hat to the compani say will you be pleas to
rememb us? the children readili produc their halfpenc and thought
their wealth well bestow upon thi poor good-natur man who had
taken so much pain to entertain them better even than upon the
gingerbread woman whose stall they love to frequent the hat wa held
some time to the attorney son befor he chose to see it at last he
put hi hand surlili into hi waistcoat pocket and pull out a shill
there were sixpennyworth of halfpenc in the hat ill take these
halfpenc said he and here a shill for you

god bless you sir said the lad; but as he took the shill which the
young gentleman had slili put into the blind man hand he saw that it
wa not worth one farth i am afraid it is not good sir said the
lad whose busi it wa to examin the money for hi master

i am afraid then youll get no other said young case with an
insult laugh

it never will do sir persist the lad; look at it yourself; the
edg are all yellow! you can see the copper through it quit plain
sir nobodi will take it from us

that your affair said the brutal boy push away hi hand you
may pass it you know as well as i do if you look sharp you have
taken it from me and i shant take it back again i promis you

a whisper of that veri unjust wa heard the littl assembl
though under evid constraint could no longer suppress their
indign

who say it unjust? cri the tyrant sternli look down upon hi
judg

susan littl brother had held her gown fast to prevent her from
move at the begin of thi contest and she wa now so much
interest to see the end of it that she stood still without make ani
resist

is anyon here amongst yourselv a judg of silver? said the old man

ye here the butcher boy said the attorney son; show it to
him he wa a sickly-look boy and of a remark peac
disposit young case fanci that he would be afraid to give judgment
against him howev after some moment hesit and after turn
the shill round sever time he pronounc that as far as hi
judgment went but he did not pretend to be a downright certain sure of
it the shill wa not over and abov good then to susan to screen
himself from manifest danger for the attorney son look upon him with
a veng mien but here susan here who understand silver a great
deal better than i do; she take a power of it for bread you know

ill leav it to her said the old harper; if she say the shill is
good keep it jack the shill wa hand to susan who though she
had with becom modesti forborn all interfer did not hesit
when she wa call upon to speak the truth: i think that thi
shill is a bad one said she; and the gentl but firm tone in which
she pronounc the word for a moment awe and silenc the angri and
brutal boy there anoth then cri he; i have sixpenc and
shill too in plenti thank my star

susan now walk away with her two littl brother and all the other
children separ to go to their sever home the old harper call
to susan and beg that if she wa go toward the villag she
would be so kind as to show him the way hi lad took up hi harp and
littl william took the old man by the hand ill lead him i can lead
him said he; and john ran on befor them to gather king-cup in the
meadow

there wa a small rivulet which they had to cross and as a plank which
serv for a bridg over it wa rather narrow susan wa afraid to trust
the old blind man to hi littl conductor; she therefor went on the
totter plank first herself and then led the old harper care
over they were now come to a gate which open upon the high road to
the villag there is the high road straight befor you said susan to
the lad who wa carri hi master harp; you cant miss it now i
must bid you a good evening; for im in a great hurri to get home and
must go the short way across the field here which would not be so
pleasant for you becaus of the stile good-by the old harper
thank her and went along the high road whilst she and her brother
trip on as fast as they could by the short way across the field

miss somer i am afraid will be wait for us said susan you
know she said she would call at six; and by the length of our shadow im
sure it is late

when they came to their own cottage-door they heard mani voic and
they saw when they enter sever ladi stand in the kitchen
come in susan; we thought you had quit forsaken us said miss somer
to susan who advanc timidli i fanci you forgot that we promis to
pay you a visit thi even but you need not blush so much about the
matter; there is no great harm done; we have onli been here about five
minutes; and we have been well employ in admir your neat garden and
your orderli shelv is it you susan who keep these thing in such
nice order? continu miss somer look round the kitchen

befor susan could repli littl william push forward and answer
ye maam it is my sister susan that keep everyth neat; and she
alway come to school for us too which wa what caus her to be so
late

becaus as how continu john she wa loth to refus us the hear
a blind man play on the harp it wa we kept her and we hope maam
as you are--a you seem so good you wont take it amiss

miss somer and her sister smile at the affection simplic with
which susan littl brother undertook her defenc and they were from
thi slight circumst dispos to think yet more favour of a
famili which seem so well unit they took susan along with them
through the villag mani neighbour came to their door and far from
envi they all secretli wish susan well as she pass

i fanci we shall find what we want here said miss somer stop
befor a shop where unfold sheet of pin and glass button glisten
in the window and where roll of mani colour ribbon appear rang
in tempt order she went in and wa rejoic to see the shelv at
the back of the counter well-furnish with glossi tier of stuff and
gay neat print linen and calico

now susan choos yourself a gown said miss somers; you set an
exampl of industri and good conduct of which we wish to take public
notic for the benefit of other

the shopkeep who wa father to susan friend rose look much
satisfi by thi speech and as if a compliment had been paid to
himself bow low to miss somer and then with alert which a
london linen-drap might have admir produc piec after piec of hi
best good to hi young customer--unrol unfold held the bright
stuff and calend calico in variou light now stretch hi arm
to the highest shelv and brought down in a trice what seem to be
beyond the reach of ani but a giant arm; now dive into some hidden
recess beneath the counter and brought to light fresh beauti and fresh
temptat

susan look on with more indiffer than most of the spectat she
wa think much of her lamb and more of her father

miss somer had put a bright guinea into her hand and had bid her pay
for her own gown; but susan as she look at the guinea thought it wa
a great deal of money to lay out upon herself and she wish but did
know like to ask that she might keep it for a better purpos

some peopl are wholli inattent to the lesser feel and incap
of read the counten of those on whom they bestow their bounti
miss somer and her sister were not of thi roughli charit class

she doe not like ani of these thing whisper miss somer to her
sister her sister observ that susan look as if her thought were
far distant from gown

if you dont fanci ani of these said the civil shopkeep to susan
we shall have a new assort of calico for the spring season soon
from town

oh interrupt susan with a smile and a blush; these are all pretti
and too good for me but--

but what susan? said miss somer tell us what is pass in your
littl mind susan hesit well then we will not press you you
are scarc acquaint with us yet; when you are you will not be
afraid i hope to speak your mind put thi shine yellow counter
continu she point to the guinea in your pocket and make what use
of it you pleas from what we know and from what we have heard of you
we are persuad that you will make a good use of it

i think madam said the master of the shop with a shrewd good
natur look i could give a pretti good guess myself what will becom
of that guinea; but i say noth

no that is right said miss somers; we leav susan entir at
liberty; and now we will not detain her ani longer good night susan
we shall soon come again to your neat cottag susan curtsi with an
express look of gratitud and with a modest frank in her
counten which seem to say i would tell you and welcom what i
want to do with the guinea; but i am not use to speak befor so mani
peopl when you come to our cottag again you shall know all

when susan had depart miss somer turn to the oblig shopkeep
who wa fold up all the thing he had open you have had a great
deal of troubl with us sir said she; and sinc susan will not choos
a gown for herself i must she select the prettiest; and whilst the
man wa roll it in paper she ask him sever question about susan
and her famili which he wa delight to answer becaus he had now all
opportun of say as much as he wish in her prais

no later back maam than last may morn said he as my daughter
rose wa tell us susan did a turn in her quiet way by her mother
that would not displeas you if you were to hear it she wa to have
been queen of the may which in our littl villag amongst the younger
tribe is a thing that is thought of a good deal; but susan mother wa
ill and susan after sit up with her all night would not leav her
in the morn even when they brought the crown to her she put the
crown upon my daughter rose head with her own hands; and to be sure
rose love her as well as if she wa her own sister but i dont speak
from partiality; for i am no relat whatev to the prices--onli a
well-wish as everyon i believ who know them is ill send the
parcel up to the abbey shall i maam?

if you pleas said miss somer and as soon as you receiv your new
thing from town let us know you will i hope find us good custom
and well-wish ad she with a smile; for those who wish well to
their neighbour sure deserv to have well-wish themselv

a few word may encourag the benevol passion and may dispos peopl
to live in peac and happiness; a few word may set them at varianc and
may lead to miseri and lawsuit attorney case and miss somer were both
equal convinc of thi and their practic wa uniformli consist
with their principl

but now to return to susan she put the bright guinea care into the
glove with the twelv shill which she had receiv from her
companion on may day besid thi treasur she calcul that the
amount of the bill for bread could not be less than eight or nine and
thirti shillings; and as her father wa now sure of a week repriev
she had great hope that by some mean or other it would be possibl to
make up the whole sum necessari to pay for a substitut if that could
but be done said she to herself how happi would my mother be she
would be quit stout again for she certainli is a great deal better
sinc i told her that father would stay a week longer ah! but she would
not have bless attorney case though if she had known about my poor
daisi

susan took the path that led to the meadow by the watersid resolv to
go by herself and take leav of her innoc favourit but she did not
pass by unperceiv her littl brother were watch for her return
and as soon as they saw her they ran after her and overtook her as she

in hi sister face he saw tear in her eye and he wa silent and
walk on quietli susan saw her lamb by the water-sid who are those
two men? said william what are they go to do with daisy? the two
men were attorney case and the butcher the butcher wa feel whether
the lamb wa fat

susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow; her littl brother ran up
to the butcher and demand whether he wa go to do ani harm to the
lamb the butcher did not answer but the attorney repli it is not
your sister lamb ani longer; it mine--min to all intent and
purpos

the littl boy now burst into pierc lament they push away
the butcher hand; they threw their arm round the neck of the lamb;
they kiss it forehead--it bleat it will not bleat to-morrow!
said william and he wept bitterli the butcher look asid and
hastili rub hi eye with the corner of hi blue apron

the attorney stood unmoved; he pull up the head of the lamb which had
just stoop to crop a mouth of clover i have no time to wast
said he; butcher youll account with me if it fat--th sooner the
better ive no more to say and he walk off deaf to the prayer of
the poor children

as soon as the attorney wa out of sight susan rose from the bank where
she wa seat came up to her lamb and stoop to gather some of the
fresh dewi trefoil to let it eat out of her hand for the last time
poor daisi lick her well known hand

now let us go said susan

must take though so be i shall be the loser thereby; but well say
noth to the boy for fear it might be the thing would not take; and
then it would be wors again to poor susan who is a good girl and

he aloud to the children; turn the lamb in here john in the paddock

and as mr case wa impati to make hi offer to sir arthur he

heart good susan here twenty-nin shill and the abbey bill
which is not paid yet come to ten more what think you of thi wife?
have we not a right to be proud of our susan? whi continu he

stranger in prais of my own which i know is not mannerly; but the
truth is the fittest thing to be spoken as i think at all times;
therefor here your good health susan; whi by-and-bi shell be worth
her weight in gold--in silver at least but tell us child how came you

happi news make me so gay in myself im afraid i shall hardli
understand it rightli but speak on child--first bring us a bottl
of the good mead you made last year from your own honey

susan did not much like to tell the histori of her guinea-hen--of the
gown and of her poor lamb part of thi would seem as if she wa
vaunt of her own generos and part of it she did not like to
recollect but her mother press to know the whole and she relat it
as simpli as she could when she came to the stori of her lamb her
voic falter and everybodi present wa touch the old harper sigh
onc and clear hi throat sever time he then ask for hi harp
and after tune it for a consider time he recollected--for he had
often fit of absence--that he sent for it to play the tune he had
promis to the boy

thi harper came from a great distanc from the mountain of wale to
contend with sever other competitor for a prize which had been
advertis by a music societi about a year befor thi time there wa
to be a splendid ball given upon the occas at shrewsburi which wa
about five mile from our villag the prize wa ten guinea for the
best perform on the harp and the prize wa now to be decid in a few
day

all thi intellig barbara had long sinc gain from her maid who
often paid visit to the town of shrewsburi and she had long had her
imagin inflam with the idea of thi splendid music-meet and
ball often had she sigh to be there and often had she revolv in
her mind scheme for introduc herself to some genteel neighbour who
might take her to the ball in their carriag how rejoic how
triumphant wa she when thi veri even just about the time when the
butcher wa bargain with her father about susan lamb a servant from
the abbey rap at the door and left a card for mr and miss barbara
case

there cri bab _i_ and papa are to dine and drink tea at the abbey
tomorrow who knows? i daresay when they see that im not a vulgar
person and all that; and if i go cunningli to work with miss somer as
i shall to be sure i daresay shell take me to the ball with her

to be sure said the maid; it the least one may expect from a ladi
who demean herself to visit susan price and goe about a-shop for
her the least she can do for you is to take you in her carriag which
cost noth but is just a common civil to a ball

then pray betti continu miss barbara dont forget to-morrow the
first thing you do to send off to shrewsburi for my new bonnet i must
have it to dine in at the abbey or the ladi will think noth of me;
and betti rememb the mantua-mak too i must see and coax papa to
buy me a new gown against the ball i can see you know someth of
the fashion to-morrow at the abbey i shall look the ladi well over
i promis you and betti i have thought of the most charm present
for miss somer as papa say it good never to go empty-hand to a
great hous ill make miss somer who is fond as her maid told you of
such things--il make miss somer a present of that guinea-hen of
susans; it of no use to me so do you carri it up earli in the morn
to the abbey with my compliment that the thing

in full confid that her present and her bonnet would oper
effectu in her favour miss barbara paid her first visit at the
abbey she expect to see wonder she wa dress in all the fineri
which she had heard from her maid who had heard from the prentic of a
shrewsburi millin wa the thing in london; and she wa much surpris
and disappoint when she wa shown into the room where the miss
somers and the ladi of the abbey were sit to see that they did
not in ani one part of their dress agre with the pictur her
imagin had form of fashion ladi she wa embarrass when
she saw book and work and draw upon the tabl and she began to
think that some affront wa meant to her becaus the compani did not sit
with their hand befor them

when miss somer endeavour to find out convers that would interest
her and spoke of walk and flower and garden of which she wa
herself fond miss barbara still thought herself undervalu and soon
contriv to expos her ignor most complet by talk of thing
which she did not understand

those who never attempt to appear what they are not--thos who do not in
their manner pretend to anyth unsuit to their habit and situat
in life never are in danger of be laugh at by sensibl well bred
peopl of ani rank; but affect is the constant and just object of
ridicul

miss barbara case with her mistaken air of gentil aim to be
thought a woman and a fine ladi whilst she wa in realiti a child and
a vulgar attorney daughter render herself so thoroughli ridicul
that the good natur yet discern spectat were pain divid
between their sens of comic absurd and a feel of shame for one who
could feel noth for herself

one by one the ladi drop off miss somer went out of the room for
a few minut to alter her dress as it wa the custom of the famili
befor dinner she left a portfolio of pretti draw and good print
for miss barbara amusement; but miss barbara thought were so intent
upon the harper ball that she could not be entertain with such
trifl how unhappi are those who spend their time in expectation!
they can never enjoy the present moment whilst barbara wa contriv
mean of interest miss somer in her favour she recollect with
surpris that not one word had yet been said of her present of the
guinea-hen mr betti in the hurri of her dress her young ladi in
the morn had forgotten it; but it came just whilst miss somer wa
dressing; and the housekeep came into her mistress room to announc
it arriv

maam said she here a beauti guinea-hen just come with miss
barbara case compliment to you

miss somer knew by the tone which the housekeep deliv thi
messag that there wa someth in the busi which did not perfectli
pleas her she made no answer in expect that the housekeep who
wa a woman of a veri open temper would explain her caus of
dissatisfact in thi she wa not mistaken the housekeep came
close up to the dress tabl and continu i never like to speak
till im sure maam and im not quit sure to say certain in thi
case maam but still i think it right to tell you which cant wrong
anybodi what came across my mind about thi same guinea-hen maam; and
you can inquir into it and do as you pleas afterward maam some
time ago we had fine guinea-fowl of our own and i made bold not
think to be sure that all our own would die away from us as they
have done to give a fine coupl last christma to susan price and veri
fond and pleas she wa at the time and im sure would never have
part with the hen with her good-will; but if my eye dont strang
mistak thi hen that come from miss barbara is the selfsam
ident guinea-hen that i gave to susan and how miss bab came by it
is the thing that puzzl me if my boy philip wa at home mayb as
he often at mr price (which i dont disapprove) he might know the
histori of the guinea-hen i expect him home thi night and if you have
no object i will sift the affair

the shortest way i think said henrietta would be to ask miss case
herself about it which i will do thi even

if you pleas maam said the housekeep coldly; for she knew that
miss barbara wa not famou in the villag for speak truth

dinner wa now serv attorney case expect to smell mint sauc and
as the cover were taken from off the dish look around for lamb; but
no lamb appear he had a dexter knack of twist the convers
to hi point sir arthur wa speak when they sat down to dinner of
a new carv knife which he late had had made for hi sister the
attorney immedi went from carving-kn to poultry; thenc to
butcher meat some joint he observ were much more difficult to
carv than other he never saw a man carv better than the gentleman
opposit him who wa the curat of the parish but sir said the
vulgar attorney i must make bold to differ with you in one point and
ill appeal to sir arthur sir arthur pray may i ask when you carv a
forequart of lamb do you when you rais the shoulder throw in salt
or not? thi well prepar question wa not lost upon sir arthur the
attorney wa thank for hi intend present; but mortifi and
surpris to hear sir arthur say that it wa a constant rule of hi never
to accept of ani present from hi neighbour if we were to accept a
lamb from a rich neighbour on my estat said he i am afraid we should
mortifi mani of our poor tenant who can have littl to offer though
perhap they may bear us thorough good-wil notwithstand

after the ladi left the dining-room as they were walk up and down
the larg hall miss barbara had a fair opportun of imit her keen
father method of convers one of the ladi observ that thi
hall would be a charm place for music bab brought in harp and
harper and the harper ball in a breath i know so much about it--
about the ball i mean said she becaus a ladi in shrewsburi a friend
of papa offer to take me with her; but papa did not like to give her
the troubl of send so far for me though she ha a coach of her own
barbara fix her eye upon miss somer as she spoke; but she could not
read her counten as distinctli as she wish becaus miss somer wa
at thi moment let down the veil of her hat

shall we walk out befor tea? said miss somer to her companions; i
have a pretti guinea-hen to show you barbara secretli draw
propiti omen from the guinea-hen follow with a confidenti step
the pheasantri wa well fill with pheasant peacock etc and
susan pretti littl guinea-hen appear well even in thi high
compani it wa much admir barbara wa in glory; but her glori wa
of short durat

just as miss somer wa go to inquir into the guinea-hen histori
philip came up to ask permiss to have a bit of sycamor to turn a
nutmeg box for hi mother he wa an ingeni lad and a good turner
for hi age sir arthur had put by a bit of sycamor on purpos for
him; and miss somer told him where it wa to be found he thank her:
but in the midst of hi bow of thank hi eye wa struck by the sight of
the guinea-hen and he involuntarili exclaim susan guinea-hen i
declare! no it not susan guinea-hen said miss barbara
colour furiously; it is mine and i have made a present of it to miss
somer

at the sound of bab voic philip turned--saw her--and indign
unrestrain by the presenc of all the amaz spectat flash in hi
counten

what is the matter philip? said miss somer in a pacifi tone; but
philip wa not inclin to be pacifi whi maam said he may i
speak out? and without wait for permiss he spoke out and gave a
full true and warm account of rose embassi and of miss barbara
cruel and avarici proceed

barbara deni prevar stammer and at last wa overcom with
confusion; for which even the most indulg spectat could scarc
piti her

miss somer howev mind of what wa due to her guest wa anxiou
to dispatch philip for hi piec of sycamor bab recov herself as
soon as he wa out of sight; but she further expos herself by
exclaim im sure i wish thi piti guinea-hen had never come into
my possess i wish susan had kept it at home as she should have
done!

perhap she will be more care now that she ha receiv so strong a
lesson said miss somer shall we tri her? continu she philip
will i daresay take the guinea-hen back to susan if we desir it

if you pleas maam said barbara sullenly; i have noth more to
do with it

so the guinea-hen wa deliv to philip who set off joy with hi
prize and wa soon in sight of farmer price cottag he stop when
he came to the door he recollect rose and her gener friendship for
susan he wa determin that she should have the pleasur of restor
the guinea-hen he ran into the villag all the children who had given
up their littl purs on may day were assembl on the play-green they
were delight to see the guinea-hen onc more philip took hi pipe and
tabor and they march in innoc triumph toward the whitewash
cottag

let me come with you--let me come with you said the butcher boy to
philip stop one minute! my father ha someth to say to you he
dart into hi father hous the littl process stop and in a
few minut the bleat of a lamb wa heard through a back passag
which led into the paddock behind the hous they saw the butcher lead
a lamb

it is daisy! exclaim rose--it daisy! repeat all her companion
susan lamb! susan lamb! and there wa a univers shout of joy

well for my part said the good butcher as soon as he could be
heard--for my part i would not be so cruel as attorney case for the
whole world these poor brute beast dont know aforehand what go
to happen to them; and as for die it what we must all do some time
or another; but to keep wring the heart of the live that have as
much sens as one self is what i call cruel; and is not thi what
attorney case ha been do by poor susan and her whole famili ever
sinc he took a spite against them? but at anyr here susan lamb
safe and sound id have taken it back sooner but i wa off befor day
to the fair and am but just come back daisi howev ha been as well
off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the watersid

the oblig shopkeep who show the pretti calico to susan wa now
at hi door and when he saw the lamb and heard that it wa susan and
learn it histori he said that he would add hi mite; and he gave the
children some end of narrow riband with which rose decor her
friend lamb

the pipe and tabor now onc more began to play and the process move
on in joy order after give the human butcher three cheers; three
cheer which were better deserv than loud huzza usual are

susan wa work in her arbour with her littl deal tabl befor her
when she heard the sound of the music she put down her work and
listen she saw the crowd of children come nearer and nearer they
had close round daisi so that she did not see it; but as they came up
to the garden gate she saw that rose beckon to her philip play as
loud as he could that she might not hear till the proper moment the
bleat of the lamb susan open the garden-wicket and at thi signal
the crowd divid and the first thing that susan saw in the midst of
her taller friend wa littl smile mari with the guinea-hen in her
arm

come on! come on! cri mari as susan start with joy surprise;
you have more to see

at thi instant the music paus susan heard the bleat of a lamb and
scarc dare to believ her sens she press eagerli forward and
beheld poor daisy!--sh burst into tear i did not shed one tear when
i part with you my dear littl daisy! said she it wa for my
father and mother i would not have part with you for anyth els in
the whole world thank you thank you all ad she to her
companion who sympath in her joy even more than they had
sympath in her sorrow now if my father wa not to go away from us
next week and if my mother wa quit stout i should be the happiest
person in the world!

as susan pronounc these word a voic behind the littl listen
crowd cri in a brutal tone let us pass if you please; you have no
right to stop up the public road! thi wa the voic of attorney case
who wa return with hi daughter barbara from hi visit to the abbey
he saw the lamb and tri to whistl as he went on barbara also saw
the guinea-hen and turn her head anoth way that she might avoid the
contemptu reproach look of those whom she onli affect to
despis even her new bonnet in which she had expect to be so much
admir wa now onli servic to hide her face and conceal her
mortif

i am glad she saw the guinea-hen cri rose who now held it in her
hand

ye said philip shell not forget may day in a hurri

nor i neither i hope said susan look round upon her companion
with a most affection smile: i hope whilst i live i shall never
forget your good to me last may day now ive my pretti guinea-hen
safe onc more i should think of return your money

no! no! no! wa the gener cri we dont want the money--keep it
keep it--you want it for your father

well said susan i am not too proud to be oblig i will keep your
money for my father perhap some time or other i may be abl to earn--

oh interrupt philip dont let us talk of earning; dont let us
talk to her of money now; she ha not had time hardli to look at poor
daisi and her guinea-hen come we must go about our busi and let
her have them all to herself

the crowd move away in consequ of philip consider advice: but
it wa observ that he wa the veri last to stir from the garden-wicket
himself he stay first to inform susan that it wa rose who tie the
riband on daisi head then he stay a littl longer to let her into
the histori of the guinea-hen and to tell her who it wa that brought
the hen home from the abbey

rose held the siev and susan wa feed her long lost favourit
whilst philip lean over the wicket prolong hi narrat now my
pretti guinea-hen said susan--mi naughti guinea-hen that flew away
from me you shall never serv me so again i must cut your nice wings;
but i wont hurt you

take care cri philip; youd better inde youd better let me hold
her whilst you cut her wing

when thi oper wa success perform which it certainli could
never have been if philip had not held the hen for susan he recollect
that hi mother had sent him with a messag to mr price thi messag
led to anoth quarter of an hour delay; for he had the whole histori
of the guinea-hen to tell over again to mr price and the farmer
himself luckili came in whilst it wa go on so it wa but civil to
begin it afresh; and then the farmer wa so rejoic to see hi susan so
happi again with her two littl favourit that he declar he must see
daisi fed himself; and philip found that he wa want to hold the jug
full of milk out of which farmer price fill the pan for daisy? happi
daisy! who lap at hi eas whilst susan caress him and thank her
fond father and her pleas mother

but philip said mr price ill hold the jug--youl be late with
your messag to your mother; well not detain you ani longer

philip depart and as he went out of the garden-wicket he look up
and saw bab and her maid betti stare out of the window as usual on
thi he immedi turn back to tri whether he had shut the gate
fast lest the guinea-hen might stray out and fall again into the hand
of the enemi

miss barbara in the cours of thi day felt consider mortif
but no contrit she wa vex that her mean wa discov but
she felt no desir to cure herself of ani of her fault the ball wa
still uppermost in her vain selfish soul well said she to her
confidant betti you hear how thing have turn out; but if miss
somer wont think of ask me to go out with her ive a notion i know
who will as papa say it a good thing to have two string to one
bow

now some offic who were quarter at shrewsburi had becom
acquaint with mr case they had gotten into some quarrel with a
tradesman of the town and attorney case had promis to bring them
through the affair as the man threaten to take the law of them upon
the faith of thi promis and with the vain hope that by civil they
might dispos him to bring in a reason bill of cost these offic
sometim invit mr case to the mess; and one of them who had late
been marri prevail upon hi bride sometim to take a littl notic
of miss barbara it wa with thi ladi that miss barbara now hope to go
to the harper ball

the offic and mr strathspey or more properli mr strathspey and
the offic are to breakfast here tomorrow do you know said bab to
betti one of them dine at the abbey to-day and told papa that
theyd all come they are go out on a parti somewher into the
countri and breakfast here on their way pray betti dont forget that
mr strathspey cant breakfast without honey i heard her say so
myself

then inde said betti im afraid mr strathspey will be like to
go without her breakfast here; for not a spoon of honey have we let
her long for it ever so much

but sure said bab we can contriv to get some honey in the
neighbourhood

there none to be bought as i know of said betti

but is there none to be beg or borrowed? said bab laugh do
you forget susan beehive? step over to her in the morn with my
compliment and see what you can do tell her it for mr
strathspey

in the morn betti went with miss barbara compliment to susan to
beg some honey for mr strathspey who could not breakfast without it
susan did not like to part with her honey becaus her mother love it
and she therefor gave betti but a small quantiti when barbara saw how
littl susan sent she call her a miser and she said she must have
some more for mr strathspey ill go myself and speak to her come
with me betti said the young ladi who found it at present conveni
to forget her have declar the day that she suck up the broth that
she never would honour susan with anoth visit susan said she
accost the poor girl whom she had done everyth in her power to
injur i must beg a littl more honey from you for mr strathspey
breakfast you know on a particular occas such as thi neighbour
must help one anoth

to be sure they should ad betti

susan though she wa gener wa not weak; she wa will to give to
those she love but not dispos to let anyth be taken from her or
coax out of her by those she had reason to despis she civilli
answer that she wa sorri she had no more honey to spare

barbara grew angri and lost all command of herself when she saw that
susan without regard her reproach went on look through the
glass pane in the beehiv ill tell you what susan price said she
in a high tone the honey i will have so you may as well give it to me
by fair mean ye or no! speak! will you give it me or not? will you
give me that piec of the honey-comb that lie there?

that bit of honey-comb is for my mother breakfast said susan; i
cannot give it you

cant you? said bab then see if i dont take it! she stretch
across susan for the honey-comb which wa lie by some rosemari leav
that susan had freshli gather for her mother tea bab grasp but
at her first effort she onli reach the rosemari she made a second
dart at the honey-comb and in her struggl to obtain it she overset
the beehiv the bee swarm about her her maid betti scream and
ran away susan who wa shelter by a laburnum tree call to
barbara upon whom the black cluster of bee were now settl and
beg her to stand still and not to beat them away if you stand
quietli you wont be stung perhap but instead of stand quietli
bab buffet and stamp and roar and the bee stung her terribl
her arm and her face swell in a fright manner she wa help home
by poor susan and treacher mr betti who now the mischief wa done
thought onli of exculp herself to her master

inde miss barbara said she thi wa quit wrong of you to go and
get yourself into such a scrape i shall be turn away for it youll
see

i dont care whether you are turn away or not said barbara; i never
felt such pain in my life cant you do someth for me? i dont mind
the pain either so much as be such a fright pray how am i to be fit
to be seen at breakfast by mr strathspey; and i suppos i cant go to
the ball either to-morrow after all!

no that you cant expect to do inde said betti the comfort
you need not think of balls; for those lump and swell wont go off
your face thi week that not what pain me; but im think of what
your papa will say to me when he see you miss

whilst thi amiabl mistress and maid were in their advers revil
one anoth susan when she saw that she could be of no further use wa
prepar to depart but at the house-door she wa met by mr case mr
case had revolv thing in hi mind; for hi second visit at the abbey
pleas him as littl as hi first owe to a few word which sir arthur
and miss somer drop in speak of susan and farmer price mr case
began to fear that he had mistaken hi game in quarrel with thi
famili the refus of hi present dwelt upon the attorney mind; and
he wa awar that if the histori of susan lamb ever reach the abbey
he wa undon he now thought that the most prudent cours he could
possibl follow would be to hush up matter with the price with all
conveni speed consequ when he met susan at hi door he forc
a graciou smile how is your mother susan? said he is there
anyth in our hous can be of servic to her? on hear hi daughter
he cri out barbara barbara--bab! come downstair child and speak
to susan price but as no barbara answer her father stalk upstair
directli open the door and stood amaz at the spectacl of her
swell visag

betti instantli began to tell the stori of barbara mishap her own way
bab contradict her as fast as she spoke the attorney turn the maid
away on the spot; and partli with real anger and partli with feign
affect of anger he demand from hi daughter how she dare to
treat susan price so ill when as he said she wa so neighbourli and
oblig as to give you some of her honey? couldnt you be content
without seiz upon the honey-comb by force? thi is scandal
behaviour and what i assur you i cant counten

susan now interced for barbara; and the attorney soften hi voic
said that susan wa a great deal too good to her; as you are inde
ad he to everybodi i forgiv her for your sake susan curtsi
in great surprise; but her lamb could not be forgotten and she left the
attorney hous as soon as she could to make her mother rosemari tea
breakfast

mr case saw that susan wa not so simpl as to be taken in by a few fair
word hi next attempt wa to concili farmer price the farmer wa
a blunt honest man and hi counten remain inflex
contemptu when the attorney address him in hi softest tone

so stood matter the day of the long expect harper ball miss
barbara case stung by susan bee could not after all her manoeuvr
go with mr strathspey to the ball the ballroom wa fill earli in
the even there wa a numer assembl the harper who contend
for the prize were place under the music-galleri at the lower end of
the room amongst them wa our old blind friend who as he wa not so
well clad as hi competitor seem to be disdain by mani of the
spectat six ladi and six gentlemen were now appoint to be judg
of the perform they were seat in a semicircl opposit to the
harper the miss somers who were fond of music were amongst the
ladi in the semicircle; and the prize wa lodg in the hand of sir
arthur there wa now silenc the first harp sound and as each
musician tri hi skill the audienc seem to think that each deserv
the prize the old blind man wa the last he tune hi instrument; and
such a simpl pathet strain wa heard as touch everi heart all
were fix in delight attention; and when the music ceas the silenc
for some moment continu

the silenc wa follow by a univers buzz of applaus the judg
were unanim in their opinion and it wa declar that the old blind
harper who play the last deserv the prize

the simpl pathet air which won the suffrag of the whole assembl
wa hi own composit he wa press to give the word belong to
the music; and at last he modestli offer to repeat them as he could
not see to write miss somer readi pencil wa instantli produced; and
the old harper dictat the word of hi ballad which he called--
susan lament for her lamb

miss somer look at her brother from time to time as she wrote; and
sir arthur as soon as the old man had finish took him asid and
ask him some question which brought the whole histori of susan lamb
and of attorney case cruelti to light

the attorney himself wa present when the harper began to dictat hi
ballad hi colour as sir arthur steadili look at him vari
continually; till at length when he heard the word susan lament
for her lamb he suddenli shrunk back skulk through the crowd and
disappear we shall not follow him; we had rather follow our old
friend the victori harper

no sooner had he receiv the ten guinea hi well merit prize than
he retir to a small room belong to the peopl of the hous ask
for pen ink and paper and dictat in a low voic to hi boy who wa
a toler good scribe a letter which he order him to put directli
into the shrewsburi post-offic the boy ran with the letter to the
post-offic he wa but just in time for the postman horn wa
sound

the next morn when farmer price hi wife and susan were sit
togeth reflect that hi week leav of absenc wa nearli at an
end and that the money wa not yet made up for john simpson the
substitut a knock wa heard at the door and the person who usual
deliv the letter in the villag put a letter into susan hand
say a penni if you please--her a letter for your father

for me! said farmer price; here the penni then but who can it be
from i wonder? who can think of write to me in thi world? he tore
open the letter; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzl him-
-your oblig friend llewellyn

and what this? said he open a paper that wa inclos in the
letter it a song seemingly; it must be somebodi that ha a mind to
make an april fool of me

but it is not april it is may father said susan

well let us read the letter and we shall come to the truth all in good
time

farmer price sat down in hi own chair for he could not read entir to
hi satisfact in ani other and read as follows:--

my worthi friend--i am sure you will be glad to hear that i have had
good success thi night i have won the ten guinea prize and for that i

susan now by her father desir open the ballad he pick up the
five guinea bank note whilst she read with surpris susan
lament for her lamb her mother lean over her shoulder to read
the words; but they were interrupt befor they had finish the first
stanza by anoth knock at the door it wa not the postman with
anoth letter it wa sir arthur and hi sister

they came with an intent which they were much disappoint to find
that the old harper had render vain--they came to lend the farmer and
hi good famili the money to pay for hi substitut

but sinc we are here said sir arthur let me do my own busi
which i had like to have forgotten mr price will you come out with
me and let me show you a piec of your land through which i want to
make a road look there said sir arthur point to the spot i am
lay out a ride round my estat and that bit of land of your stop
me

whi sir said price the land mine to be sure for that matter;
but i hope you dont look upon me to be that sort of person that would be
stiff about a trifl or so

the fact is said sir arthur i had heard you were a litigi pig-
head fellow; but you do not seem to deserv thi charact

hope not sir said the farmer; but about the matter of the land i
dont want to take ani advantag of your wish for it you are welcom
to it; and i leav it to you to find me out anoth bit of land
conveni to me that will be worth neither more nor less; or els to
make up the valu to me some way or other i need say no more about it

i hear someth continu sir arthur after a short silence--i hear
someth mr price of a flaw in your leas i would not speak to you
about it whilst we were bargain about your land lest i should over-
awe you; but tell me what is thi flaw?

in truth and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all time
said the farmer i didnt know myself what a flaw as they call it
meant till i heard of the word from attorney case; and i take it a
flaw is neither more nor less than a mistak as one should say now by
reason a man doe not make a mistak on purpos it seem to me to be the
fair thing that if a man find out hi mistak he might set it right;
but attorney case say thi is not law; and ive no more to say the man
who drew up my leas made a mistake; and if i must suffer for it i
must said the farmer howev i can show you sir arthur just for
my own satisfact and your a few line of a memorandum on a slip of
paper which wa given me by your relat the gentleman who live here
befor and let me my farm youll see by that bit of paper what wa
meant; but the attorney say the paper not worth a button in a court
of justic and i dont understand these thing all i understand is the
common honesti of the matter ive no more to say

thi attorney whom you speak of so often said sir arthur you seem
to have some quarrel with now would you tell me frankli what is the
matter between--?

the matter between us then said price is a littl bit of ground
not worth much that is there open to the lane at the end of mr case
garden sir and he want to take it in now i told him my mind that
it belong to the parish and that i never would willingli give my
consent to hi crib it in that way sir i wa the more loath to see
it shut into hi garden which moreov is larg enough of all
conscienc without it becaus you must know sir arthur the children in
our villag are fond of make a littl play-green of it; and they have a
custom of meet on may day at a hawthorn that stand in the middl of
it and altogeth i wa veri loath to see em turn out of it by those
who have no right

let us go and see thi nook said sir arthur it is not far off is
it?

oh no sir just hard by here

when they got to the ground mr case who saw them walk togeth wa
in a hurri to join them that he might put a stop to ani explan
explan were thing of which he had a great dread; but fortun
he wa upon thi occas a littl too late

is thi the nook in dispute? said sir arthur

yes; thi is the whole thing said price

whi sir arthur interpos the polit attorney with an assum air
of generos dont let us talk ani more about it let it belong to
whom it will i give it up to you

so great a lawyer mr case as you are repli sir arthur must
know that a man cannot give up that to which he ha no legal title; and
in thi case it is imposs that with the best intent to oblig me
in the world you can give up thi bit of land to me becaus it is mine
alreadi as i can convinc you effectu by a map of the adjoin
land which i have fortun safe amongst my paper thi piec of
ground belong to the farm on the opposit side of the road and it wa
cut off when the lane wa made

veri possibl i daresay you are quit correct; you must know best
said the attorney trembl for the agenc

then said sir arthur mr price you will observ that i now promis
thi littl green to the children for a play-ground; and i hope they may
gather hawthorn mani a may day at thi their favourit bush mr price
bow low which he seldom did even when he receiv a favour himself
and now mr case said sir arthur turn to the attorney who did
not know which way to look you sent me a leas to look over

ye-ye-y stammer mr case i thought it my duti to do so; not out
of ani malic or ill-wil to thi good man

you have done him no injuri said sir arthur coolli i am readi to
make him a new leas whenev he pleas of hi farm and i shall be
guid by a memorandum of the origin bargain which he ha in hi
possess i hope i never shall take an unfair advantag of anyon

heaven forbid sir said the attorney sanctifi hi face that i
should suggest the take an unfair advantag of ani man rich or poor;
but to break a bad leas is not take an unfair advantag

you realli think so? said sir arthur

certainli i do and i hope i have not hazard your good opinion by
speak my mind concern the flaw so plainli i alway understood
that there could be noth ungentlemanlik in the way of busi in
take advantag of a flaw in a leas

now said sir arthur you have pronounc judgment undesignedli in
your own case you intend to send me thi poor man lease; but your
son by some mistak brought me your own and i have discov a fatal
error in it

a fatal error! said the alarm attorney

ye sir said sir arthur pull the leas out of hi pocket here
it is you will observ that it is neither sign nor seal by the
grantor

but you wont take advantag of me sure sir arthur? said mr case
forget hi own principl

i shall not take advantag of you as you would have taken of thi
honest man in both case i shall be guid by memoranda which i have in
my possess i shall not mr case defraud you of one shill of
your properti i am readi at a fair valuat to pay the exact valu
of your hous and land; but upon thi condition--that you quit the parish
within one month!

attorney case wa thu compel to submit to the hard necess of the
case for he knew that he could not legal resist inde he wa glad
to be let off so easily; and he bow and sneak away secretli
comfort himself with the hope that when they came to the valuat of
the hous and land he should be the gainer perhap of a few guinea
hi reput he justli held veri cheap

you are a scholar; you write a good hand; you can keep account cannot
you? said sir arthur to mr price as they walk home toward the
cottag i think i saw a bill of your littl daughter draw out the
other day which wa veri neatli written did you teach her to write?

no sir said price i cant say i did that; for she mostli taught it
herself but i taught her a littl arithmet as far as i knew on our
winter night when i had noth better to do

your daughter show that she ha been well taught said sir arthur;
and her good conduct and good charact speak strongli in favour of her
parent

judg of one anoth i want no agent to squeez my tenant or do my
dirti work i onli want a steadi intellig honest man like you to

well god bless your honour; ive no more to say but god bless your
honour said mr cox; and he walk away mutter to himself as he
slouch hi hat over hi face i hope ill live to be reveng on him!

mr somervil the next morn went with hi famili to look at the new
inn which he expect to see perfectli finished; but he wa met by the
carpent who with a rueful face inform him that six pane of glass
in the larg bow-window had been broken dure the night

ha! perhap mr cox ha broken my window in reveng for my refus to
let him my hous said mr somerville; and mani of the neighbour who
knew the malici charact of thi mr cox observ that thi wa like
one of hi trick a boy of about twelv year old howev step
forward and said i dont like mr cox im sure; for onc he beat me
when he wa drunk; but for all that no one should be accus
wrong he could not be the person that broke these window last
night for he wa six mile off he slept at hi cousin last night
and he ha not return home yet so i think he know noth of the
matter

mr somervil wa pleas with the honest simplic of thi boy and
observ that he look in eagerli at the staircas when the hous door
wa open he ask him whether he would like to go in and see the new
hous ye sir said the boy i should like to go up those stair
and to see what i should come to

up with you then! said mr somerville; and the boy ran up the stair
he went from room to room with great express of admir and
delight at length as he wa examin one of the garret he wa
startl by a flutter nois over hi head; and look up he saw a
white pigeon who frighten at hi appear began to fli round and
round the room till it found it way out of the door and flew into the
staircas

the carpent wa speak to mr somervil upon the landing-plac of
the stairs; but the moment he spi the white pigeon he broke off in
the midst of a speech about the nose of the stair and exclaim there
he is pleas your honour! there he that ha done all the damag to
our bow-window--that the veri same wick white pigeon that broke the
church window last sunday wa sennight; but he down for it now; we
have him safe and ill chop hi head off as he deserv thi minut

stay! o stay! dont chop hi head off: he doe not deserv it cri
the boy who came run out of the garret with the greatest eagerness--
_i_ broke your window sir said he to mr somervil i broke your
window with thi ball; but i did not know that i had done it till thi
moment i assur you or i should have told you befor dont chop hi
head off ad the boy to the carpent who had now the white pigeon
in hi hand

no said mr somervil the pigeon head shall not be chop off
nor your either my good boy for break a window i am persuad by
your open honest counten that you are speak the truth; but pray
explain thi matter to us; for you have not made it quit clear how
happen it that you could break my window without know it? and how
came you to find it out at last?

sir said the boy if youll come up here ill show you all i know
and how i came to know it

mr somervil follow the boy into the garret who point to a pane of
glass that wa broken in a small window that look out upon a piec of
wast ground behind the hous upon thi piec of wast ground the
children of the villag often use to play we were play there at
ball yesterday even continu the boy address himself to mr
somervil and one of the lad challeng me to hit a mark in the wall
which i did; but he said i did not hit it and bade me give him up my
ball as the forfeit thi i would not do; and when he began to wrestl
with me for it i threw the ball as i thought over the hous he ran
to look for it in the street but could not find it which i wa veri
glad of; but i wa veri sorri just now to find it myself lie upon thi
heap of shave sir under thi broken window; for as soon as i saw it
lie there i knew i must have been the person that broke the window;
and through thi window came the white pigeon here one of hi white
feather stick in the gap

ye said the carpent and in the bow-window room below there
plenti of hi feather to be seen; for ive just been down to look it
wa the pigeon broke them window sure enough

but he could not have got in had i not broke thi littl window said
the boy eagerly; and i am abl to earn sixpenc a day and ill pay for
all the mischief and welcom the white pigeon belong to a poor
neighbour a friend of our who is veri fond of him and i would not
have him kill for twice as much money

take the pigeon my honest gener lad said mr somervil and
carri him back to your neighbour i forgiv him all the mischief he ha
done me tell your friend for your sake as to the rest we can have
the window mended; and do you keep all the sixpenc you earn for
yourself

that what he never did yet said the carpent mani the sixpenc
he earn but not a halfpenni goe into hi own pocket: it goe everi
farth to hi poor father and mother happi for them to have such a
son!

more happi for him to have such a father and mother exclaim the boy
their good day they took all the best care of me that wa to be had for
love or money and would if i would let them go on pay for my
school now fall as they be in the world; but i must learn to mind
the shop now good morn to you sir; and thank you kindli said he
to mr somervil

and where doe thi boy live and who are hi father and mother? they
cannot live in town said mr somervil or i should have heard of
them

they are but just come into the town pleas your honour said the
carpent they live formerli upon counsellor odonnel estate; but
they were ruin pleas your honour by take a joint leas with a man
who fell afterward into bad compani ran out all he had so could not
pay the landlord; and these poor peopl were forc to pay hi share and
their own too which almost ruin them they were oblig to give up
the land; and now they have furnish a littl shop in thi town with
what good they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale
of their cattl and stock they have the good-wil of all who know them;
and i am sure i hope they will do well the boy is veri readi in the
shop though he said onli that he could earn sixpenc a day he write a
good hand and is quick at cast up account for hi age besid he
is like to do well in the world becaus he is never in idl compani
and ive known him sinc he wa two foot high and never heard of hi
tell a lie

thi is an excel charact of the boy inde said mr somervil
and from hi behaviour thi morn i am inclin to think that he
deserv all your prais

mr somervil resolv to inquir more fulli concern thi poor
famili and to attend to their conduct himself fulli determin to
assist them if he should find them such as they had been repres

in the meantim thi boy whose name wa brian oneil went to return
the white pigeon to it owner you have save it life said the woman
to whom it belong and ill make you a present of it brian thank
her; and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon he alway
took care to scatter some oat for it in hi father yard; and the
pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen and eat
off the same trencher with the dog

brian after the shop wa shut up at night use to amus himself with
read some littl book which the schoolmast who formerli taught him
arithmet wa so good as to lend him amongst these he one even met
with a littl book full of the histori of bird and beasts; he look
immedi to see whether the pigeon wa mention amongst the bird
and to hi great joy he found a full descript and histori of hi
favourit bird

so brian i see your school ha not been thrown away upon you; you
like your book i see when you have no master over you to bid you read
said hi father when he came in and saw brian read hi book veri
attent

thank you for have me taught to read father said brian here ive
made a great discovery: ive found out in thi book littl as it look
father a most curiou way of make a fortune; and i hope it will make
your fortun father; and if youll sit down ill tell it to you

mr oneil in hope of pleas hi son rather than in the expect
of have hi fortun made immedi sat down to listen; and hi son
explain to him that he had found in hi book an account of pigeon who
carri note and letters: and father continu brian i find my
pigeon is of thi sort; and i intend to make my pigeon carri messag
whi should not he? if other pigeon have done so befor him i think he
is as good and i daresay will be as easi to teach as ani pigeon in the
world i shall begin to teach him to-morrow morning; and then father
you know peopl often pay a great deal for send messengers; and no boy
can run no hors can gallop so fast as a bird can fly; therefor the
bird must be the best messeng and i should be paid the best price
hey father?

to be sure to be sure my boy said hi father laughing; i wish you
may make the best messeng in ireland of your pigeon; but all i beg my
dear boy is that you wont neglect our shop for your pigeon; for ive a
notion we have a better chanc of make a fortun by the shop than by
the white pigeon

brian never neglect the shop; but in hi leisur hour he amus
himself with train hi pigeon; and after much patienc he at last
succeed so well that one day he went to hi father and offer to send
him word by hi pigeon what beef wa a pound in the market of
ballynagrish where he wa go

the pigeon will be home long befor me father; and he will come in at
the kitchen window and light upon the dresser; then you must unti the
littl note which i shall have tie under hi left wing and youll know
the price of beef directli

the pigeon carri hi messag well; and brian wa much delight with
hi success he soon wa employ by the neighbour who were arous by
brian fond of hi swift messenger; and soon the fame of the white
pigeon wa spread amongst all who frequent the market and fair of
somervil

at one of these fair a set of men of desper fortun met to drink
and to concert plan of robberi their place of meet wa at the
ale-hous of mr cox the man who as our reader may rememb wa
offend by mr somervil hint that he wa fond of drink and of
quarrel and who threaten vengeanc for have been refus the new
inn

whilst these men were talk over their scheme one of them observ
that one of their companion wa not arriv anoth said no he
six mile off said another; and a third wish that he could make him
hear at that distanc thi turn the discours upon the difficulti
of send messag secretli and quickli cox son a lad of about
nineteen who wa one of thi gang mention the white carrier-pigeon
and he wa desir to tri all mean to get it into hi possess
accordingli the next day young cox went to brian oneil and tri at
first by persuas and afterward by threat to prevail upon him to
give up the pigeon brian wa resolut in hi refus more especi
when the petition began to bulli him

if we cant have it by fair mean we will by foul said cox; and a few
day afterward the pigeon wa gone brian search for it in vain--
inquir from all the neighbour if they had seen it and appli but to
no purpos to cox he swore that he knew noth about the matter but
thi wa fals for it wa he who dure the night-tim had stolen the
white pigeon he convey it to hi employ and they rejoic that
they had gotten it into their possess as they thought it would serv
them for a use messeng

noth can be more shortsight than cun the veri mean which
these peopl took to secur secreci were the mean of bring their
plot to light they endeavour to teach the pigeon which they had
stolen to carri messag for them in a part of the countri at some
distanc from somerville; and when they fanci that it had forgotten it
former habit and it old master they thought that they might ventur
to employ him nearer home the pigeon howev had a better memori than
they imagin they loos him from a bag near the town of ballynagrish
in hope that he would stop at the hous of cox cousin which wa on
it road between ballynagrish and somervil but the pigeon though he
had been purpos fed at thi hous for a week befor thi trial did
not stop there but flew on to hi old master hous in somervil and
peck at the kitchen window as he had formerli been taught to do hi
father fortun wa within hear and poor brian ran with the
greatest joy to open the window and to let him in

o father here my white pigeon come back of hi own accord
exclaim brian; i must run and show him to my mother at thi instant
the pigeon spread hi wing and brian discov under one of it wing
a small and veri dirti look billet he open it in hi father
presenc the scrawl wa scarc legible; but these word were at
length deciphered:--

thare are eight of uz sworn; i send yo at botom thare name we meat at
tin thi nite at my fader and have harm and all in radi to brak
into the grate ous mr summervil is to lye out to nite--kip the
pigeon until to-morrow for ever your murtagh cox jun

scarc had they finish read thi note than both father and son
exclaim let us go and show it to mr somervil befor they set
out they had howev the prudenc to secur the pigeon so that he
should not be seen by anyon but themselv mr somervil in
consequ of thi fortun discoveri took proper measur for the
apprehens of the eight men who had sworn to rob hi hous when they
were all safe lodg in the counti gaol he sent for brian oneil and
hi father; and after thank them for the servic they had done him he
count out ten bright guinea upon a tabl and push them toward
brian say i suppos you know that a reward of ten guinea wa
offer some week ago for the discoveri of john mac dermod one of the
eight men whom we have just taken up?

no sir said brian; i did not know it and i did not bring that note
to you to get ten guinea but becaus i thought it wa right i dont
want to be paid for do it

that my own boy said hi father we thank you sir; but well not
take the money; i dont like to take the price of blood

i know the differ my good friend said mr somervil between
vile inform and courag honest men

whi as to that pleas your honour though we are poor i hope we are
honest

and what is more said mr somervil i have a notion that you would
continu to be honest even if you were rich will you my good lad
continu mr somervil after a moment pause--wil you trust me with
your pigeon a few days?

o and welcom sir said the boy with a smile; and he brought the
pigeon to mr somervil when it wa dark and nobodi saw him

a few day afterward mr somervil call at oneil hous and bid
him and hi son follow him they follow till he stop opposit to
the bow-window of the new inn the carpent had just put up a sign

rosamond thought but she could not find out ani reason; besid she
suddenli recollect that she had not time to think ani longer; for there
wa a certain work-basket to be finish which she wa make for her
cousin bell as a present upon her birthday the work wa at a stand for
want of some filigree-pap and as her mother wa go out she ask
her to take her with her that she might buy some her sister laura went

turn back now it happen that the shop wa the corner hous of a
street and one of the window look out into a narrow lane a coach
full of ladi stop at the door just befor they went in so that no
one had time immedi to think of rosamond and her filigree-pap and
she went to the window where she saw her sister laura look earnestli
at someth that wa pass in the lane

opposit to the window at the door of a poor-look hous there wa
sit a littl girl weav lace her bobbin move as quick as
lightn and she never onc look up from her work is not she veri
industrious? said laura; and veri honest too? ad she in a minut
afterwards; for just then a baker with a basket of roll on hi head

she took it up eagerli look at it as if she wa veri hungri then put
asid her work and ran after the baker to return it to him whilst she
wa gone a footman in a liveri lace with silver who belong to the
coach that stood at the shop door as he wa loung with one of hi
companion chanc to spi the weav pillow which she had left upon a
stone befor the door to divert himself (for idl peopl do mischief
often to divert themselves) he took up the pillow and entangl all the
bobbin the littl girl came back out of breath to her work; but what
wa her surpris and sorrow to find it spoil she twist and
untwist place and replac the bobbin while the footman stood
laugh at her distress she got up gentli and wa retir into the
hous when the silver lace footman stop her say insol
sit still child

i must go to my mother sir said the child; besid you have spoil
all my lace i cant stay

cant you? said the brutal footman snatch her weaving-pillow again
ill teach you to complain of me and he broke off one after anoth
all the bobbin put them into hi pocket roll her weaving-pillow down
the dirti lane then jump up behind hi mistress coach and wa out of
sight in an instant

poor girl! exclaim rosamond no longer abl to restrain her
indign at thi injustice; poor littl girl!

at thi instant her mother said to rosamond--com now my dear if you
want thi filigre paper buy it

ye madam said rosamond; and the idea of what her godmoth and her
cousin bell would think of her generos rush again upon her
imagin all her feel of piti were immedi suppress
satisfi with bestow anoth exclam upon the poor littl girl!
she went to spend her half-guinea upon her filigre basket in the
meantim she that wa call the littl miser beckon to the poor
girl and open the window said point to the cushion is it

quite! quit spoiled! and i cant nor mother neither buy another; and
i cant do anyth els for my bread a few but veri few tear fell

how much would anoth cost? said laura

oh a great--great deal

more than that? said laura hold up her half-guinea

oh no

then you can buy anoth with that said laura drop the half-
guinea into her hand; and she shut the window befor the child could find
word to thank her but not befor she saw a look of joy and gratitud
which gave laura more pleasur probabl than all the prais which could
have been bestow upon her generos

late on the morn of her cousin birthday rosamond finish her work-
basket the carriag wa at the door--laura came run to call her;
her father voic wa heard at the same instant; so she wa oblig to
go down with her basket but half wrap up in silver paper--a
circumst at which she wa a good deal disconcerted; for the pleasur
of surpris bell would be utterli lost if one bit of the filigre
should peep out befor the proper time as the carriag went on
rosamond pull the paper to one side and to the other and by each of
the four corner

it will never do my dear said her father who had been watch her
oper i am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a
box which is twice as larg as itself

it is not a box father said rosamond a littl peevishly; it a
basket

let us look at thi basket said he take it out of her unwil
hand for she knew of what frail materi it wa made and she dread
it come to piec under her father examin he took hold of the
handl rather roughly; when start off the coach seat she cri oh
sir! father! sir! you will spoil it indeed! said she with increas
vehem when after draw asid the veil of silver paper she saw
him grasp the myrtl wreath handl inde sir you will spoil the
poor handl

but what is the use of the poor handl said her father if we are not
to take hold of it? and pray continu he turn the basket round
with hi finger and thumb rather in a disrespect manner pray is
thi the thing you have been about all thi week? i have seen you all
thi week dabbl with past and rags; i could not conceiv what you
were about is thi the thing?

ye sir you think then that i have wast my time becaus the
basket is of no use; but then it is a present for my cousin bell

your cousin bell will be veri much oblig to you for a present that is
of no use you had better have given her the purpl jar

oh father! i thought you had forgotten that--it wa two year ago; im
not so silli now but bell will like the basket i know though it is of
no use

then you think bell is sillier now than you were two year ago--wel
perhap that is true; but how come it rosamond now that you are so
wise that you are fond of such a silli person?

_i_ father? said rosamond hesit i dont think i am veri fond
of her

i did not say veri fond

well but i dont think i am at all fond of her

but you have spent a whole week in make thi thing for her

ye and all my half guinea besid

yet you think her silli and you are not fond of her at all; and you say
you know thi thing will be of no use to her

but it is her birthday sir; and i am sure she will expect someth
and everybodi els will give her someth

then your reason for give is becaus she expect you to give her
someth and will you or can you or should you alway give mere
becaus other expect or becaus somebodi els gives?

always?--no not alway

oh onli on birthday

rosamond laughing: now you are make a joke of me papa i see; but i
thought you like that peopl should be generous--mi godmoth said that
she did

so do i full as well as your godmother; but we have not yet quit
settl what it is to be gener

whi is it not gener to make presents? said rosamond

that is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to
answer but for instanc to make a present of a thing that you know
can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem becaus it is
her birthday and becaus everybodi give her someth and becaus she
expect someth and becaus your godmoth say she like that peopl
should be gener seem to me my dear rosamond to be sinc i must
say it rather more like folli than generos

rosamond look down upon the basket and wa silent then i am a fool
am i? said she look up at last

becaus you have made one mistake? no if you have sens enough to see
your own mistak and can afterward avoid them you will never be a
fool

here the carriag stop and rosamond recollect that the basket wa
uncov

now we must observ that rosamond father had not been too sever upon
bell when he call her a silli girl from her infanc she had been
humoured; and at eight year old she had the misfortun to be a spoil
child she wa idl fret and selfish; so that noth could make
her happi on her birthday she expect howev to be perfectli happi
everybodi in the hous tri to pleas her and they succeed so well
that between breakfast and dinner she had onli six fit of cri the
caus of five of these fit no one could discover: but the last and
most lament wa occas by a disappoint about a work muslin
frock; and accordingli at dress time her maid brought it to her
exclaim see here miss what your mamma ha sent you on your
birthday here a frock fit for a queen--if it had but lace round the
cuff

and whi ha not it lace around the cuffs? mamma said it should

ye but mistress wa disappoint about the lace; it is not come home

not come home indeed! and didnt they know it wa my birthday? but
then i say i wont wear it without the lace--i cant wear it without the
lace and i wont

the lace howev could not be had; and bell at length submit to let
the frock be put on

come miss bell dri your eye said the maid who educ her; dri
your eye and ill tell you someth that will pleas you

what then? said the child pout and sob

why--but you must not tell that i told you

no--but if i am asked?

whi if you are ask you must tell the truth to be sure so ill
hold my tongu miss

nay tell me though and ill never tell--if i am ask

well then said the maid your cousin rosamond is come and ha
brought you the most beautifullest thing you ever saw in your life; but
you are not to know anyth about it till after dinner becaus she
want to surpris you; and mistress ha put it into her wardrob till
after dinner

till after dinner! repeat bell impatiently; i cant wait till then;
i must see it thi minut the maid refus her sever time till
bell burst into anoth fit of cri and the maid fear that her
mistress would be angri with her if bell eye were red at dinner time
consent to show her the basket

how pretty!--but let me have it in my own hand said bell as the maid
held the basket up out of her reach

oh no you must not touch it; for if you should spoil it what would
becom of me?

becom of you indeed! exclaim the spoil child who never
consid anyth but her own immedi gratification--becom of you
indeed! what signifi that--i shant spoil it; and i will have it in my
own hand if you dont hold it down for me directli ill tell that you
show it to me

then you wont snatch it?

no no i wont inde said bell; but she had learn from her maid a
total disregard of truth she snatch the basket the moment it wa
within her reach a struggl ensu in which the handl and lid were
torn off and one of the medallion crush inward befor the littl
furi return to her sens

calm at thi sight the next question wa how she should conceal the
mischief which she had done after mani attempt the handl and lid
were replaced; the basket wa put exactli in the same spot in which it
had stood befor and the maid charg the child to look as if noth
wa the matter

we hope that both children and parent will here paus for a moment to
reflect the habit of tyranni mean and falsehood which children
acquir from live with bad servant are scarc ever conquer in the
whole cours of their futur live

after shut up the basket they left the room and in the adjoin
passag they found a poor girl wait with a small parcel in her hand
what your business? said the maid

i have brought home the lace madam that wa bespok for the young
ladi

oh you have have you at last? said bell; and pray whi didnt you
bring it sooner? the girl wa go to answer but the maid interrupt
her saying--com come none of your excuses; you are a littl idl
good-for-noth thing to disappoint miss bell upon her birthday but
now you have brought it let us look at it!

the littl girl gave the lace without repli and the maid desir her to
go about her busi and not to expect to be paid; for that her
mistress could not see anybodi becaus she wa in a room full of
compani

may i call again madam thi afternoon? said the child timidli

lord bless my stars! repli the maid what make peopl so poor i
wonders! i wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehous as i told
her and not of these folk call again! ye to be sure i believ
youd call call call twenti time for twopenc

howev ungraci the permiss to call again wa grant it wa
receiv with gratitud the littl girl depart with a cheer
countenance; and bell teaz her maid till she got her to sew the long
wished-for lace upon her cuff

unfortun bell!--al dinner time pass and peopl were so hungri so
busi or so stupid that not an eye observ her favourit piec of
fineri till at length she wa no longer abl to conceal her impati
and turn to laura who sat next to her she said you have no lace

your mamma could afford to give some like it? but you cant get ani if
she would for thi wa made on purpos for me on my birthday and nobodi
can get a bit more anywher if they would give the world for it

but cannot the person who made it said laura make ani more like it?

maid or her mother the mean pride which valu thing not for be
realli pretti or use but for be such as nobodi els can procur
nobodi can get ani like it i say repeat bell; nobodi in all london

anybodi but me i am sure mamma wont let her if i ask her not

veri well said laura coolli i do not want ani of it; you need not
be so violent: i assur you that i dont want ani of it

i know cri bell swell with disappoint vaniti it is pretti
for all that and it cost a great deal of money too and nobodi shall

smile the ill-suppress rage of the spoil child burst forth into the
seventh and loudest fit of cri which had yet been heard on her
birthday

what the matter bell ran roar to her mother; but no otherwis
explain the caus of her sorrow than by tear the fine lace with
frantic gestur from her cuff and throw the fragment into her
mother lap oh! the lace child!--ar you mad? said her mother
catch hold of both her hand your beauti lace my dear love--do

now to see me come nobodi would take me to be a landladi

landlord veri true inde wife--mr newington i mean--i ask pardon;
but now to go on with what we were say about the unposs of
let that old ladi and the civil-spoken young ladi there abov have
them there room for anoth day

landladi now mr newington let me hear no more about that old
gentlewoman and that civil-spoken young ladi fair word cost nothing;
and ive a notion that the caus they are so plenti with the young
ladi neither o them i take it by what theyv order sinc their
come into the hous are such grand folk that one need be so
petticular about them

landlord whi they came onli in a chais and pair to be sure; i cant
deni that

landladi but bless my stars! what signifi talking? dont you know
as well as i do mr newington that to-morrow is eton montem and that
if we had twenti time as mani room and as mani more to the back of

expect and those the highest qualiti of the land? nay what do i talk
of to-morrow? isnt my ladi piercefield and suit expected? and
moreov mr and miss bursal to be here and will call for as much in

abov that the dolphin room are not for them i must speak myself
though ti a thing i never do when i can help it

landlord (aside) she not like to speak! (aloud) my dear you can

speech that border on the uncivil order to a ladi like for the life

wheel mr wheeler!--captain wheeler if you pleas

landlord you captain wheeler! whi i thought in former time it wa
alway the oldest scholar at eton that wa captain at the montems; and
didnt mr talbot come afor you?

wheel not at all; we came on the same day some say i came first; some
say talbot so the choic of which of us is to be captain is to be put
to the vote amongst the lads--most vote carri it; and i have most vote
i fancy; so i shall be captain to-morrow and a pretti deal of salt* i
reckon i shall pocket whi the collect at the last montem they say
came to a plump thousand! no bad thing for a young fellow to set out
with for oxford or cambridge--hey?

*salt the cant name given by the eton lad to the money collect at
montem

landlord and no bad thing befor he set out for cambridg or oxford
twould be for a young gentleman to pay hi debt

wheel debts! oh time enough for that ive a littl account with you
in hors i know; but that between you and me you know--mum

landlord mum me no mum mr wheeler between you and me my best
hunter ha been ruinationed; and i cant afford to be mum so youll
take no offenc if i speak; and as youll set off to-morrow as soon as
the montem over youll be pleas to settl with me some way or other
to-day as weve no other time

wheel no time so proper certainli where the littl account?--i
have money sent me for my montem dress and i can squeez that much out
of it i came home from eton on purpos to settl with you but as to
the hunter you must call upon talbot--do you understand? to pay for him;
for though talbot and i had him the same day twa talbot did for him
and talbot must pay i spoke to him about it and charg him to
rememb you; for i never forget to speak a good word for my friend

landlord so i perceiv

wheel ill make bold just to give you my opinion of these jelli
whilst you are get my account mr newington

curtain fall



forgiv and forget

in the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of england there
live a garden who had one son call mauric to whom he wa veri
partial one day hi father sent him to the neighbour town to
purchas some garden seed for him when mauric got to the seed-shop
it wa full of peopl who were all impati to be served: first a
great tall man and next a great fat woman push befor him; and he
stood quietli besid the counter wait till somebodi should be at
leisur to attend to him at length when all the other peopl who were
in the shop had got what they want the shopman turn to maurice--and
what do you want my patient littl fellow? said he

i want all these seed for my father said mauric put a list of
seed into the shopman hand; and i have brought money to pay for them
all

the seedsman look out all the seed that mauric want and pack
them up in paper: he wa fold up some paint lady-pea when from a
door at the back of the shop there came in a squar rough-fac man
who exclaim the moment he came in are the seed i order ready?--
the wind fair--they ought to have been aboard yesterday and my china
jar is it pack up and directed? where is it?

it is up there on the shelf over your head sir answer the seedsman
it is veri safe you see; but we have not had time to pack it yet it
shall be done to-day; and we will get the seed readi for you sir
immedi

immediately! then stir about it the seed will not pack themselv up
make hast pray

immedi sir as soon as i have done up the parcel for thi littl
boy

what signifi the parcel for thi littl boy? he can wait and i
cannot--wind and tide wait for no man here my good lad take your
parcel and sheer off said the impati man; and as he spoke he took
up the parcel of seed from the counter as the shopman stoop to look
for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up

the parcel wa but loos fold up and as the impati man lift it
the weight of the pea which were withinsid of it burst the paper and
all the seed fell out upon the floor whilst mauric in vain held hi
hand to catch them the pea roll to all part of the shop; the
impati man swore at them but mauric without be out of humour
set about collect them as fast as possibl

whilst the boy wa busi in thi manner the man got what seed he
wanted; and as he wa talk about them a sailor came into the shop
and said captain the wind ha chang within these five minut and
it look as if we should have ugli weather

well im glad of it repli the rough face man who wa the captain
of a ship i am glad to have a day longer to stay ashor and ive
busi enough on my hand the captain push forward toward the
shop door mauric who wa kneel on the floor pick up hi seed
saw that the captain foot wa entangl in some packthread which hung
down from the shelf on which the china jar stood mauric saw that if
the captain took one more step forward he must pull the string so that
it would throw down the jar round the bottom of which the packthread wa
entangl he immedi caught hold of the captain leg and stop
him stay! stand still sir! said he or you will break your china
jar

the man stood still look and saw how the packthread had caught in hi
shoe buckl and how it wa near drag down hi beauti china jar
i am realli veri much oblig to you my littl fellow said he you
have save my jar which i would not have broken for ten guinea for it
is for my wife and ive brought it safe from abroad mani a leagu it
would have been a piti if i had broken it just when it wa safe land
i am realli much oblig to you my littl fellow thi wa return
good for evil i am sorri i threw down your seed as you are such a
good natur forgiv boy be so kind continu he turn to the
shopman as to reach down that china jar for me

the shopman lift down the jar veri care and the captain took off
the cover and pull out some tulip root you seem by the quantiti
of seed you have got to belong to a garden are you fond of
gardening? said he to mauric

ye sir repli mauric veri fond of it; for my father is a
garden and he let me help him at hi work and he ha given me a
littl garden of my own

then here are a coupl of tulip-root for you; and if you take care of
them ill promis you that you will have the finest tulip in england in
your littl garden these tulip were given to me by a dutch merchant
who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in holland
they will prosper with you im sure wind and weather permit

mauric thank the gentleman and return home eager to show hi
preciou tulip-root to hi father and to a companion of hi the son of
a nurseryman who live near him arthur wa the name of the
nurseryman son

the first thing mauric did after show hi tulip-root to hi father
wa to run to arthur garden in search of him their garden were
separ onli by a low wall of loos stones: arthur! arthur! where are
you? are you in your garden! i want you but arthur made no answer
and did not as usual come run to meet hi friend i know where
you are continu mauric and im come to you as fast as the
raspberry-bush will let me i have good news for you--someth youll
be delight to see arthur!--ha!--but here is someth that i am not
delight to see i am sure said poor mauric who when he had got
through the raspberry-bush and had come in sight of hi own garden
beheld hi bell-glass--hi belov bell-glass under which hi cucumb
were grown so finely--hi onli bell-glass broken to pieces!

i am sorri for it said arthur who stood lean upon hi spade in hi
own garden; i am afraid you will be veri angri with me

whi wa it you arthur broke my bell-glass! oh how could you do so?

i wa throw weed and rubbish over the wall and by accid a great
lump of couch-grass with stone hang to the root fell upon your
bell-glass and broke it as you see

mauric lift up the lump of couch-grass which had fallen through the
broken glass upon hi cucumb and he look at hi cucumb for a
moment in silence--oh my poor cucumbers! you must all die now i shall
see all your yellow flower wither tomorrow; but it is done and it
cannot be helped; so arthur let us say no more about it

you are veri good; i thought you would have been angri i am sure i
should have been exceedingli angri if you had broken the glass if it had
been mine

oh forgiv and forget as my father alway says; that the best way
look what i have got for you then he told arthur the stori of the
captain of the ship and the china jar; the seed have been thrown
down and of the fine tulip-root which had been given to him; and
mauric conclud by offer one of the preciou root to arthur who
thank him with great joy and repeatedli said how good you were not
to be angri with me for break your bell-glass! i am much more sorri
for it than if you had been in a passion with me!

arthur now went to plant hi tulip-root: and mauric look at the bed
which hi companion had been dig and at all the thing which were
come up in hi garden

i dont know how it is said arthur but you alway seem as glad to
see the thing in my garden come up and do well as if they were
all your own i am much happier sinc my father came to live here and
sinc you and i have been allow to work and to play togeth than i
ever wa before; for you must know befor we came to live here i had a
cousin in the hous with me who use to plagu me he wa not nearli so
good-natur as you are he never took pleasur in look at my garden
or at anyth that i did that wa well done; and he never gave me a
share of anyth that he had; and so i did not like him; how could i?
but i believ that hate peopl make us unhappy; for i know i never
wa happi when i wa quarrel with him; and i am alway happi with
you mauric you know we never quarrel

it would be well for all the world if they could be convinc like
arthur that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel it would
be well for all the world if they follow mauric maxim of forgiv
and forget when they receiv or when they imagin that they receiv
an injuri

arthur father mr oakli the nurseryman wa apt to take offenc at
trifles; and when he thought that ani of hi neighbour disoblig him
he wa too proud to ask them to explain their conduct; therefor he wa
often mistaken in hi judgment of them he thought that it show
spirit to rememb and to resent an injury; and therefor though he
wa not an ill-natur man he wa sometim led by thi mistaken idea
of spirit to do ill-natur things: a warm friend and a bitter enemi
wa one of hi maxim and he had mani more enemi than friend he wa
not veri rich but he wa proud; and hi favourit proverb wa better
live in spite than in piti

when first he settl near mr grant the garden he felt inclin to
dislik him becaus he wa told that mr grant wa a scotchman and he
had a prejudic against scotchmen; all of whom he believ to be cun
and avarici becaus he had onc been over-reach by a scotch
peddler grant friendli manner in some degre conquer thi
prepossess but still he secretli suspect that thi civil as he
said wa all show and that he wa not nor could not be a
scotchman be such a hearti friend as a true-born englishman

grant had some remark fine raspberri the fruit wa so larg as
to be quit a curios when it wa in season mani stranger came from
the neighbour town which wa a sea-bath place to look at these
raspberri which obtain the name of brobdingnag raspberri

how came you pray neighbour grant if a man may ask by these
wonder fine raspberries? said mr oakli one even to the
garden

that a secret repli grant with an arch smile

oh in case it a secret ive no more to say; for i never meddl with
ani man secret that he doe not choos to trust me with but i wish
neighbour grant you would put down that book you are alway pore
over some book or anoth when a man come to see you which is not
accord to my notion (be a plain unlarn englishman bred and
born) so civil and neighbourli as might be

mr grant hastili shut hi book but remark with a shrewd glanc at
hi son that it wa in that book he found hi brobdingnag raspberri

you are pleas to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as
book-larn as yourself mr grant; but i take it be onli a plain
spoken englishman as i observ afor that one is to the full as like
to find a raspberri in one garden as in one book mr grant

grant observ that hi neighbour spoke rather in a surli tone did not
contradict him; be well vers in the bibl he knew that a soft word
turneth away wrath and he answer in a good humour voic i hear
neighbour oakli you are like to make a great deal of money of your
nurseri thi year here to the health of you and your not forget
the seedl larch which i see are come on fine

thank ye neighbour kindly; the larch are come on toler well
that certain; and here to your good health mr grant--you and your
not forget your what dye call em raspberries--(drinks)--and after
a paus resum im not apt to be a beggar neighbour but if you
could give me--

here mr oakli wa interrupt by the entranc of some stranger and he
did finish make hi request--mr oakli wa not as he said of himself
apt to ask favour and noth but grant cordial could have
conquer hi prejudic so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a
scotchman he wa go to have ask for some of the brobdingnag
raspberry-pl the next day the thought of the raspberry-pl
recur to hi memori but be a bash man he did not like to go
himself on purpos to make hi request and he desir hi wife who wa
just set out to market to call at grant gate and if he wa at
work in hi garden to ask him for a few plant of hi raspberri

the answer which oakli wife brought to him wa that mr grant had not a
raspberry-pl in the world to give him and that if he had ever so
mani he would not give one away except to hi own son

oakli flew into a passion when he receiv such a messag declar it
wa just such a mean shabbi trick as might have been expect from a
scotchman--cal himself a boobi a dupe and a blockhead for ever
have trust to the civil speech of a scotchman--swor that he would
die in the parish workhous befor he would ever ask anoth favour be
it ever so small from a scotchman; relat to hi wife for the
hundredth time the way in which he had been taken in by the scotch
peddler ten year ago and conclud by forswear all further
intercours with mr grant and all belong to him

son arthur said he address himself to the boy who just then came
in from work--son arthur do you hear me? let me never again see you
with grant son

with mauric father?

with mauric grant i say; i forbid you from thi day and hour forward
to have anyth to do with him

oh whi dear father?

ask no question but do as i bid you

arthur burst out a cri and onli said ye father ill do as you
bid me to be sure

whi now what doe the boy cri for? is there no other boy simpleton
think you to play with but thi scotchman son! ill find out anoth
play-fellow for ye child if that be all

that not all father said arthur tri to stop himself from
sobbing; but the thing is i shall never have such anoth play-fellow-
-i shall never have such anoth friend as mauric grant

like father like son--you may think yourself well off to have done with
him

done with him! oh father and shall i never go again to work in hi
garden and may not he come to mine?

no repli oakli sturdily; hi father ha use me uncivil and no
man shall use me uncivil twice i say no wife sweep up thi hearth
boy dont take on like a fool; but eat thi bacon and green and let
hear no more of mauric grant

arthur promis to obey hi father he onli beg that he might onc
more speak to mauric and tell him that it wa by hi father order he
act thi request wa granted; but when arthur further beg to know
what reason he might give for thi separ hi father refus to tell
hi reason the two friend took leav of one anoth veri sorrow

mr grant when he heard of all thi endeavour to discov what could
have offend hi neighbour; but all explan wa prevent by the
obstin silenc of oakli

now the messag which grant realli sent about the brobdingnag
raspberri wa somewhat differ from that which mr oakli receiv
the messag wa that the raspberri were not mr grants; that
therefor he had no right to give them away; that they belong to hi
son mauric and that thi wa not the right time of year for plant
them thi messag had been unluckili misunderstood grant gave hi
answer to hi wife; she to a welsh servant-girl who did not perfectli
comprehend her mistress broad scotch; and she in her turn could not make
herself intellig to mr oakli who hate the welsh accent and whose
attent when the servant-girl deliv the messag wa princip
engross by the manag of her own hors the hors on which mr
oakli rode thi day be ill-broken would not stand still quietli at
the gate and she wa extrem impati to receiv her answer and to
ride on to market

oakli when he had onc resolv to dislik hi neighbour grant could
not long remain without find out fresh caus of complaint there wa
in grant garden a plum-tre which wa plant close to the loos stone
wall that divid the garden from the nurseri the soil in which the
plum tree wa plant happen not to be quit so good as that which wa
on the opposit side of the wall and the plum-tre had forc it way
through the wall and gradual had taken possess of the ground which
it like best

oakli thought the plum-tre as it belong to mr grant had no right to
make it appear on hi ground: an attorney told him that he might
oblig grant to cut it down; but mr grant refus to cut down hi plum-
tree at the attorney desir and the attorney persuad oakli to go to
law about the busi and the lawsuit went on for some month

the attorney at the end of thi time came to oakli with a demand for
money to carri on hi suit assur him that in a short time it would
be determin in hi favour oakli paid hi attorney ten golden guinea
remark that it wa a great sum for him to pay and that noth but the
love of justic could make him persever in thi lawsuit about a bit of
ground which after all said he is not worth twopenc the plum-
tree doe me littl or no damag but i dont like to be impos upon by
a scotchman

the attorney saw and took advantag of oakli prejudic against the
nativ of scotland; and he persuad him that to show the spirit of a
true-born englishman it wa necessari whatev it might cost him to
persist in thi law suit

it wa soon after thi convers with the attorney that mr oakli
walk with resolut step toward the plum-tre say to himself
if it cost me a hundr pound i will not let thi cun scotchman get
the better of me

arthur interrupt hi father reveri by point to a book and some
young plant which lay upon the wall i fanci father said he those
thing are for you for there is a littl note direct to you in
mauric handwrit shall i bring it to you?

ye let me read it child sinc i must it contain these words:

dear mr oakly--i dont know whi you have quarrel with us; i am veri
sorri for it but though you are angri with me i am not angri with you
i hope you will not refus some of my brobdingnag raspberry-pl which
you ask for a great while ago when we were all good friend it wa
not the right time of the year to plant them which wa the reason they
were not sent to you; but it is just the right time to plant them now;
and i send you the book in which you will find the reason whi we alway
put seawe ash about their roots; and i have got some seawe ash
for you you will find the ash in the flower-pot upon the wall i
have never spoken to arthur nor he to me sinc you bid us not so
wish your brobdingnag raspberri may turn out as well as our and
long to be all friend again i am with love to dear arthur and self
your affection neighbour son
mauric grant
ps--it is now about four month sinc the quarrel began and that is a
veri long while

a great part of the effect of thi letter wa lost upon oakli becaus he
wa not veri expert in read write and it cost him much troubl to
spell it and put it togeth howev he seem affect by it and
said i believ thi mauric love you well enough arthur and he seem
a good sort of boy; but as to the raspberri i believ all that he say
about them is but an excuse; and at anyr as i could not get em when
i ask for them ill not have em now do you hear me i say arthur?
what are you read there?

arthur wa read the page that wa doubl down in the book which
mauric had left along with the raspberry-pl upon the wall arthur
read aloud as follows:--

(monthli magazin dec 98 p 421)

there is a sort of strawberri cultiv at jersey which is almost
cover with seawe in the winter in like manner as mani plant in
england are with litter from the stabl these strawberri are usual
of the larg of a middle-s apricot and the flavour is
particularli grate in jersey and guernsey situat scarc one
degre farther south than cornwal all kind of fruit puls and
veget are produc in their season a fortnight or three week
sooner than in england even on the southern shores; and snow will
scarc remain twenty-four hour on the earth although thi may be
attribut to these island be surround with a salt and
consequ a moist atmospher yet the ash (seawe ashes) made use
of as manur may also have their portion of influence*

*it is necessari to observ that thi experi ha never been actual
tri upon raspberry-pl

and here continu arthur is someth written with a pencil on a
slip of paper and it is mauric write i will read it to you

when i read in thi book what is said about the strawberri grow as
larg as apricot after they had been cover over with seawe i
thought that perhap seawe ash might be good for my father
raspberries; and i ask him if he would give me leav to tri them he
gave me leav and i went directli and gather togeth some seawe
that had been cast on shore; and i dri it and burn it and then i
manur the raspberri with it and the year afterward the raspberri
grew to the size that you have seen now the reason i tell you thi is
first that you may know how to manag your raspberri and next
becaus i rememb you look veri grave as if you were not pleas with
my father mr grant when he told you that the way by which he came by
hi brobdingnag raspberri wa a secret perhap thi wa the thing
that ha made you so angri with us all; for you never have come to see
father sinc that even now i have told you all i know; and so i hope
you will not be angri with us ani longer

mr oakli wa much pleas by thi open and said whi now arthur
thi is someth like thi is tell one the thing one want to know
without fine speech thi is like an englishman more than a scotchman
pray arthur do you know whether your friend mauric wa born in england
or in scotland?

no inde sir i dont know--i never asked--i did not think it
signifi all i know is that wherev he wa born he is veri good
look papa my tulip is blow

upon my word said hi father thi will be a beauti tulip!

it wa given to me by mauric

and did you give him noth for it? wa the father inquiri

noth in the world; and he gave it to me just at the time when he had
good caus to be angri with me just when i had broken hi bell-glass

i have a great mind to let you play togeth again said arthur
father

oh if you would cri arthur clap hi hand how happi we
should be! do you know father i have often sat for an hour at a time
up in that crab-tre look at mauric at work in hi garden and
wish that i wa at work with him

here arthur wa interrupt by the attorney who came to ask mr oakli
some question about the lawsuit concern the plum-tre oakli show
him mauric letter; and to arthur extrem astonish the attorney
had no sooner read it than he exclaim what an art littl
gentleman thi is! i never in the cours of all my practic met with
anyth better whi thi is the most cun letter i ever read

where the cunning? said oakli and he put on hi spectacl

my good sir dont you see that all thi stuff about brobdingnag
raspberri is to ward off your suit about the plum-tree? they know--
that is mr grant who is sharp enough knows--that he will be worst
in that suit; that he must in short pay you a good round sum for
damag if it goe on--

damages! said oakli stare round him at the plum-tree; but i dont
know what you mean i mean noth but what honest i dont mean to
ask for ani good round sum; for the plum-tre ha done me no great harm
by come into my garden; but onli i dont choos it should come there
without my leav

well well said the attorney i understand all that; but what i want
to make you mr oakli understand is that thi grant and hi son onli
want to make up matter with you and prevent the thing come to a
fair trial by send on in thi underhand sort of way a bribe of a
few raspberri

a bribe! exclaim oakli i never took a bribe and i never will;
and with sudden indign he pull the raspberri plant from the
ground in which arthur wa plant them; and he threw them over the wall
into grant garden

mauric had put hi tulip which wa begin to blow in a flower-pot
on the top of the wall in hope that hi friend arthur would see it from
day to day alas! he knew not in what a danger situat he had
place it one of hi own brobdingnag raspberry-pl swung by the
angri arm of oakli struck off the head of hi preciou tulip! arthur
who wa full of the thought of convinc hi father that the attorney
wa mistaken in hi judgment of poor mauric did not observ the fall of
the tulip

the next day when mauric saw hi raspberry-pl scatter upon the
ground and hi favourit tulip broken he wa in much astonish and
for some moment angry; but anger with him never last long he wa
convinc that all thi must be owe to some accid or mistak he
could not believ that anyon could be so malici as to injur him on
purpose--and even if they did all thi on purpos to vex me said he to
himself the best thing i can do is not to let it vex me forgiv and
forget thi temper of mind mauric wa more happi in enjoy than he
could have been made without it by the possess of all the tulip in
holland

tulip were at thi time thing of great consequ in the estim
of the countri sever mile round where mauric and arthur live there
wa a florist feast to be held at the neighbour town at which a
prize of a handsom set of gardening-tool wa to be given to the person
who could produc the finest flower of it kind a tulip wa the flower
which wa thought the finest the preced year and consequ number
of peopl afterward endeavour to procur tulip-root in hope of
obtain the prize thi year arthur tulip wa beauti as he
examin it from day to day and everi day thought it improv he
long to thank hi friend mauric for it; and he often mount into hi
crab-tre to look into mauric garden in hope of see hi tulip
also in full bloom and beauti he never could see it

the day of the florist feast arriv and oakli went with hi son and
the fine tulip to the place of meet it wa on a spaciou bowling-
green all the flower of variou sort were rang upon a terrac at
the upper end of the bowling-green; and amongst all thi gay varieti
the tulip which mauric had given to arthur appear conspicu
beauti to the owner of thi tulip the prize wa adjudged; and as
the handsom garden-tool were deliv to arthur he heard a well known
voic wish him joy he turn look about him and saw hi friend
mauric

but mauric where is your own tulip? said mr oakly; i thought
arthur you told me that he kept one for himself

so i did said maurice; but somebodi (i suppos by accident) broke
it

somebody! who? cri arthur and mr oakli at onc

somebodi who threw the raspberry-pl back again over the wall
repli mauric

that wa me--that somebodi wa me said oakli i scorn to deni it;
but i did not intend to break your tulip mauric

dear mauric said arthur--y know i may call him dear maurice--now
you are by papa; here are all the garden-tools; take them and welcom

not one of them said mauric draw back

offer them to the father--off them to mr grant whisper oakly;
hell take them ill answer for it

mr oakli wa mistaken: the father would not accept of the tool mr
oakli stood surprised--certainli said he to himself thi cannot be
such a miser as i took him for; and he walk immedi up to grant
and bluntli said to him mr grant your son ha behav veri handsom
to my son; and you seem to be glad of it

to be sure i am said grant

which continu oakli give me a better opinion of you than ever i
had before--i mean than ever i had sinc the day you sent me the shabbi
answer about those foolish what dye call em curs raspberri

what shabbi answer? said grant with surprise; and oakli repeat
exactli the messag which he received; and grant declar that he never
sent ani such messag he repeat exactli the answer which he realli
sent and oakli immedi stretch out hi hand to him say i
believ you: no more need be said im onli sorri i did not ask you
about thi four month ago; and so i should have done if you had not been
a scotchman till now i never rightli like a scotchman we may thank
thi good littl fellow continu he turn to mauric for our
come at last to a right understand there wa no hold out
against hi good natur im sure from the bottom of my heart im
sorri i broke hi tulip shake hand boys; im glad to see you arthur
look so happi again and hope mr grant will forgive--

oh forgiv and forget said grant and hi son at the same moment and
from thi time forward the two famili live in friendship with each
other

oakli laugh at hi own folli in have been persuad to go to law
about the plum-tree; and he in process of time so complet conquer
hi earli prejudic against scotchmen that he and grant becam partner
in busi mr grant book-larn and knowledg of arithmet he
found highli use to him; and he on hi side possess a great mani
activ good qualiti which becam servic to hi partner

the two boy rejoic in thi famili union; and arthur often declar
that they owe all their happi to mauric favourit maxim forgiv
and forget



wast not want not; or two string to your bow

mr gresham a bristol merchant who had by honour industri and
economi accumul a consider fortun retir from busi to a
new hous which he had built upon the down near clifton mr gresham
howev did not imagin that a new hous alon could make him happi he
did not propos to live in idl and extravagance; for such a life
would have been equal incompat with hi habit and hi principl
he wa fond of children; and as he had no son he determin to adopt
one of hi relat he had two nephew and he invit both of them to

unfortun imbib a notion that extravag wa the sign of a
gener disposit and economi of an avarici one

benjamin on the contrari had been taught habit of care and foresight
hi father had but a veri small fortun and wa anxiou that hi son
should earli learn that economi ensur independ and sometim put
it in the power of those who are not veri rich to be veri gener

the morn after these two boy arriv at their uncl they were eager
to see all the room in the hous mr gresham accompani them and
attend to their remark and exclam

word which were written in larg charact over the chimney-piec in
hi uncl spaciou kitchen--

contemptu tone; i think it look stingi to servants; and no
gentleman servant cook especi would like to have such a mean
motto alway stare them in the face ben who wa not so convers
as hi cousin in the way of cook and gentlemen servant made no
repli to these observ

mr gresham wa call away whilst hi nephew were look at the other
room in the hous some time afterward he heard their voic in the
hall

know which way to go

no sir noth answer hal in a careless tone like one who wa
well content with the state of habitu idl no sir nothing!
repli ben in a voic of lament

unpack those two parcel for me?

the two parcel were exactli alik both of them well tie up with good
whip cord ben took hi parcel to a tabl and after break off the
seal wax began care to examin the knot and then to unti it
hal stood still exactli in the spot where the parcel wa put into hi
hand and tri first at one corner and then at anoth to pull the
string off by forc i wish these peopl wouldnt tie up their parcel
so tight as if they were never to be undon cri he as he tug at
the cord; and he pull the knot closer instead of loosen it

ben! whi how did you get your undon man? what in your parcel?--i
wonder what is in mine! i wish i could get thi string off--i must cut
it

oh no said ben who now had undon the last knot of hi parcel and
who drew out the length of string with exult dont cut it hal--
look what a nice cord thi is and your is the same: it a piti to cut
it; wast not want not! you know

it is whip cord said ben

well whip cord! what signifi a bit of whip cord! you can get a bit of
whip cord twice as long as that for twopence; and who care for twopence!
not i for one! so here it goe cri hal draw out hi knife; and
he cut the cord precipit in sundri place

lads! have you undon the parcel for me? said mr gresham open the
parlour door as he spoke

ye sir cri hal; and he drag off hi half cut half entangl
string--her the parcel and here my parcel uncle; and here

thank you sir said ben: what an excel whip cord it is!

and you hal continu mr gresham you may keep your string too if
it will be of ani use to you

it will be of no use to me thank you sir said hal

no i am afraid not if thi be it said hi uncl take up the
jag knot remain of hal cord

a few day after thi mr gresham gave to each of hi nephew a new top

but how this? said hal; these top have no strings; what shall we do
for strings?

i have a string that will do veri well for mine said ben; and he
pull out of hi pocket the fine long smooth string which had tie up
the parcel with thi he soon set up hi top which spun admir well

oh how i wish i had but a string said hal what shall i do for a
string? ill tell you what i can use the string that goe round my
hat!

but then said ben what will you do for a hat-band?

ill manag to do without one said hal and he took the string of hi
hat for hi top it soon wa worn through and he split hi top by
drive the pea too tightli into it hi cousin ben let him set up hi
the next day; but hal wa not more fortun or more care when he
meddl with other peopl thing than when he manag hi own he had
scarc play half an hour befor he split it by drive the peg too
violent

ben bore thi misfortun with good humour come said he it cant be
helped; but give me the string becaus that may still be of use for
someth els

it happen some time afterward that a ladi who had been intim
acquaint with hal mother at bath--that is to say who had frequent
met her at the card-tabl dure the winter--now arriv at clifton she
wa inform by hi mother that hal wa at mr gresham and her son
who were friend of hi came to see him and invit him to spend the
next day with them

hal joy accept the invit he wa alway glad to go out to
dine becaus it gave him someth to do someth to think of or at
least someth to say besid thi he had been educ to think it
wa a fine thing to visit fine people; and ladi diana sweepstak (for
that wa the name of hi mother acquaintance) wa a veri fine ladi and
her two son intend to be veri great gentlemen he wa in a prodigi
hurri when these young gentlemen knock at hi uncl door the next
day; but just as he got to the hall door littl patti call to him from
the top of the stair and told him that he had drop hi pocket-
handkerchief

pick it up then and bring it to me quick cant you child cri
hal for ladi di son are wait for me?

littl patti did not know anyth about ladi di sons; but as she wa
veri good-natur and saw that her cousin hal wa for some reason or
other in a desper hurri she ran downstair as fast as she possibl
could toward the landing-plac where the handkerchief lay; but alas!
befor she reach the handkerchief she fell roll down a whole
flight of stair and when her fall wa at last stop by the landing-
place she did not cri out she writh as if she wa in great pain

where are you hurt my love? said mr gresham who came instantli on
hear the nois of someon fall downstair where are you hurt my
dear?

here papa said the littl girl touch her ankl which she had
decent cover with her gown i believ i am hurt here but not
much ad she tri to rise; onli it hurt me when i move

ill carri you; dont move then said her father and he took her up in
hi arm

my shoe! ive lost one of my shoe said she

ben look for it upon the stair and he found it stick in a loop of
whip cord which wa entangl round one of the bannist when thi
cord wa drawn forth it appear that it wa the veri same jag
entangl piec which hal had pull off hi parcel he had divert
himself with run up and downstair whip the bannist with it
as he thought he could convert it to no better use; and with hi usual
careless he at last left it hang just where he happen to throw
it when the dinner bell rang poor littl patti ankl wa terribl
strain and hal reproach himself for hi folli and would have
reproach himself longer perhap if ladi di sweepstak son had not
hurri him away

in the even patti could not run about as she use to do; but she sat
upon the sofa and she said that she did not feel the pain of her ankl
so much whilst ben wa so good as to play at jack straw with her

that right ben; never be asham of be good-natur to those who
are younger and weaker than yourself said hi uncl smile at see
him produc hi whip cord to indulg hi littl cousin with a game at
her favourit cat cradl i shall not think you one bit less manli
becaus i see you play at cat cradl with a littl child of six
year old

hal howev wa not precis of hi uncl opinion: for when he
return in the even and saw ben play with hi littl cousin he
could not help smile contemptu and ask if he had been play
at cat cradl all night in a heedless manner he made some inquiri
after patti sprain ankl and then he ran on to tell all the news he
had heard at ladi diana sweepstakes--new which he thought would make
him appear a person of vast import

do you know uncle--do you know ben said he--ther to be the most
famou do that ever were heard of upon the down here the first day
of next month which will be in a fortnight thank my stars! i wish the
fortnight wa over; i shall think of noth els i know till that
happi day comes!

mr gresham inquir whi the first of septemb wa to be so much happier
than ani other day in the year

whi repli hal ladi diana sweepstak you know is a famou rider
and archer and all that--

veri like said mr gresham soberly; but what then?

dear uncle! cri hal but you shall hear there to be a race upon
the down on the first of septemb and after the race there to be an
archeri meet for the ladi and ladi diana sweepstak is to be one
of them and after the ladi have done shooting--now ben come the
best part of it! we boy are to have our turn and ladi di is to give a
prize to the best marksman amongst us of a veri handsom bow and arrow!
do you know ive been practis alreadi and ill show you to-morrow
as soon as it come home the famou bow and arrow that ladi diana ha
given me; but perhap ad he with a scorn laugh you like a
cat cradl better than a bow and arrow

ben made no repli to thi taunt at the moment; but the next day when
hal new bow and arrow came home he convinc him that he knew how to
use it veri well

ben said hi uncl you seem to be a good marksman though you have
not boast of yourself ill give you a bow and arrow and perhap if
you practis you may make yourself an archer befor the first of
september; and in the meantim you will not wish the fortnight to be
over for you will have someth to do

oh sir interrupt hal but if you mean that ben should put in for
the prize he must have a uniform

whi must he? said mr gresham

whi sir becaus everybodi has--i mean everybodi that anybody; and
ladi diana wa talk about the uniform all dinner time and it
settl all about it except the buttons: the young sweepstak are to
get their made first for patterns--they are to be white face with
green and theyll look veri handsom im sure; and i shall write to
mamma to-night as ladi diana bid me about mine; and i shall tell her to
be sure to answer my letter without fail by return of post; and then
if mamma make no object which i know she wont becaus she never
think much about expens and all that--then i shall bespeak my uniform
and get it made by the same tailor that make for ladi diana and the
young sweepstak

merci upon us! said mr gresham who wa almost stun by the rapid
vocifer with which thi long speech about a uniform wa pronounc
i dont pretend to understand these thing ad he with an air of
simplicity; but we will inquir ben into the necess of the case;
and if it is necessary--or if you think it necessari that you shall
have a uniform--whi ill give you one

you uncle? will you indeed? exclaim hal with amaz paint in
hi counten well that the last thing in the world i should have
expected! you are not at all the sort of person i should have thought
would care about a uniform; and now i should have suppos youd have
thought it extravag to have a coat on purpos onli for one day; and
im sure ladi diana sweepstak thought as i do; for when i told her of
that motto over your kitchen chimney wast not want not she laugh
and said that i had better not talk to you about uniform and that my
mother wa the proper person to write to about my uniform: but ill tell
ladi diana uncl how good you are and how much she wa mistaken

take care how you do that said mr gresham: for perhap the ladi wa
not mistaken

nay did not you say just now you would give poor ben a uniform?

i said i would if he thought it necessari to have one

oh ill answer for it hell think it necessari said hal laugh
becaus it is necessari

allow him at least to judg for himself said mr gresham

my dear uncl but i assur you said hal earnestli there no
judg about the matter becaus realli upon my word ladi diana said
distinctli that her son were to have uniform white face with green
and a green and white cockad in their hat

may be so said mr gresham still with the same look of calm
simplicity; put on your hat boy and come with me i know a
gentleman whose son are to be at thi archeri meet and we will
inquir into all the particular from him then after we have seen him
(it is not eleven oclock yet) we shall have time enough to walk on to
bristol and choos the cloth for ben uniform if it is necessari

i cannot tell what to make of all he say whisper hal as he reach
down hi hat; do you think ben he mean to give you thi uniform or
not?

i think said ben that he mean to give me one if it is necessary;
or as he said if i think it is necessari

and that to be sure you will; wont you? or els youll be a great fool
i know after all ive told you how can anyon in the world know so
much about the matter as i who have dine with ladi diana sweepstak
but yesterday and heard all about it from begin to end? and as for
thi gentleman that we are go to im sure if he know anyth about
the matter hell say exactli the same as i do

we shall hear said ben with a degre of composur which hal could by
no mean comprehend when a uniform wa in question

the gentleman upon whom mr gresham call had three son who were all
to be at thi archeri meeting; and they unanim assur him in the
presenc of hal and ben that they had never thought of buy uniform
for thi grand occas and that amongst the number of their
acquaint they knew of but three boy whose friend intend to be at
such an unnecessari expens hal stood amaz

such are the varieti of opinion upon all the grand affair of life
said mr gresham look at hi nephew what amongst one set of
peopl you hear assert to be absolut necessari you will hear from
anoth set of peopl is quit unnecessari all that can be done my
dear boy in these difficult case is to judg for yourselv which
opinion and which peopl are the most reason

hal who had been more accustom to think of what wa fashion than
of what wa reason without at all consid the good sens of what
hi uncl said to him repli with childish petul inde sir i
dont know what other peopl think; but i onli know what ladi diana
sweepstak said the name of ladi diana sweepstak hal thought must
impress all present with respect; he wa highli astonish when as he
look round he saw a smile of contempt upon everyon countenance:
and he wa yet further bewild when he heard her spoken of as a veri
silli extravag ridicul woman whose opinion no prudent person
would ask upon ani subject and whose exampl wa to be shun instead
of be imit

ay my dear hal said hi uncl smile at hi look of amaz
these are some of the thing that young peopl must learn from
experi all the world do not agre in opinion about characters: you
will hear the same person admir in one compani and blame in another;
so that we must still come round to the same point judg for
yourself

hal thought were howev at present too full of the uniform to allow
hi judgment to act with perfect imparti as soon as their visit
wa over and all the time they walk down the hill from princ
build toward bristol he continu to repeat nearli the same
argument which he had formerli use respect necess the uniform
and ladi diana sweepstak to all thi mr gresham made no repli and
longer had the young gentleman expati upon the subject which had so
strongli seiz upon hi imagin had not hi sens been forcibl
assail at thi instant by the delici odour and tempt sight of
certain cake and jelli in a pastrycook shop oh uncl said he
as hi uncl wa go to turn the corner to pursu the road to bristol
look at those jellies! point to a confection shop i must buy
some of those good thing for i have got some halfpenc in my pocket

your have halfpenc in your pocket is an excel reason for eat
said mr gresham smile

but i realli am hungri said hal; you know uncl it is a good while
sinc breakfast

hi uncl who wa desir to see hi nephew act without restraint
that he might judg their charact bid them do as they pleas

come then ben if youv ani halfpenc in your pocket

im not hungri said ben

i suppos that mean that youv no halfpenc said hal laugh with
the look of superior which he had been taught to think the rich might
assum toward those who were convict either of poverti or economi

wast not want not said ben to himself contrari to hi cousin
surmis he happen to have two pennyworth of halfpenc actual in hi
pocket

at the veri moment hal step into the pastrycook shop a poor
industri man with a wooden leg who usual sweep the dirti corner
of the walk which turn at thi spot to the well held hi hat to ben
who after glanc hi eye at the petition well worn broom
instantli produc hi twopenc i wish i had more halfpenc for you
my good man said he; but ive onli twopenc

hal came out of mr millar the confection shop with a hat of
cake in hi hand mr millar dog wa sit on the flag befor the
door and he look up with a wist beg eye at hal who wa eat
a queen cake hal who wa wast even in hi good-natur threw a
whole queen cake to the dog who swallow it for a singl mouth

there goe twopenc in the form of a queen cake said mr gresham

hal next offer some of hi cake to hi uncl and cousin; but they
thank him and refus to eat ani becaus they said they were not
hungry; so he ate and ate as he walk along till at last he stop
and said thi bun tast so bad after the queen cake i cant bear
it! and he wa go to fling it from him into the river

oh it is a piti to wast that good bun; we may be glad of it yet said
ben; give it me rather than throw it away

whi i thought you said you were not hungri said hal

true i am not hungri now; but that is no reason whi i should never be
hungri again

well there is the cake for you take it; for it ha made me sick and
i dont care what becom of it

ben fold the refus bit of hi cousin bun in a piec of paper and
put it into hi pocket

im begin to be exceed tire or sick or someth said hal;
and as there is a stand of coach somewher hereabout had not we
better take a coach instead of walk all the way to bristol?

for a stout archer said mr gresham you are more easili tire than
one might have expect howev with all my heart let us take a
coach for ben ask me to show him the cathedr yesterday; and i
believ i should find it rather too much for me to walk so far though i
am not sick with eat good thing

the cathedral! said hal after he had been seat in the coach about a
quarter of an hour and had somewhat recov from hi sickness--th
cathedral! whi are we onli go to bristol to see the cathedral? i
thought we came out to see about a uniform

there wa a dul and melancholi kind of stupid in hal counten
as he pronounc these word like one waken from a dream which made
both hi uncl and hi cousin burst out a-laugh

whi said hal who wa now piqu im sure you did say uncl you
would go to mr hall to choos the cloth for the uniform

veri true and so i will said mr gresham; but we need not make a
whole morn work need we of look at a piec of cloth? cannot we
see a uniform and a cathedr both in one morning?

they went first to the cathedr hal head wa too full of the uniform
to take ani notic of the paint window which immedi caught ben
embarrass attent he look at the larg stain figur on the
gothic window and he observ their colour shadow on the floor and
wall

mr gresham who perceiv that he wa eager on all subject to gain
inform took thi opportun of tell him sever thing about
the lost art of paint on glass gothic arch etc which hal thought
extrem tiresom

come! come! we shall be late inde said hal; sure youv look
long enough ben at thi blue and red window

im onli think about these colour shadow said ben

i can show you when we go home ben said hi uncl an entertain
paper upon such shadows*

*vide priestley histori of vision chapter on colour shadow

hark! cri ben did you hear that noise? they all listened; and
they heard a bird sing in the cathedr

it our old robin sir said the lad who had open the cathedr door
for them

ye said mr gresham there he is boys--look--perch upon the
organ; he often sit there and sing whilst the organ is play

and continu the lad who show the cathedr he ha live here
these mani mani winter they say he is fifteen year old; and he is so
tame poor fellow! that if i had a bit of bread hed come down and feed
in my hand

ive a bit of bun here cri ben joy produc the remain of
the bun which hal but an hour befor would have thrown away pray let
us see the poor robin eat out of your hand

the lad crumbl the bun and call to the robin who flutter and
chirp and seem rejoic at the sight of the bread; but yet he did
not come down from hi pinnacl on the organ

he is afraid of us said ben; he is not use to eat befor stranger
i suppos

the show of it to stranger till she lost the use of her poor limb

said ben when they went out of the cathedr

they went into the house; it wa rather a hovel than a house; but poor
as it wa it wa as neat as miseri could make it the old woman wa
sit up in her wretch bed wind worsted; four meagr ill-
cloth pale children were all busi some of them stick pin in paper
for the pin-mak and other sort rag for the paper-mak

what a horrid place it is! said hal sighing; i did not know there
were such shock place in the world ive often seen terrible-
look tumble-down place as we drove through the town in mamma
carriage; but then i did not know who live in them; and i never saw the
insid of ani of them it is veri dread inde to think that peopl
are forc to live in thi way i wish mamma would send me some more
pocket-money that i might do someth for them i had half a crown;
but continu he feel in hi pocket im afraid i spent the last
shill of it thi morn upon those cake that made me sick i wish i
had my shill now id give it to these poor peopl

ben though he wa all thi time silent wa as sorri as hi talk
cousin for all these poor peopl but there wa some differ between
the sorrow of these two boy

hal after he wa again seat in the hackney-coach and had rattl
through the busi street of bristol for a few minut quit forgot the
spectacl of miseri which he had seen; and the gay shop in wine street
and the idea of hi green and white uniform wholli occupi hi
imagin

when hi uncl stop at the woollen-drap door

much oblig to you; but i would rather not have one i have a veri good
coat and i think it would be wast

well let me get out of the carriag and we will see about it said
mr gresham; perhap the sight of the beauti green and white cloth
and the epaulett (have you ever consid the epaulettes?) may tempt
you to chang your mind

oh no said ben laughing; i shall not chang my mind

the green cloth and the white cloth and the epaulett were produc
to hal infinit satisfact hi uncl took up a pen and calcul
for a few minutes; then show the back of the letter upon which he
wa write to hi nephew cast up these sum boy said he and
tell me whether i am right

ben do you do it said hal a littl embarrassed; i am not quick at
figur ben wa and he went over hi uncl calcul veri
expediti

ye sir quit right

then by thi calcul i find i could for less than half the money
your uniform would cost purchas for each of you boy a warm great-
coat which you will want i have a notion thi winter upon the down

oh sir said hal with an alarm look; but it is not winter yet; it
is not cold weather yet we shant want greatcoat yet

dont you rememb how cold we were hal the day befor yesterday in
that sharp wind when we were fli our kite upon the downs? and winter
will come though it is not come yet--i am sure i should like to have a
good warm great-coat veri much

mr gresham took six guinea out of hi purs and he place three of them
befor hal and three befor ben young gentlemen said he i believ
your uniform would come to about three guinea a piec now i will lay
out thi money for you just as you pleas hal what say you?

whi sir said hal a great-coat is a good thing to be sure; and
then after the great-coat as you said it would onli cost half as much
as the uniform there would be some money to spare would not there?

ye my dear about five-and-twenti shill

five-and-twenti shillings?--i could buy and do a great mani thing to
be sure with five-and-twenti shillings; but then the thing is i must
go without the uniform if i have the great-coat

certainli said hi uncl

ah! said hal sigh as he look at the epaulett uncl if you
would not be displeas if i choos the uniform--

i shall not be displeas at your choos whatev you like best said
mr gresham

well then thank you sir said hal; i think i had better have the
uniform becaus if i have not the uniform now directli it will be of
no use to me as the archeri meet is the week after next you know;
and as to the great-coat perhap between thi time and the veri cold
weather which perhap wont be till christma papa will buy a great-
coat for me; and ill ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give
away and she will perhap to all thi conclus condit
reason which depend upon the word perhap three time repeat
mr gresham made no reply; but he immedi bought the uniform for hal
and desir that it should be sent to ladi diana sweepstak son
tailor to be made up the measur of hal happi wa now complet

and how am i to lay out the three guinea for you ben? said mr

arrow you shall have but go on; how shall i dispos of these five-and-
twenti shill for you?

great black patch on hi eye

economi and generos were the best friend instead of be enemi
as some silli extravag peopl would have us think them choos the
poor blind boy coat my dear nephew and pay for it there no
occas for my prais you about the matter your best reward is in
your own mind child; and you want no other or im mistaken now jump
into the coach boy and let be off we shall be late im afraid
continu he as the coach drove on: but i must let you stop ben with

when they came to the hous mr gresham open the coach door and ben
jump out with hi parcel under hi arm

to see peopl made happi as well as you do

and so do i too said hal; let me come with you i almost wish my
uniform wa not gone to the tailor so i do and when he saw the look
of delight and gratitud with which the poor boy receiv the cloth
which ben gave him; and when he heard the mother and children thank him
he sigh and said well i hope mamma will give me some more pocket
money soon

upon hi return home howev the sight of the famou bow and arrow
which ladi diana sweepstak had sent him recal to hi imagin
all the joy of hi green and white uniform; and he no longer wish that
it had not been sent to the tailor

but i dont understand cousin hal said littl patti whi you call
thi bow a famou bow you say famou veri often; and i dont know
exactli what it means; a famou uniform--fam do i rememb you
said there are to be famou do the first of septemb upon the
down what doe famou mean?

oh whi famou means--now dont you know what famou means? it means-
-it is a word that peopl say--it is the fashion to say it--it means--it
mean famou patti laugh and said thi doe not explain it to
me

that not my fault everybodi but littl children i suppos
understand it; but there no explain those sort of word if you
dont take them at onc there to be famou do upon the down the
first of september; that is grand fine in short what doe it signifi
talk ani longer patti about the matter? give me my bow for i must
go out upon the down and practis

ben accompani him with the bow and the three arrow which hi uncl had
now given to him; and everi day these two boy went out upon the down
and practis shoot with indefatig persever where equal
pain are taken success is usual found to be pretti nearli equal our
two archer by constant practic becam expert marksmen; and befor the
day of trial they were so exactli match in point of dexter that it
wa scarc possibl to decid which wa superior

day is it? wa the first question that wa ask by hal and ben the
moment that they waken the sun shone bright but there wa a sharp
and high wind ha! said ben i shall be glad of my good great-coat

exult when he enter the breakfast-room how do you do? seem

to say your uniform make no differ in my opinion of you

even littl patti went on eat her breakfast much as usual and talk
of the pleasur of walk with her father to the down and of all the

princip object in anyon imagin but hi own

you desir me and perhap you will be so good if i am not
troublesom to lift me over the veri bad place where are no stepping-
stone my ankl is entir well and im glad of that or els i

gresham examin the work with a close and scrupul eye; but in my
opinion here is one stitch that is rather too long the white teeth are

oh papa ill take out that long tooth in a minut said patti
laughing; i did not think that you would observ it so soon

i would not have you trust to my blind said her father stroke
her head fondly; i observ everyth i observ for instanc that

hole in them said he spread hi finger

now is it not veri extraordinari said hal to himself that they
should go on so long talk about an old pair of glove without say
scarc a word about my new uniform? well the young sweepstak and
ladi diana will talk enough about it; that one comfort is not it time
to think of set out sir? said hal to hi uncl the compani you

and ladi diana hors i know were order to be at the door at ten

mr stephen the butler here interrupt the hurri young gentleman in
hi calcul there a poor lad sir below with a great black

word with the young gentlemen if you pleas i told him they were just

minut

but i suppos said hal with a sigh that stephen mistook when he

he ha no reason to want to see me

here he comes--oh ben he is dress in the new coat you gave him

he if youll be pleas to take em theyr better than they look for
they bound higher than your head i cut the cork round for the insid

they are nice ball indeed: we are much oblig to you said the boy
as they receiv them and they prove them immedi the ball
struck the floor with a delight sound and rebound higher than mr
gresham head littl patti clap her hand joy but now a
thunder doubl rap at the door wa heard

the master sweepstak sir said stephen are come for master hal
they say that all the young gentlemen who have archeri uniform are to
walk togeth in a bodi i think they say sir; and they are to parad
along the well walk they desir me to say sir with a drum and fife
and so up the hill by princ place and all to go upon the down
togeth to the place of meet i am not sure im right sir; for
both the young gentlemen spoke at onc and the wind is veri high at the
street door; so that i could not well make out all they said; but i
believ thi is the sens of it

ye ye said hal eagerli it all right i know that is just what
wa settl the day i dine at ladi dianas; and ladi diana and a great
parti of gentlemen are to ride--

well that is noth to the purpos interrupt mr gresham dont
keep these master sweepstak wait decide--do you choos to go with
them or with us?

sir--uncle--sir you know sinc all the uniform agre to go together-
-

hal ran downstair in such a hurri that he forgot hi bow and arrow
ben discov thi when he went to fetch hi own; and the lad from
bristol who had been order by mr gresham to eat hi breakfast befor
he proceed to redland chapel heard ben talk about hi cousin bow
and arrow i know said ben he will be sorri not to have hi bow
with him becaus here are the green knot tie to it to match hi
cockade: and he said that the boy were all to carri their bow as part
of the show

if youll give me leav sir said the poor bristol lad i shall have
plenti of time; and ill run down to the well walk after the young
gentleman and take him hi bow and arrow

will you? i shall be much oblig to you said ben; and away went the
boy with the bow that wa ornament with green riband

the public walk lead to the well wa full of compani the window of
all the hous in st vincent parad were crowd with well dress
ladi who were look out in expect of the archeri process
parti of gentlemen and ladi and a motley crowd of spectat were
seen move backward and forward under the rock on the opposit side
of the water a barg with colour streamer fli wa wait to
take up a parti who were go upon the water the bargemen rest upon
their oar and gaze with broad face of curios upon the busi scene
that appear upon the public walk

the archer and archeress were now drawn up on the flag under the
semicircular piazza just befor mr yearsley librari a littl band
of children who had been muster by ladi diana sweepstak spirit
exert close the process they were now all in readi the
drummer onli wait for her ladyship signal; and the archer corp
onli wait for her ladyship word of command to march

where are your bow and arrow my littl man? said her ladyship to hal
as she review her lilliputian regiment you cant march man without
your arms?

hal had despatch a messeng for hi forgotten bow but the messeng
return not he look from side to side in great distress--oh
there my bow come i declare! cri he; look i see the bow and the
riband look now between the tree charl sweepstak on the
hotwel walk; it is coming!

but youv kept us all wait a confound time said hi impati
friend

it is that good-natur poor fellow from bristol i protest that ha
brought it me; im sure i dont deserv it from him said hal to
himself when he saw the lad with the black patch on hi eye run
quit out of breath toward him with hi bow and arrow

fall back my good friend--fal back said the militari ladi as soon
as he had deliv the bow to hal; i mean stand out of the way for
your great patch cut no figur amongst us dont follow so close now
as if you belong to us pray

the poor boy had no ambit to partak the triumph; he fell back as soon
as he understood the mean of the ladi word the drum beat the
fife play the archer march the spectat admir hal step
proudli and felt as if the eye of the whole univers were upon hi
epaulett or upon the face of hi uniform; whilst all the time he
wa consid onli as part of a show

the walk appear much shorter than usual and he wa extrem sorri
that ladi diana when they were half-way up the hill lead to princ
place mount her hors becaus the road wa dirti and all the
gentlemen and ladi who accompani her follow her exampl

we can leav the children to walk you know said she to the gentleman
who help her to mount her hors i must call to some of them though
and leav order where they are to join

she beckoned: and hal who wa foremost and proud to show hi alacr
ran on to receiv her ladyship order now as we have befor
observ it wa a sharp and windi day; and though ladi diana sweepstak
wa actual speak to him and look at him he could not prevent
hi nose from want to be blowed: he pull out hi handkerchief and
out roll the new ball which had been given to him just befor he left
home and which accord to hi usual careless habit he had stuf
into hi pocket in hi hurri oh my new ball! cri he as he ran
after it as he stop to pick it up he let go hi hat which he had
hitherto held on with anxiou care; for the hat though it had a fine
green and white cockad had no band or string round it the string as
we may recollect our wast hero had use in spin hi top the
hat wa too larg for hi head without thi band; a sudden gust of wind
blew it off ladi diana hors start and rear she wa a famou
hors woman and sat him to the admir of all beholders; but there
wa a puddl of red clay and water in thi spot and her ladyship
uniform habit wa a suffer by the accid careless brat! said she
whi cant he keep hi hat upon hi head? in the meantim the wind
blew the hat down the hill and hal ran after it amidst the laughter of
hi kind friend the young sweepstak and the rest of the littl
regiment the hat wa lodg at length upon a bank hal pursu it:
he thought thi bank wa hard but alas! the moment he set hi foot upon
it the foot sank he tri to draw it back; hi other foot slip and
he fell prostrat in hi green and white uniform into the treacher
bed of red mud hi companion who had halt upon the top of the hill
stood laugh spectat of hi misfortun

it happen that the poor boy with the black patch upon hi eye who had
been order by ladi diana to fall back and to keep at a distanc
wa now come up the hill; and the moment he saw our fallen hero he
hasten to hi assist he drag poor hal who wa a deplor
spectacl out of the red mud the oblig mistress of a lodg hous
as soon as she understood that the young gentleman wa nephew to mr
gresham to whom she had formerli let her hous receiv hal cover as
he wa with dirt

the poor bristol lad hasten to mr gresham for clean stock and
shoe for hal he wa unwil to give up hi uniform: it wa rub
and rub and a spot here and there wa wash out; and he kept
continu repeating--when it dri it will all brush off--when it
dri it will all brush off wont it? but soon the fear of be too
late at the archeri meet began to balanc the dread of appear in
hi stain habiliments; and he now as anxious repeat whilst the
woman held the wet coat to the fire oh i shall be too late; inde i
shall be too late; make haste; it will never dry; hold it nearer--near
to the fire i shall lose my turn to shoot; oh give me the coat; i
dont mind how it is if i can but get it on

hold it nearer and nearer to the fire dri it quickli to be sure;
but it shrunk it also so that it wa no easi matter to get the coat on
again howev hal who did not see the red splash which in spite
of all these oper were too visibl upon hi shoulder and upon
the skirt of hi white coat behind wa pretti well satisfi to observ
that there wa not one spot upon the face nobodi said he will
take notic of my coat behind i daresay i think it look as smart
almost as ever!--and under thi persuas our young archer resum hi
bow--hi bow with green riband now no more!--and he pursu hi way to
the down

all hi companion were far out of sight i suppos said he to hi
friend with the black patch--i suppos my uncl and ben had left home
befor you went for the shoe and stock for me?

oh ye sir; the butler said they had been gone to the down a matter
of a good half-hour or more

hal trudg on as fast as he possibl could when he got upon the down
he saw number of carriag and crowd of peopl all go toward the
place of meet at the ostrich he press forward he wa at first
so much afraid of be late that he did not take notic of the mirth
hi motley appear excit in all behold at length he reach the
appoint spot there wa a great crowd of peopl in the midst he
heard ladi diana loud voic bet upon someon who wa just go to
shoot at the mark

so then the shoot is begun is it? said hal oh let me in! pray
let me into the circle! im one of the archers--i am indeed; dont you
see my green and white uniform?

your red and white uniform you mean said the man to whom he address
himself; and the peopl as they open a passag for him could not
refrain laugh at the mixtur of dirt and fineri which it exhibit
in vain when he got into the midst of the formid circl he look
to hi friend the young sweepstak for their counten and support
they were amongst the most unmerci of the laugher ladi diana also
seem more to enjoy than to piti hi confus

whi could you not keep your hat upon your head man? said she in her
masculin tone you have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit;
but ive escap rather better than you have dont stand there in the
middl of the circl or youll have an arrow in your eye just now ive
a notion

hal look round in search of better friend oh where my uncle?--
where ben? said he he wa in such confus that amongst the
number of face he could scarc distinguish one from another; but he
felt somebodi at thi moment pull hi elbow and to hi great relief he
heard the friendli voic and saw the good natur face of hi cousin
ben

come back; come behind these peopl said ben and put on my great-
coat; here it is for you

right glad wa hal to cover hi disgrac uniform with the rough great-
coat which he had formerli despis he pull the stain droop
cockad out of hi unfortun hat; and he wa now suffici recov
from hi vexat to give an intellig account of hi accid to hi
uncl and patti who anxious inquir what had detain him so long
and what had been the matter in the midst of the histori of hi
disast he wa just prove to patti that hi take the hatband to
spin hi top had noth to do with hi misfortun and he wa at the
same time endeavour to refut hi uncl opinion that the wast of
the whipcord that tie the parcel wa the origin caus of all hi
evil when he wa summon to tri hi skill with hi famou bow

my hand are benumbed; i can scarc feel said he rub them and
blow upon the end of hi finger

come come cri young sweepstak im within one inch of the mark;
wholl go nearer? i shall like to see shoot away hal; but first
understand our laws; we settl them befor you came upon the green you
are to have three shot with your own bow and your own arrows; and
nobodi to borrow or lend under pretenc of other bow be better or
wors or under ani pretenc do you hear hal?

thi young gentleman had good reason for be so strict in these law
as he had observ that none of hi companion had such an excel bow
as he had provid for himself some of the boy had forgotten to bring
more than one arrow with them and by hi cun regul that each
person should shoot with their own arrow mani had lost one or two of
their shot

you are a lucki fellow; you have your three arrow said young
sweepstak come we cant wait whilst you rub your finger man--
shoot away

hal wa rather surpris at the asper with which hi friend spoke he
littl knew how easili acquaint who call themselv friend can
chang when their interest come in the slightest degre in competit
with their friendship hurri by hi impati rival and with hi
hand so much benumb that he could scarc feel how to fix the arrow
in the string he drew the bow the arrow wa within a quarter of an
inch of master sweepstak mark which wa the nearest that had yet been
hit hal seiz hi second arrow if i have ani luck-- said he but
just as he pronounc the word luck and as he bent hi bow the string
broke in two and the bow fell from hi hand

there it all over with you! cri master sweepstak with a
triumphant laugh

here my bow for him and welcom said ben

no no sir said master sweepstak that is not fair; that against
the regul you may shoot with your own bow if you choos it or
you may not just as you think proper; but you must not lend it sir

it wa now ben turn to make hi trial hi first arrow wa not
success hi second wa exactli as near as hal first you have
but one more said master sweepstakes--now for it! ben befor he
ventur hi last arrow prudent examin the string of hi bow; and
as he pull it to tri it strength it crack master sweepstak
clap hi hand with loud exult and insult laughter but hi
laughter ceas when our provid hero calmli drew from hi pocket an
excel piec of whip cord

the everlast whip cord i declare! exclaim hal when he saw that
it wa the veri same that had tie up the parcel ye said ben as he
fasten it to hi bow i put it into my pocket to-day on purpos
becaus i thought i might happen to want it he drew hi bow the third
and last time

oh papa! cri littl patti as hi arrow hit the mark it the
nearest; is it not the nearest?

master sweepstak with anxieti examin the hit there could be no
doubt ben wa victorious! the bow the prize bow wa now deliv to
him; and hal as he look at the whip-cord exclaim how lucki thi
whip-cord ha been to you ben!

it is lucki perhap you mean that he took care of it said mr
gresham

ay said hal veri true; he might well say wast not want not it
is a good thing to have two string to one bow

chapter i

mr and mr montagu spent the summer of the year 1795 at clifton with
their son frederick and their two daughter sophia and mariann they
had taken much care of the educ of their children; nor were they
ever tempt by ani motiv of person conveni or temporari
amus to hazard the perman happi of their pupil

sensibl of the extrem import of earli impress and of the
power influenc of extern circumst in form the charact
and the manner they were now anxiou that the varieti of new idea and
new object which would strike the mind of their children should appear
in a just point of view

let children see and judg for themselv is often inconsider
said where children see onli a part they cannot judg of the whole; and
from the superfici view which they can have in short visit and
desultori convers they can form onli a fals estim of the
object of human happi a fals notion of the natur of societi and
fals opinion of charact

for the abov reason mr and mr montagu were particularli cautiou
in the choic of their acquaint as they were well awar that
whatev pass in convers befor children becam part of their
educ

when they came to clifton they wish to have a hous entir to
themselv but as they came late in the season almost all the lodg
hous were full and for a few week they were oblig to remain in a
hous where some of the apart were alreadi occupi

dure the first fortnight they scarc saw or heard anyth of one of
the famili who lodg on the same floor with them an elderli quaker
and hi sister bertha were their silent neighbour the bloom
complexion of the ladi had inde attract the attent of the
children as they caught a glimps of her face when she wa get into
her carriag to go out upon the down they could scarc believ that
she came to the well on account of her health

besid her bloom complexion the delic white of her garment had
struck them with admiration; and they observ that her brother care
guard her dress from the wheel of the carriag as he hand her in
from thi circumst and from the benevol counten of the old
gentleman they conclud that he wa veri fond of hi sister and that
they were certainli veri happi except that they never spoke and could
be seen onli for a moment

not so the maiden ladi who occupi the ground floor on the stair in
the passag at her window she wa continu visible; and she
appear to possess the art of be present in all these place at onc
her voic wa etern to be heard and it wa not particularli
melodi the veri first day she met mr montagu children on the
stair she stop to tell mariann that she wa a charm dear and a
charm littl dear; to kiss her to inquir her name and to inform her
that her own name wa mr theresa tattl a circumst of which
there wa littl danger of their long remain in ignorance; for in the
cours of one morn at least twenti singl and as mani doubl rap at
the door were succeed by vocifer of mr theresa tattl
servant! mr theresa tattl at home? mr theresa tattl not at
home!

no person at the well wa often at home and abroad than mr tattl
she had as she deem it the happi to have a most extens
acquaint resid at clifton she had for year kept a regist of
arriv she regularli consult the subscript to the circul
librari and the list at the ball and the pump-rooms: so that with a
memori unencumb with literatur and free from all domest care
she contriv to retain a most astonish and correct list of birth
death and marriag togeth with all the anecdot amus
instruct or scandal which are necessari to the convers of a
water drink place and essenti to the charact of a veri pleasant
woman

a veri pleasant woman mr tattl wa usual called; and consciou
of her accomplish she wa eager to introduc herself to the
acquaint of her new neighbours; have with her ordinari expedit
collect from their servant by mean of her own all that could be
known or rather all that could be told about them the name of
montagu at all event she knew wa a good name and justifi in
court the acquaint she court it first by nod and beck and
smile at mariann whenev she met her; and mariann who wa a veri
littl girl began present to nod and smile in return persuad that a
ladi who smile so much could not be ill-natur besid mr
theresa parlour door wa sometim left more than half open to afford
a view of a green parrot mariann sometim pass veri slowli by thi
door one morn it wa left quit wide open when she stop to say
pretti poll; and immedi mr tattl beg she would do her the
honour to walk in and see pretti poll at the same time take the
liberti to offer her a piec of ice plum-cak

the next day mr theresa tattl did herself the honour to wait upon mr
montagu to apolog for the liberti she taken in invit mr
montagu charm miss mariann into her apart to see pretti poll
and for the still greater liberti she had taken in offer her a piec
of plum-cake--inconsider creatur that she was!--which might possibl
have disagre with her and which certainli were liberti she never
should have been induc to take if she had not been unaccount
bewitch by miss mariann strike though highli flatter
resembl to a young gentleman (an officer) with whom she had danc
now nearli twelv year ago of the name of montagu a most respect
young man and of a most respect famili with which in a remot
degre she might presum to say she herself wa someway connect
have the honour to be nearli relat to the jones of merionethshir
who were cousin to the mainwar of bedfordshir who marri into the
famili of the griffith the eldest branch of which she understood had
the honour to be cousin-german to mr montague; on which account she had
been impati to pay a visit so like to be product of most
agreeabl consequ by the acquisit of an acquaint whose
societi must do her infinit honour

have thu happili accomplish her first visit there seem littl
probabl of escap mr tattl further acquaint in the
cours of the first week she onli hint to mr montagu that some
peopl thought hi system of educ rather odd; that she should be
oblig to him if he would some time or other when he had noth els
to do just sit down and make her understand hi notion that she might
have someth to say to her acquaint as she alway wish to have
when she heard ani friend attack or ani friend opinion

mr montagu declin to sit down and make thi ladi understand a system
of educ onli to give her someth to say and show unaccount
indiffer about the attack with which he wa threaten mr tattl
next address herself to mr montagu prophesi in a most seriou
whisper that the charm miss mariann would shortli and inevit
grow quit crook if she were not immedi provid with a back-
board a french dancing-mast and a pair of stock

thi alarm whisper could not howev have a perman effect upon
mr montagu understand becaus three day afterward mr
theresa upon the most anxiou inspect entir mistook the just and
natur proport of the hip and shoulder

thi danger vanish mr tattl present with a rueful length of
face and formal prefac hesit to assur mr montagu that she
wa greatli distress about her daughter sophy; that she wa convinc
her lung were affected; and that she certainli ought to drink the water
morn and evening; and abov all thing must keep one of the patirosa
lozeng constantli in her mouth and directli consult dr cardamum the
best physician in the world and the person she would send for herself
upon her death-bed; becaus to her certain knowledg he had recov a
young ladi a relat of her own after she had lost one whole globe* of
her lung

*lobe

the medic opinion of a ladi of so much anatom precis could not
have much weight neither wa thi univers advis more success in
an attempt to introduc a tutor to frederick who she apprehend must
want some one to perfect him in the latin and greek and dead languag
of which she observ it would be impertin for a woman to talk; onli
she might ventur to repeat what she had heard said by good author
that a compet of the dead tongu could be had nowher but at a
public school or els from a privat tutor who had been abroad (after
the advantag of a classic educ finish in one of the
universities) with a good family; without which introduct it wa idl
to think of reap solid advantag from ani continent tour; all which
requisit from person knowledg she could aver to be concentr in
the gentleman she had the honour to recommend as have been tutor to a
young nobleman who had now no further occas for him have
unfortun for himself and hi famili been kill in an untim
duel

all mr theresa tattl suggest be lost upon these stoical
parent her power were next tri upon the children and her success
soon becam appar on sophi inde she could not make ani
impress though she had expend on her some of her finest stroke of
flatteri sophi though veri desir of the approb of her friend
wa not veri desir of win the favour of stranger she wa about
thirteen--that danger age at which ill educ girl in their
anxieti to display their accomplish are apt to becom depend for
applaus upon the prais of everi idl visitor; when the habit not be
form and the attent be suddenli turn to dress and manner
girl are apt to affect and imit indiscrimin everyth that
they conceiv to be agreeabl

sophi whose tast had been cultiv at the same time with her power
of reason wa not liabl to fall into these error she found that
she could pleas those whom she wish to pleas without affect to be
anyth but what she realli was; and her friend listen to what she
said though she never repeat the sentiment or adopt the phrase
which she might easili have copi from the convers of those who
were older or more fashion than herself

thi word fashion mr theresa tattl knew had usual a great
effect even at thirteen; but she had not observ that it had much power
upon sophy; nor were her remark concern grace and manner much
attend to her mother had taught sophi that it wa best to let herself
alon and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquir
grimac which noth but the fashion of the moment can support and
which is alway detect and despis by peopl of real good sens and
polit

bless me! said mr tattl to herself if i had such a tall daughter
and so unform befor my eye from morn to night it would certainli
break my poor heart thank heaven i am not a mother! if i were miss
mariann for me!

miss mariann had heard so often from mr tattl that she wa veri
charm that she could not help believ it; and from be a veri
pleas unaffect littl girl she in a short time grew so conceit
that she could neither speak look nor be silent without imagin that
everybodi wa or ought to be look at her; and when mr theresa saw
that mr montagu look veri grave upon these occas she to repair
the ill she had done would say after prais mariann hair or her
eye oh but littl ladi should never think about their beauti you
know nobodi love anybodi for be handsom but for be good
peopl must think children are veri silli or els they can never have
reflect upon the natur of belief in their own mind if they imagin
that children will believ the word that are said to them by way of
moral when the counten manner and everi concomit circumst
tell them a differ tale children are excel physiognomists--they
quickli learn the univers languag of looks; and what is said of them
alway make a greater impress than what is said to them a truth of
which those prudent peopl sure cannot be awar who comfort themselv
and apolog to parent by say oh but i would not say so and so
to the child

mr theresa had seldom said to frederick montagu that he had a vast
deal of drolleri and wa a most incompar mimic; but she had said so
of him in whisper which magnifi the sound to hi imagin if not
to hi ear he wa a boy of much vivac and had consider
abilities; but hi appetit for vulgar prais had not yet been surfeit
even mr theresa tattl flatteri pleas him and he exert himself
for her entertain so much that he becam quit a buffoon instead of
observ charact and manner that he might judg of them and form
hi own he now watch everi person he saw that he might detect some
foibl or catch some singular in their gestur or pronunci
which he might success mimic

alarm by the rapid progress of these evil mr and mr montagu who
from the first day that they had been honour with mr tattl visit
had begun to look out for new lodg were now extrem impati to
decamp they were not peopl who from the weak fear of offend a
silli acquaint would hazard the happi of their famili they had
heard of a hous in the countri which wa like to suit them and they
determin to go directli to look at it as they were to be absent all
day they foresaw that their offici neighbour would probabl interfer
with their children they did not choos to exact ani promis from them
which they might be tempt to break and therefor they onli said at
part if mr theresa tattl should ask you to come to her do as you
think proper

scarc had mr montagu carriag got out of hear when a note wa
brought direct to frederick montagu junior esq which he
immedi open and read as follows:--

mr theresa tattl present her veri best compliment to the
entertain mr frederick montague; she hope he will have the chariti
to drink tea with her thi even and bring hi charm sister miss
mariann with him as mr theresa will be quit alon with a shock
headach and is sensibl her nerv are affected; and dr cardamum say
that (especi in mr t ts case) it is downright death to nervou
patient to be alon an instant she therefor trust mr frederick will
not refus to come and make her laugh mr theresa ha taken care to
provid a few macaroon for her littl favourit who said she wa
particularli fond of them the other day mr theresa hope they will
all come at six or befor not forget miss sophi if she will
condescend to be of the parti

at the first read of thi note the entertain mr frederick and
the charm miss mariann laugh heartili and look at sophi as if
they were afraid that she should think it possibl they could like such
gross flattery; but upon a second perus mariann observ that it
certainli wa veri good-natur of mr theresa to rememb the
macaroons; and frederick allow that it wa wrong to laugh at the poor
woman becaus she had the headach then twist the note in hi
finger he appeal to sophy:--

well sophi leav off draw for an instant said frederick and
tell us what answer can we send?

can!--w can send what answer we pleas

ye i know that said frederick i would refus if i could; but we
ought not to do anyth rude should we? so i think we might as well
go becaus we could not refus if we would i say

you have made such confus repli sophi between couldnt and
wouldnt and shouldnt that i cant understand you; sure they are
all differ thing

different! no cri frederick--could would should might and
ought are all the same thing in the latin grammar; all of em sign of
the potenti mood you know

sophi whose power of reason were not to be confound even by
quotat from the latin grammar look up soberli from her draw
and answer that veri like those word might be sign of the same
thing in the latin grammar but she believ that they meant perfectli
differ thing in real life

that just as peopl pleas said her sophist brother you know
word mean noth in themselv if i choos to call my hat my
cadwallad you would understand me just as well after i had onc
explain it to you that by cadwallad i meant thi black thing that i
put upon my head; cadwallad and hat would then be just the same thing
to you

then whi have two word for the same thing? said sophy; and what ha
thi to do with could and should? you want to prove--

i want to prove interrupt frederick that it not worth while to
disput for two hour about two word do keep to the point sophi and
dont disput with me

i wa not disput i wa reason

well reason or disput women have no busi to do either; for
how should they know how to chop logic like men?

at thi contemptu sarcasm upon her sex sophi colour rose

there! cri frederick exult now we shall see a philosopheress in
a passion; id give sixpenc half-pric for a harlequin entertain
to see sophi in a passion now mariann look at her brush dab so
fast in the water!

sophi who could not easili bear to be laugh at with some littl
indign said brother i wish--

there! there! cri frederick point to the colour which rose in her
cheek almost to her temples--rising! rising! rising! look at the
thermometer! blood heat! blood! fever heat! boil water heat!
mariann

then said sophi smile you should stand a littl farther off both
of you leav the thermomet to itself a littl while give it time to
cool it will come down to temper by the time you look again

oh brother! cri mariann she so good-humour dont teas her
ani more and dont draw head upon her paper and dont stretch her
india-rubb and dont let us dirti ani more of her brush see! the
side of her tumbler are all manner of colour

oh i onli mix red blue green and yellow to show you mariann
that all colour mix togeth make white but she is temper now
and i wont plagu her; she shall chop logic if she like it though she
is a woman

but that not fair brother said mariann to say woman in that
way im sure sophi found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa
show us yesterday long befor you did though you are a man

not long said frederick besid that wa onli a conjur trick

it wa veri ingeni though said marianne; and papa said so
besid she understood the rule of three which wa no conjur
trick better than you did though she is a woman; and she can reason
too mamma say

veri well let her reason away said the provok wit all i have to
say is that shell never be abl to make a pud

whi not pray brother? inquir sophi look up again veri grave

whi you know papa himself the other day at dinner said that the woman
who talk greek and latin as well as i do is a fool after all; and that
she had better have learn someth useful; and mr tattl said shed
answer for it she did not know how to make a pud

well! but i am not talk greek and latin am i?

no but you are draw and that the same thing

the same thing! oh frederick! said littl mariann laugh

you may laugh; but i say it is the same sort of thing women who are
alway draw and reason never know how to make pud mr
theresa tattl said so when i show her sophi beauti draw
yesterday

mr theresa tattl might say so repli sophi calmly; but i do not
perceiv the reason brother whi draw should prevent me from learn
how to make a pud

well i say youll never learn how to make a good pud

i have learn continu sophi who wa mix her colour to mix
such and such colour togeth to make the colour that i want; and whi
should i not be abl to learn to mix flour and butter and sugar and egg
togeth to produc the tast that i want

oh but mix will never do unless you know the quantiti like a
cook; and you would never learn the right quantiti

how did the cook learn them? cannot i learn them as she did?

ye but youd never do it exactli and mind the spoon right by the
recip like a cook

indeed! indeed! but she would cri mariann eagerly: and a great
deal more exactli for mamma ha taught her to weigh and measur thing
veri carefully: and when i wa ill she alway weigh the bark in
nice and drop my drop so carefully: better than the cook when
mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake onc i saw her spoon
and her ounc and her handfuls: she dash and splash without
mind exact or the recip or anyth im sure sophi would make
a much better pud if exact onli were want

well grant that she could make the best pud in the whole world
what doe that signify? i say she never would: so it come to the same
thing

never would! how can you tell that brother?

whi now look at her with her book and her draw and all thi
apparatu do you think she would ever jump up with all her niceti
too and put by all these thing to go down into the greasi kitchen and
plump up to the elbow in suet like a cook for a plum-pudding?

i need not plump up to the elbow brother said sophi smiling: nor
is it necessari that i should be a cook: but if it were necessari i
hope i should be abl to make a pud

ye ye cri mariann warmly; and she would jump up and put by
all her thing in a minut if it were necessari and run down stair and
up again like lightn or do anyth that wa ever so disagre to
her even about the suet with all her niceti brother i assur you as
she use to do anyth everyth for me when i wa ill last winter
oh brother she can do anything; and she could make the best plum-
pud in the whole world im sure in a minut if it were necessari



chapter ii

now brother said mariann

no mariann i can do no more im quit tire and i will do no

even in the midst of laughter and whilst the voic of flatteri yet

disgust with mr theresa

what a deep sigh wa there! said mr theresa; what can make you sigh
so bitterly? you who make everybodi els laugh oh such anoth sigh

mariann cri frederick do you rememb the man in the mask?

oh yes; inde you must not leav me without take something; and miss
mariann must have anoth macaroon i insist upon it said mr
theresa ring the bell it is not late and my man christoph will
bring up the cowslip-win in a minut

said mariann

oh! miss sophi ha her book and draw you know she never afraid
of be alon besid to-night it wa her own choic and as to your
papa and mamma they wont be home to-night im pretti sure; for a
gentleman who had it from their own author told me where they were
go which is further off than they think; but they did not consult me;
and i fanci theyll be oblig to sleep out; so you need not be in a
hurri about them well have candl

the door open just as mr tattl wa go to ring the bell again for
candl and the cowslip-win christopher! christopher! said mr
theresa who wa stand at the fire with her back to the door when it
open christopher! pray bring--do you hear? but no christoph
answered; and upon turn round mr tattl instead of christoph
beheld two littl black figur which stood perfectli still and silent
it wa so dark that their form could scarc be discern

in the name of heaven who and what may you be? speak i conjur you!
what are ye?

the chimney-sweep maam an pleas your ladyship

chimney-sweepers! repeat frederick and mariann burst out a-
laugh

chimney-sweepers! repeat mr theresa provok at the recollect
of her late solemn address to them chimney-sweepers! and could not you
say so a littl sooner? pray what bring you here gentlemen at thi
time of night?

the bell rang maam answer a squeak voic

the bell rang! ye for christoph the boy mad or drunk

maam said the tallest of the chimney-sweep who had not yet
spoken and who now began in a veri blunt manner; maam your brother
desir us to come up when the bell rang; so we did

my brother? i have no brother dunc said mr theresa

mr eden madam

ho ho! said mr tattl in a more complac tone the boy take me
for miss bertha eden i perceive; and flatter to be taken in the dark
by a chimney-sweep for a young and handsom ladi mr theresa laugh
and inform him that they had mistaken the room; and they must go up
anoth pair of stair and turn to the left

the chimney-sweep with the squeak voic bow thank her ladyship
for thi inform said good night to ye quality; and they both
move toward the door

stay said mr tattl whose curios wa excited; what can the
eden want with chimney-sweep at thi time o night i wonder?
christoph did you hear anyth about it? said the ladi to her
footman who wa now light the candl

upon my word maam said the servant i cant say; but ill step down
below and inquir i heard them talk about it in the kitchen; but i
onli got a word here and there for i wa hunt for the snuff-dish as
i knew it must be for candl when i heard the bell ring maam; so i
thought to find the snuff-dish befor i answer the bell for i knew it
must be for candl you rang but if you pleas ill step down now
maam and see about the chimney-sweep

ye step down do; and christoph bring up the cowslip-win and
some more macaroon for my littl mariann

mariann withdrew rather coldli from a kiss which mr tattl wa go
to give her; for she wa somewhat surpris at the familiar with which
thi ladi talk to her footman she had not been accustom to these
familiar in her father and mother and she did not like them

well said mr tattl to christoph who wa now return what is
the news?

maam the littl fellow with the squeak voic ha been tell me
the whole stori the other morn maam earli he and the other were
down the hill sweep in paradis row those chimney they say are
difficult; and the squar fellow maam the biggest of the two boy got
wedg in the chimney the other littl fellow wa up at the top at the
time and he heard the cry; but in hi fright and all he did not know
what to do maam; for he look about from the top of the chimney and
not a soul could he see stir but a few that he could not make attend
to hi screech; the boy within almost stifl too so he screech and
screech all he could; and by the greatest chanc in life maam old
mr eden wa just go down the hill to fetch hi morn walk

ay interrupt mr theresa friend ephraim is one of your earli
riser

well said mariann impati

so maam hear the screech he turn and see the sweep; and at onc
he understand the matter--

im sure he must have taken some time to understand it interpos mr
tattl for he the slowest creatur breath and the deafest in
compani go on christoph so the sweep did make him hear

so he say maam; and so the old gentleman went in and pull the boy
out of the chimney with much ado maam

bless me! exclaim mr theresa; but did old eden go up the chimney
himself after the boy wig and all?

whi maam said christoph with a look of great delight that wa
all as one as the veri dentic word i put to the boy myself when he
tell me hi stori but maam that wa what i couldnt get out of
him neither rightli for he is a churl--th big boy that wa stuck in
the chimney i mean; for when i put the question to him about the wig
laugh like he wouldnt take it laugh like at all; but would onli
make answer to us like a bear he save my life that all i know; and
thi over again maam to all the kitchen round that cross-quest
him but i find him stupid and ill-mann like for i offer him a
shill maam myself to tell about the wig; but he put it back in a
way that did not becom such as he to no ladi butler maam; whereupon
i turn to the slim fellow (and he smarter and more mannerli maam
with a tongu in hi head for hi betters) but he could not resolv me
my question either; for he wa up at the top of the chimney the best part
o the time: and when he came down mr eden had hi wig on but had hi
arm all bare and bloodi maam

poor mr eden! exclaim mariann

oh miss continu the servant and the chimney-sweep himself wa so
bruis and must have been kill

well well! but he aliv now; go on with your stori christoph
said mr t chimney-sweep get wedg in chimney everi day; it
part of their trade and it a happi thing when they come off with a few
bruises* to be sure ad she observ that both frederick and
mariann look displeas at thi speech to be sure if one may
believ thi stori there wa some real danger

*thi atroci practic is now happili supersed by the use of sweep
machin

real danger! ye inde said marianne; and im sure i think mr eden
wa veri good

certainli it wa a most commend action and quit providenti so
i shall take an opportun of say when i tell the stori in all
companies; and the boy may thank hi kind star im sure to the end of
hi day for such an escape--but pray christoph said she
persist in her convers with christoph who wa now lay the
cloth for supper pray which hous wa it in paradis row? where the
eagl or the miss roper lodge? or which?

it wa at my ladi battersbi maam

ha! ha! cri mr theresa i thought we should get to the bottom of
the affair at last thi is excellent! thi will make an admir
stori for my ladi battersbi the next time i see her these quaker are
so sly! old eden i know ha long want to obtain an introduct into
that house; and a charm charit expedi hit upon! my ladi
battersbi will enjoy thi of all thing



chapter iii

now continu mr theresa turn to frederick as soon as the
servant had left the room now mr frederick montagu i have a favour-
-such a favour--to ask of you; it a favour which onli you can grant;
you have such talent and would do the thing so admirably; and my ladi
battersbi would quit ador you for it she will do me the honour to be
here to spend an even to-morrow im convinc mr and mr montagu
will find themselv oblig to stay out anoth day and i so long to
show you off to her ladyship; and your doctor carbuncl and your
counsellor puff and your miss croker and all your charm charact
you must let me introduc you to her ladyship to-morrow even promis
me

oh maam said frederick i cannot promis you ani such thing
inde i am much oblig to you; but inde i cannot come

whi not my dear sir? whi not? you dont think i mean you should
promis if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home

if they do come home i will ask them about it said frederick
hesitating; for though he by no mean wish to accept the invit he
had not yet acquir the necessari power of decidedli say no

ask them! repeat mr theresa my dear sir at your age must you
ask your papa and mamma about such things?

must! no maam said frederick; but i said i would i know i need
not becaus my father and mother alway let me judg for myself almost
about everyth

and about thi i am sure cri mariann papa and mamma you know
just as they were go away said if mr theresa ask you to come do
as you think best

well then said mr theresa you know it rest with yourselv if
you may do as you pleas

to be sure i may madam said frederick colour from that speci of
emot which is justli call fals shame and which often conquer real
shame; to be sure maam i may do as i pleas

then i may make sure of you said mr theresa; for now it would be
downright rude to tell a ladi you wont do as she pleas mr
frederick montagu im sure is too wellbr a young gentleman to do so
unpolit so ungal a thing!

the jargon of polit and gallantri is frequent brought by the silli
acquaint of young peopl to confus their simpl moral and clear
good sens a new and unintellig system is present to them in a
languag foreign to their understand and contradictori to their
feel they hesit between new motiv and old principl from
the fear of be thought ignor they becom affected; and from the
dread of be thought to be children act like fool but all thi they
feel onli when they are in the compani of such peopl as mr theresa
tattl

maam frederick began i dont mean to be rude; but i hope youll
excus me from come to drink tea with you to-morrow becaus my father
and mother are not acquaint with ladi battersbi and mayb they might
not like--

take care take care said mr theresa laugh at hi perplexity:
you want to get off from oblig me and you dont know how you had
veri nearli made a most shock blunder in put it all upon poor ladi
battersbi now you know it imposs that mr and mr montagu could
have in natur the slightest object to introduc you to my ladi
battersbi at my own house; for dont you know that besid her
ladyship mani unquestion qualiti which one need not talk of she
is cousin but onc remov to the trotter of lancashire--your mother
great favourites? and there is not a person at the well ill ventur
to say could be of more advantag to your sister sophi in the way of
partner when she come to go the ball which it to be suppos she
will some time or other; and as you are so good a brother that a
thing to be look to you know besid as to yourself there
noth her ladyship delight in so much as in a good mimic; and shell
quit ador you!

but i dont want her to ador me maam said frederick bluntly; then
correct himself ad i mean for be a mimic

whi not my love? between friend can there be ani harm in show
one talents? you that have such talent to show shell keep your
secret ill answer for her; and ad she you neednt be afraid of
her criticism; for between you and me she no great critic; so youll
come well thank you that settl how you have made me beg and
pray! but you know your own valu i see; as you entertain peopl
alway do one must ask a wit like a fine singer so often well but
now for the favour i wa go to ask you

frederick look surprised; for he thought that the favour of hi compani
wa what she meant: but she explain herself farther

as to the old quaker who lodg abov old ephraim eden--mi ladi
battersbi and i have so much divers about him he is the best
charact the oddest creature! if you were but to see him come into the
room with those stiff skirt or walk with hi etern sister bertha
and hi everlast broad-brim hat! one know him a mile off! but
then hi voic and way and altogeth if one could get them to the
life theyd be better than anyth on the stage; better even than
anyth ive seen to-night; and i think youd make a capit quaker for
my ladi battersby; but then the thing is one can never get to hear the
old quiz talk now you who have so much invent and cleverness--i
have no invent myself; but could you not hit upon some way of see
him so that you might get him by heart? im sure you who are so quick
would onli want to see him and hear him for half a minut to be abl
to take him off so as to kill one with laugh but i have no
invent

oh as to the invent said frederick i know an admir way of
do the thing if that is all; but then rememb i dont say i will do
the thing for i will not but i know a way of get up into hi room
and see him without hi know me to be there

oh tell it me you charm clever creature!

but rememb i do not say i will do it

well well let us hear it; and you shall do as you pleas afterward
merci goodness! exclaim mr tattl do my ear deceiv me? i
declar i look round and thought i heard the squeak chimney-sweep
wa in the room!

so did i frederick i declar cri mariann laugh i never
heard anyth so like hi voic in my life

frederick imit the squeak voic of thi chimney-sweep to great
perfect

now continu he thi fellow is just my height the old quaker if
my face were blacken and if i were to chang cloth with the chimney-
sweeper ill answer for it would never know me

oh it an admir invention! i give you infinit credit for it!
exclaim mr theresa it shall it must be done ill ring and have
the fellow up thi minut

oh no; do not ring said frederick stop her hand i dont mean
to do it you know you promis that i should do as i pleas i onli
told you my invent

well well; but onli let me ring and ask whether the chimney-sweep
are below you shall do as you pleas afterward

christoph shut the door christoph said she to the servant who
came up when she rang pray are the sweep gone yet?

no maam

but have they been up to old eden yet?

oh no maam; nor be not to go till the bell rings; for miss bertha
maam wa asleep a-li down and her brother wouldnt have her waken
on no account whatsomev he came down hisself to the kitchen to the
sweep though; but wouldnt have as i heard him say hi sister wake
for no account but miss bertha bell will ring when she waken for the
sweep maam twa she want to see the boy as her brother save and
i suppos sent for him to give him someth charit maam

well never mind your supposit said mr theresa; run down thi
veri minut to the littl squeak chimney-sweep and send him up to me
quick but dont let the other bear come up with him

christoph who had curios as well as hi mistress when he return
with the chimney-sweep prolong hi own stay in the room by sweep
the hearth throw down the tong and shovel and pick them up
again

that will do christopher! christoph that will do i say mr
theresa repeat in vain she wa oblig to say christoph you may
go befor he would depart

now said she to frederick step in here to the next room with thi
candl and youll be equip in an instant onli just chang cloth
with the boy; onli just let me see what a charm chimney-sweep youd
make you shall do as you pleas afterward

well ill onli chang cloth with him just to show you for one
minut

but said mariann to mr theresa whilst frederick wa chang hi
cloth i think frederick is right about--

about what love?

i think he is in the right not to go up though he can do it so easili
to see that gentleman; i mean on purpos to mimic and laugh at him
afterward i dont think that would be quit right

whi pray miss marianne?

whi becaus he is so good-natur to hi sister he would not let her
be waken

dear it easi to be good in such littl things; and he wont have long
to be good to her neither; for i dont think she will troubl him long in
thi world anyhow

what do you mean? said mariann

that shell die child

die! die with that beauti colour in her cheeks! how sorri her poor
poor brother will be! but she will not die im sure for she walk
about and run upstair so lightly! oh you must be quit mistaken i
hope

if im mistaken dr panado cardamum mistaken too then that my
comfort he say unless the water work a miracl she stand a bad
chance; and she wont follow my advic and consult the doctor for her
health

he would frighten her to death perhap said mariann i hope
frederick wont go up to disturb her

lud child you are turn simpleton all of a sudden; how can your
brother disturb her more than the real chimney-sweeper?

but i dont think it right persist mariann and i shall tell him
so

nay miss mariann i dont commend you now young ladi should not be
so forward to give opinion and advic to their elder brother unasked;
and i presum that mr frederick and i must know what right as well as
miss mariann hush! here he is oh the capit figure! cri mr
theresa bravo bravo! cri she as frederick enter in the chimney-
sweeper dress; and as he spoke say im afraid pleas your
ladyship to dirt your ladyship carpet she broke out into immoder
raptur call him her charm chimney-sweeper! and repeat that
she knew beforehand the charact would do for him

mr theresa instantli rang the bell in spite of all expostulation--
order christoph to send up the other chimney-sweeper--triumph in
observ that christoph did not know frederick when he came into the
room; and offer to lay ani wager that the other chimney-sweep would
mistak him for hi companion and so he did; and when frederick spoke
the voic wa so veri like that it wa scarc possibl that he should
have perceiv the differ

mariann wa divert by thi scene; but she start when in the midst
of it they heard a bell ring

that the ladi bell and we must go said the blunt chimney-sweep

shill for you to drink my honest fellow i did not know you were so
much bruis when i first saw you i wont detain you go said she
push frederick toward the door mariann sprang forward to speak to

chimney-sweep hand who had all thi time stood in silence; you are
not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman

that more than he deserv im certain sure he might have known well
enough it wa mr frederick all the time and hed no busi to go to
fight--such a one as he--with a gentleman

opposit side of the hall to mr tattl here is a place said he

everybodi

nay my room at mr frederick montagu servic and my door open

sir i disguis myself in thi dress; i came up to your room to-night on
purpos to see you without your know it that i might mimic you the
chimney-sweep where is he? said frederick look round; and he ran
into the hall to see for him may he come in? he may--h is a brave an
honest good grate boy he never guess who i wa after we left
you we went down to the kitchen togeth and there fool as i wa for
the pleasur of make mr christoph and the servant laugh began to
mimic you thi boy said he would not stand by and hear you laugh at;
that you had save hi life; that i ought to be asham of myself; that
you had just given me half a crown; and so you had; but i went on and
told him id knock him down if he said anoth word he did; i gave the
first blow; we fought; i came to the ground; the servant pull me up
again they found out i dont know how that i wa not a chimney-
sweeper the rest you saw and now can you forgiv me sir? said
frederick to mr eden seiz hold of hi hand

the other hand friend said the quaker gentli withdraw hi right
hand which everybodi now observ wa much swell and put it into
hi bosom again thi and welcom offer hi other hand to
frederick and shake hi with a smile

oh that other hand! said frederick that wa hurt i rememb how
ill i have behaved--extrem ill! but thi is a lesson that i shall
never forget as long as i live i hope for the futur i shall behav
like a gentleman

and like a man--and like a good man i am sure thou wilt said the good
quaker shake frederick hand affectionately; or i am much mistaken
friend in that black counten

you are not mistaken cri mariann frederick will never be
persuad again by anybodi to do what he doe not think right: and now
brother you may wash your black counten

just when frederick had got rid of half hi black counten a doubl
knock wa heard at the door it wa mr and mr montagu what will
you do now? whisper mr theresa to frederick as hi father and
mother came into the room

a chimney-sweep cover with blood! exclaim mr and mr montagu

stood in astonish

frederick! my son!

ye mother im not hurt half so much as i deserve; ill tell you--

nay interrupt bertha let my brother tell the stori thi time
thou hast told it onc and told it well; no one but my brother could
tell it better

a stori never tell so well the second time to be sure said mr
theresa; but mr eden will certainli make the best of it

without take ani notic of mr tattl or her apprehens look mr
eden explain all he knew of the affair in a few word your son
conclud he will quickli put off hi dirti dress the dress hath not
stain the mind; that is fair and honour when he found himself in
the wrong he said so; nor wa he in hast to conceal hi adventur from
hi father; thi made me think well of both father and son i speak
plainli friend for that is best but what is becom of the other
chimney-sweeper? he will want to go home said mr eden turn to
mr theresa without make ani repli she hurri out of the room as
fast as possibl and return in a few moment with a look of extrem
constern

here is a catastroph indeed! now inde mr frederick your papa and
mamma have reason to be angri a new suit of clothes!--th bare face
villain! gone! no sign of them in my closet or anywher the door wa
locked; he must have gone up the chimney out upon the lead and so
escaped; but christoph is after him i protest mr montagu you
take it too quietli the wretch!--a new suit of cloth blue coat and
buff waistcoat i never heard of such a thing! i declar mr montagu
you are vastli good not to be in a passion ad mr theresa

think the loss of a suit of cloth and even the disgrac that my son
ha been brought to thi even fortun circumst in hi
educ he will i am persuad judg and act for himself more
wise in futur nor will he be tempt to offend against human for
the sake of be call the best mimic in the world



the bar out; or parti spirit

the mother of mischief say an old proverb is no bigger than a
midg wing

at doctor middleton school there wa a great tall dunc of the name of
fisher who never could be taught how to look out a word in the
dictionari he use to torment everybodi with--do pray help me! i
cant make out thi one word the person who usual help him in hi
distress wa a veri clever good natur boy of the name of de grey who
had been mani year under dr middleton care and who by hi abil
and good conduct did him great credit the doctor certainli wa both
proud and fond of him; but he wa so well belov or so much esteem by
hi companion that nobodi had ever call him by the odiou name of
favourit until the arriv of a new scholar of the name of archer

till archer came the idea of favourit and parti were almost unknown
at dr middletons; but he brought all these idea fresh from a great
public school at which he had been educated--at which he had acquir a
suffici quantiti of greek and latin and a superabund quantiti of
parti spirit hi aim the moment he came to a new school wa to get to
the head of it or at least to form the strongest parti hi influenc
for he wa a boy of consider abil wa quickli felt though he
had a power rival as he thought proper to call him in de grey; and
with him a rival wa alway an enemi de grey so far from give him
ani caus of hatr treat him with a degre of cordial which would
probabl have had an effect upon archer mind if it had not been for
the artific of fisher

it may seem surpris that a great dunc should be abl to work upon a
boy like an archer who wa call a great genius; but when geniu is
join to a violent temper instead of be unit to good sens it is
at the merci even of dunc

fisher wa mortal offend one morn by de grey refus to
translat hi whole lesson for him he went over to archer who
consid him as a partisan desert from the enemi receiv him with
open arm and translat hi whole lesson without express much
contempt for hi stupid from thi moment fisher forgot all de grey
former kind and consid onli how he could in hi turn mortifi the
person whom he felt to be so much hi superior

de grey and archer were now read for a premium which wa to be given
in their class fisher bet on archer head who had not sens enough
to despis the bet of a blockhead on the contrari he suffer him to
excit the spirit of rivalship in it utmost furi by collect the bet
of all the school so that thi premium now becam a matter of the
greatest consequ and archer instead of take the mean to secur a
judgment in hi favour wa listen to the opinion of all hi
companion it wa a prize which wa to be won by hi own exertions; but
he suffer himself to consid it as an affair of chanc the
consequ wa that he trust to chance--hi partisan lost their
wager and he the premium--and hi temper

mr archer said dr middleton after the grand affair wa decid
you have done all that geniu alon could do; but you de grey have
done all that geniu and industri unit could do

well! cri archer with affect gaieti as soon as the doctor had
left the room--wel im content with my sentenc geniu alone! for
me--industri for those who want it ad he with a signific look at
de grey

fisher applaud thi as a veri spirit speech; and by insinu
that dr middleton alway gave the premium to de grey and that those
who had lost their bet might thank themselv for it for be such
simpleton as to bet against the favourit he rais a murmur highli
flatter to archer amongst some of the most credul boys; whilst
other loudli proclaim their belief in dr middleton imparti
these warmli congratul de grey at thi archer grew more and more
angri and when fisher wa proceed to speak nonsens for him push
forward into the circl to de grey cri i wish mr fisher you
would let me fight my own battles!

and _i_ wish said young townsend who wa fonder of divers than of
premium or battl or of anyth else--_i_ wish that we were not to
have ani battles; after have work like hors dont set about to
fight like dog come said he tap de grey shoulder let us see
your new playhous do--it a holiday and let us make the most of it
let us have the school for scandal do; and ill play charl for you
and you de grey shall be my littl premium come do open thi new
playhous of your to-night

come then! said de grey and he ran across the playground to a wast
build at the farthest end of it in which at the earnest request of
the whole commun and with the permiss of dr middleton he had
with much pain and ingenu erect a theatr

the new theatr is go to be opened! follow the manager! follow the
manager! echo a multitud of voic

follow the manager! echo veri disagre in archer ear; but as he
could not be left alon he wa also oblig to follow the manag the
moment that the door wa unlock the crowd rush in: the delight and
wonder express at the sight wa great and the applaus and thank
which were bestow upon the manag were long and loud

archer at least thought them long for he wa impati till hi voic
could be heard when at length the acclam had spent themselv he
walk across the stage with a know air and look round
contemptu

and is thi your famou playhouse? cri he i wish you had ani of
you seen the playhous _i_ have been use to?

these word made a great and visibl chang in the feel and opinion
of the public who would be a servant of the public? or who would toil
for popular applause? a few word spoken in a decis tone by a new
voic oper as a charm and the playhous wa in an instant
metamorphos in the eye of the spectat all gratitud for the past
wa forgotten and the expect of someth better justifi to the
caprici multitud their disdain of what they had so late pronounc
to be excel

everyon now began to criticis one observ that the green curtain
wa full of hole and would not draw up anoth attack the scenes;
scenes! they were not like real scenes--arch must know best becaus
he wa use to these thing so everybodi crowd to hear someth of
the other playhous they gather round archer to hear the descript
of hi playhous and at everi sentenc insult comparison were made
when he had done hi auditor look round sigh and wish that
archer had been their manag they turn from de grey as from a person
who had done them an injuri some of hi friends--for he had friend who
were not sway by the popular opinion--felt indign at thi
ingratitud and were go to express their feelings; but de grey
stop them and beg that he might speak for himself

gentlemen said he come forward as soon as he felt that he had
suffici command of himself my friend i see you are discont
with me and my playhous i have done my best to pleas you; but if
anybodi els can pleas you better i shall be glad of it i did not
work so hard for the glori of be your manag you have my free leav
to tear down-- here hi voic falter but he hurri on--you have my
free leav to tear down all my work as fast as you pleas archer shake
hand first howev to show that there no malic in the case

archer who wa touch by what hi rival said and stop the hand of
hi new partisan fisher cri no fisher! no!--no pull down we
can alter it there is a great deal of ingenu in it consid

in vain archer would now have recal the public to reason--th time
for reason wa passed: enthusiasm had taken hold of their mind down
with it! down with it! archer for ever! cri fisher and tore down
the curtain the riot onc begun noth could stop the littl mob
till the whole theatr wa demolish the love of power prevail in
the mind of archer; he wa secretli flatter by the zeal of hi parti
and he mistook their love of mischief for attach to himself de grey
look on superior i said i could bear to see all thi and i can
said he; now it is all over and now it wa all over there wa
silenc the rioter stood still to take breath and to look at what
they had done there wa a blank space befor them

in thi moment of silenc there wa heard someth like a voic hush!
what strang voic is that? said archer fisher caught fast hold of hi
arm everybodi look round to see where the voic came from it wa
dusk two window-shutt at the farthest end of the build were seen
to move slowli inward de grey and in the same instant archer went
forward; and as the shutter open there appear through the hole the
dark face and shrivel hand of a veri old gipsi she did not speak;
but she look first at one and then at anoth at length she fix her
eye on de grey well woman said he what do you want with me?

want!--nothing--with you said the old woman; do you want noth with
me?

noth said de grey her eye immedi turn upon archer--y
want someth with me said she with emphasi

i--what do i want? repli archer

no said she chang her tone you want nothing--noth will you
ever want or i am much mistaken in that face

in that watch-chain she should have said for her quick eye had espi
archer watch-chain he wa the onli person in the compani who had a
watch and she therefor judg him to be the richest

had you ever your fortun told sir in your life?

not i! said he look at de grey as if he wa afraid of hi
ridicul if he listen to the gipsi

not you! no! for you will make your own fortun and the fortun of all
that belong to you!

there good news for my friends! cri archer

and im one of them rememb that cri fisher and i and i
join a number of voic

good luck to them! cri the gipsi good luck to them all!

then as soon as they had acquir suffici confid in her good
will they press up to the window there cri townsend as he
chanc to stumbl over the carpent mitr box which stood in the
way there a good omen for me ive stumbl on the mitr box; i
shall certainli be a bishop

happi he who had sixpenc for he bid fair to be a judg upon the bench
and happier he who had a shill for he wa in the high road to be one
day upon the woolsack lord high chancellor of england no one had half
a crown or no one would sure have kept it in hi pocket upon such an
occas for he might have been an archbishop a king or what he
pleas

fisher who like all weak peopl wa extrem credul kept hi post
immov in the front row all the time hi mouth open and hi stupid
eye fix upon the gipsi in whom he felt implicit faith

those who have least confid in their own power and who have least
expect from the success of their own exert are alway most
dispos to trust in fortune-tel and fortun they hope to win when
they cannot earn; and as they can never be convinc by those who speak
sens it is no wonder they are alway persuad by those who talk
nonsens

i have a question to put said fisher in a solemn tone

put it then said archer what hinder you?

but they will hear me said he look suspici at de grey

_i_ shall not hear you said de grey i am go everybodi els
drew back and left him to whisper hi question in the gipsi ear

what is becom of my livy?

your sister livi do you mean? said the gipsi

no my latin livi

the gipsi paus for inform it had a leaf torn out in the
begin and i hate dr middleton--

written in it interrupt the gipsi

right--th veri book! cri fisher with joy but how could you know
it wa dr middleton name? i thought i had scratch it so that
nobodi could make it out

nobodi could make it out but me repli the gipsi but never think
to deceiv me said she shake her head at him in a manner that made
him trembl

i dont deceiv you inde i tell you the whole truth i lost it a
week ago

true

and when shall i find it?

meet me here at thi hour to-morrow even and i will answer you no
more! i must be gone not a word more to-night

she pull the shutter toward her and left the youth in dark all
hi companion were gone he had been so deepli engag in thi
confer that he had not perceiv their departur he found all the
world at supper but no entreati could prevail upon him to disclos hi
secret townsend ralli in vain as for archer he wa not dispos to
destroy by ridicul the effect which he saw that the old woman
predict in hi favour had had upon the imagin of mani of hi
littl partisan he had privat slip two good shill into the
gipsi hand to secur her; for he wa will to pay ani price for ani
mean of acquir power

the watch-chain had not deceiv the gipsi for archer wa the richest
person in the commun hi friend had imprud suppli him with
more money than is usual trust to boy of hi age dr middleton had
refus to give him a larger monthli allow than the rest of hi
companions; but he brought to school with him secretli the sum of five
guinea thi appear to hi friend and to himself an inexhaust
treasur

rich and talent would he flatter himself secur to him that
ascend of which he wa so ambiti am i your manag or not?
wa now hi question i scorn to take advantag of a hasti moment; but
sinc last night you have had time to consid if you desir me to be
your manag you shall see what a theatr i will make for you in thi
purs said he show through the network a glimps of the shine
treasure--in thi purs is aladdin wonder lamp am i your manager?
put it to the vote

it wa put to the vote about ten of the most reason of the assembl
declar their gratitud and high approb of their old friend de
grey; but the number were in favour of the new friend and as no
metaphys distinct rel to the idea of a major had ever
enter their thought the most numer parti consid themselv as
now beyond disput in the right they drew off on one side in triumph
and their leader who knew the consequ of a name in parti matter
immedi distinguish hi partisan by the gallant name of archer
stigmat the friend of de grey by the odiou epithet of greybeard

amongst the archer wa a class not veri remark for their mental
qualifications; but who by their bodili activ and by the peculiar
advantag annex to their way of life render themselv of the
highest consequ especi to the rich and enterpris

the judici reader will apprehend that i allud to the person call
day scholar amongst these fisher wa distinguish by hi knowledg
of all the street and shop in the adjac town; and though a dull
scholar he had such reput as a man of busi that whoever had
commiss to execut at the confection wa sure to appli to him
some of the youngest of hi employ had it is true at time
complain that he made mistak of halfpenc and penc in their
accounts; but as these affair could never be brought to a public trial
fisher charact and consequ were undiminish till the fatal day
when hi aunt barbara forbad hi visit to the confectioners; or
rather till she request the confection who had hi privat reason
for obey her not to receiv her nephew visit as he had made
himself sick at hi hous and mr barbara fear for hi health were
incess

though hi visit to the confection were thu at an end there were
mani other shop open to him; and with offici zeal he offer hi
servic to the new manag to purchas whatev might be want for
the theatr

sinc hi father death fisher had becom a boarder at dr middleton
but hi frequent visit to hi aunt barbara afford him opportun of
go into the town the carpent de grey friend wa discard by
archer for have said lack-a-daisy! when he saw that the old theatr
wa pull down a new carpent and paper hanger recommend by
fisher were appoint to attend with their tool for order at two
oclock archer impati to show hi ingenu and hi generos
gave hi plan and hi order in a few minut in a most decid manner;
these thing he observ should be done with some spirit

all gave their honour to be secret and faith as he call it and he
went on did you ever hear of such a thing as a bar out my
friends? they had heard of such a thing but they had onli heard of it

archer gave the histori of a bar out in which he had been
concern at hi school in which the boy stood out against the master
and gain their point at last which wa a week more holiday at
easter* but if we should not succeed said they dr middleton is
so steady; he never goe back from what he ha said

did you ever tri to push him back? let us be steadi and hell trembl
tyrant alway trembl when--

oh interrupt a number of voices; but he is not a tyrant--i he?

all schoolmast are tyrants--ar not they? repli archer; and is
not he a schoolmaster?

to thi logic there wa no answer; but still reluct they ask
what they should get by a bar out?

get!--everything!--what we want!--which is everyth to lad of spirit-
-victori and liberty! bar him out till he repeal hi tyrann law;
till he let us into our own theatr again or till he tell us hi good
reason against it

but perhap he ha reason for not tell us

impossible! cri archer that the way we are alway to be govern
by a man in a wig who say he ha good reason and cant tell them
are you fools? go! go back to de grey! i see you are all greybeard
go! who goe first? nobodi would go first i will have noth to do
with ye if ye are resolv to be slaves! we wont be slaves! they
all exclaim at onc then said archer stand out in the right and
be free

*[thi custom of bar out wa veri gener (especi in the
northern part of england) dure the 17th and 18th centuri and it ha
been fulli describ by brand and other antiquarian writer

dr johnson mention that addison while under the tuition of mr shaw
master of the lichfield grammar school led and success conduct
a plan for bar out hi master a disorderli privileg say the
doctor which in hi time prevail in the princip seminari of
educ

in the gentleman magazin of 1828 dr p a nuttal under the
signatur of ii a n ha given a spirit sketch of a bar out at
the ormskirk grammar school which ha sinc been republish at length
(though without acknowledgment) by sir henri elli in bohn recent
edit of brand popular antiqu thi oper took place
earli in the present centuri and is interest from it be perhap
the last attempt on record and also from the circumst of the writer
himself have been one of the juvenil leader in the dare adventur
quo rum par magna fuit--ed]

the right it would have taken up too much time to examin what the
right wa archer wa alway sure that the right wa what hi parti
chose to do; that is what he chose to do himself; and such is the
influenc of number upon each other in conquer the feel of shame
and in confus the power of reason that in a few minut the
right wa forgotten and each said to himself to be sure archer is a
veri clever boy and he cant be mistaken; or to be sure townsend
think so and he would not do anyth to get us into a scrape; or to
be sure everybodi will agre to thi but myself and i cant stand out
alon to be point at as a greybeard and a slave everybodi think it
is right and everybodi cant be wrong

by some of these argument which pass rapidli through the mind without
hi be consciou of them each boy decid and deceiv himself--what
none would have done alon none scrupl to do as a parti it wa
determin then that there should be a bar out the arrang of
the affair wa left to their new manag to whom they all pledg
implicit obedi obedi it seem is necessari even from rebel
to their ringleaders; not reason but implicit obedi

scarc had the assembl adjourn to the ball-alley when fisher with
an import length of face came up to the manag and desir to speak
one word to him my advic to you archer is to do noth in thi
till we have consult you know who about whether it right or wrong

you know who! whom do you mean? make hast and dont make so mani
face for im in a hurri who is you know who?

the old woman said fisher gravely; the gipsi

you may consult the old woman said archer burst out a-laugh
about what right and wrong if you please; but no old woman shall
decid for me

no; but you dont take me said fisher; you dont take me by right
and wrong i mean lucki and unlucki

whatev _i_ do will be lucki repli archer my gipsi told you that
alreadi

i know i know said fisher and what she said about your friend
be lucky--that went a great way with mani ad he with a sagaci
nod of hi head; i can tell you that--mor than you think do you
know said he lay hold of archer button im in the secret
there are nine of us have crook our littl finger upon it not to stir
a step till we get her advice; and she ha appoint me to meet her about
particular busi of my own at eight so im to consult her and to
bring her answer

archer knew too well how to govern fool to attempt to reason with them;
and instead of laugh ani longer at fisher ridicul superstit
he wa determin to take advantag of it he affect to be persuad
of the wisdom of the measure; look at hi watch; urg him to be exact
to a moment; conjur him to rememb exactli the word of the oracle;
and abov all thing to demand the lucki hour and minut when the
bar out should begin with these instruct archer put hi watch
into the solemn dupe hand and left him to count the second till the
moment of hi appoint whilst he ran off himself to prepar the
oracl

at a littl gate which look into a lane through which he guess that
the gipsi must pass he station himself saw her gave her half a crown
and her instruct made hi escap and got back unsuspect to
fisher whom he found in the attitud in which he had left him watch
the motion of the minut hand

proud of hi secret commiss fisher slouch hi hat he knew not whi
over hi face and proceed toward the appoint spot to keep as he
had been charg by archer within the letter of the law he stood behind
the forbidden build and wait some minut

through a gap in the hedg the old woman at length made her appear
muffl up and look cautious about her there nobodi near us!
said fisher and he began to be a littl afraid what answer said he
recollect himself about my livy?

lost! lost! lost! said the gipsi lift up her hands; never never
never to be found! but no matter for that now; that is not your errand
to-night; no trick with me; speak to me of what is next your heart

fisher astonish put hi hand upon hi heart told her all that she
knew befor and receiv the answer that archer had dictated: that
the archer should be lucki as long as they stuck to their manag and
to one another; that the bar out should end in woe if not begun
precis as the clock should strike nine on wednesday night; but if
begun in that lucki moment and all obedi to their lucki leader all
should end well

a thought a provid thought now struck fisher; for even he had some
foresight where hi favourit passion wa concern pray in our
bar out shall we be starved?

no said the gipsi not if you trust to me for food and if you give
me money enough silver wont do for so many; gold is what must cross my
hand

i have no gold said fisher and i dont know what you mean by so
mani im onli talk of number one you know i must take care of
that first

so as fisher thought it wa possibl that archer clever as he wa
might be disappoint in hi suppli he determin to take secret
measur for himself hi aunt barbara interdict had shut him out
of the confection shop; but he flatter himself that he could outwit
hi aunt; he therefor beg the gipsi to procur him twelv bun by
thursday morn and bring them secretli to one of the window of the
schoolroom

as fisher did not produc ani money when he made thi propos it wa at
first absolut rejected; but a bribe at length conquer hi
difficulties; and the bribe which fisher found himself oblig to give--
for he had no pocket money left of hi own he be as much restrict
in that articl as archer wa indulged--th bribe that he found himself
oblig to give to quiet the gipsi wa half a crown which archer had
intrust to him to buy candl for the theatr oh thought he to
himself; archer so careless about money he will never think of ask
me for the half-crown again; and now hell want no candl for the
theatre; or at anyr it will be some time first; and mayb aunt
barbara may be got to give me that much at christmas; then if the worst
come to the worst one can pay archer my mouth water for the bun
and have em i must now

so for the hope of twelv bun he sacrif the money which had been
intrust to him thu the meanest motiv in mean mind often prompt
to the commiss of those great fault to which one should think
noth but some violent passion could have tempt

the ambassador have thu in hi opinion conclud hi own and the
public busi return well satisfi with the result after receiv
the gipsi reiter promis to tap three time at the window on
thursday morn

the day appoint for the bar out at length arrived; and archer
assembl the confeder inform them that all wa prepar for
carri their design into execution; that he now depend for success
upon their punctual and courag he had within the last two hour
got all their bar readi to fasten the door and window shutter of the
schoolroom; he had with the assist of two of the day scholar who
were of the parti sent into the town for provis at hi own expens
which would make a handsom supper for that night; he had also negoti
with some cousin of hi who live in the town for a constant suppli in
futur bless me exclaim archer suddenli stop in thi
narrat of hi servic there one thing after all ive forgot we
shall be undon without it fisher pray did you ever buy the candl
for the playhouse?

no to be sure repli fisher extrem frightened; you know you
dont want candl for the playhous now

not for the playhous but for the bar out we shall be in the
dark man you must run thi minut run

for candles? said fisher confused; how many?--what sort?

stupidity! exclaim archer you are a pretti fellow at a dead lift!
lend me a pencil and a bit of paper do; ill write down what i want
myself! well what are you fumbl for?

for money! said fisher colour

money man! didnt i give you half a crown the other day?

ye repli fisher stammering; but i wasnt sure that that might be
enough

enough! ye to be sure it will i dont know what you are at

noth noth said fisher here write upon thi then said
fisher put a piec of paper into archer hand upon which archer
wrote hi order away away! cri he

away went fisher he returned; but not until a consider time
afterward they were at supper when he return fisher alway come
in at supper-tim observ one of the greybeard carelessli

well and would you have him come in after supper-time? said townsend
who alway suppli hi parti with readi wit

ive got the candl whisper fisher as he pass by archer to hi
place

and the tinder-box? said archer

yes; i got back from my aunt barbara under pretenc that i must studi
for repetit day an hour later to-night so i got leav wa not that
clever?

a dunc alway think it clever to cheat even by sober lie how mr
fisher procur the candl and the tinder box without money and without
credit we shall discov further on

archer and hi associ had agre to stay the last in the schoolroom;
and as soon as the greybeard were gone out to bed he as the signal
wa to shut and lock one door townsend the other a third conspir
wa to strike a light in case they should not be abl to secur a
candl a fourth wa to take charg of the candl as soon as lighted;
and all the rest were to run to their bar which were secret in a
room; then to fix them to the common fasten bar of the window in the
manner in which they had been previous instruct by the manag thu
each had hi part assign and each wa warn that the success of the
whole depend upon their order and punctual

order and punctual it appear are necessari even in a bar out;
and even rebellion must have it law

the long expect moment at length arriv de grey and hi friend
unconsci of what wa go forward walk out of the schoolroom as
usual at bedtim the clock began to strike nine there wa one
greybeard left in the room who wa pack up some of hi book which
had been left about by accid it is imposs to describ the
impati with which he wa watch especi by fisher and the nine
who depend upon the gipsi oracl

when he had got all hi book togeth under hi arm he let one of them
fall; and whilst he stoop to pick it up archer gave the signal the
door were shut lock and double-lock in an instant a light wa
struck and each ran to hi post the bar were all in the same moment
put up to the window and archer when he had tri them all and seen
that they were secur gave a loud huzza!--in which he wa join by
all the parti most manfully--bi all but the poor greybeard who the
pictur of astonish stood stock still in the midst of them with hi
book under hi arm; at which spectacl townsend who enjoy the frolic
of the fray more than anyth els burst into an immoder fit of
laughter so my littl greybeard said he hold a candl full in
hi eye what think you of all this?--how came you amongst the wick
ones?

i dont know inde said the littl boy veri gravely: you shut me
up amongst you wont you let me out?

let you out! no no my littl greybeard said archer catch hold
of him and drag him to the window bar look ye here--touch these-
-put your hand to them--pul push kick--put a littl spirit into it
man--kick like an archer if you can; away with ye it a piti that the
king of the greybeard is not here to admir me i should like to show
him our fortif but come my merri men all now to the feast
out with the tabl into the middl of the room good cheer my jolli
archers! im your manager!

townsend delight with the bustl rub hi hand and caper about
the room whilst the prepar for the feast were hurri forward
four candles!--four candl on the tabl let have thing in style
when we are about it mr manag cri townsend places!--places!
there noth like a fair scrambl my boy let everyon take care of
himself hallo! greybeard ive knock greybeard down here in the
scuffl get up again my lad and see a littl life

no no cri fisher he shant sup with us

no no cri the manag he shant live with us; a greybeard is not
fit compani for archer

no no cri townsend evil commun corrupt good manner

so with one unanim hiss they hunt the poor littl gentl boy into a
corner; and have pent him up with bench fisher open hi book for
him which he thought the greatest mortif and set up a candl
besid him--ther now he look like a greybeard as he is! cri they
tell me what the latin for cold roast beef? said fisher exultingli
and they return to their feast

long and loud they revel they had a few bottl of cider give me
the corkscrew the cider shant be kept till it sour cri townsend
in answer to the manag who when he beheld the provis vanish
with surpris rapid began to fear for the morrow hang to-
morrow! cri townsend let greybeard think of to-morrow; mr manag
here your good health

the archer all stood up as their cup were fill to drink the health of
their chief with a univers cheer but at the moment that the cup were
at their lip and as archer bow to thank the compani a sudden shower
from abov astonish the whole assembl they look up and beheld the
rose of a watering-engin whose long neck appear through a trap door
in the ceil your good health mr manager! said a voic which wa
known to be the gardeners; and in the midst of their surpris and dismay
the candl were suddenli extinguished; the trap-door shut down; and they
were left in utter dark

the devil! said archer

dont swear mr manag said the same voic from the ceil i hear
everi word you say

merci upon us! exclaim fisher the clock ad he whisper
must have been wrong for it had not done strike when we began onli
you rememb archer it had just done befor you had done lock your
door

hold your tongu blockhead! said archer well boys! were ye never
in the dark before? you are not afraid of a shower of rain i hope is
anybodi drowned?

no said they with a faint laugh but what shall we do here in the
dark all night long and all day to-morrow? we cant unbar the
shutter

it a wonder nobodi ever thought of the trap-door! said townsend

the trap-door had inde escap the manag observ as the hous
wa new to him and the ceil be newli white-wash the open wa
scarc percept vex to be out-general and still more vex
to have it remark archer pour forth a volley of incoher
exclam and reproach against those who were thu so soon
discourag by a trifle; and grope for the tinder-box he ask if
anyth could be easier than to strike a light again* the light
appear but at the moment that it made the tinder-box visibl anoth
shower from abov aim and aim exactli at the tinder-box drench
it with water and render it total unfit for further servic archer
in a furi dash it to the ground and now for the first time he felt
what it wa to be the unsuccess head of a parti he heard in hi turn
the murmur of a discont changeabl populace; and recollect all
hi bar and bolt and ingeni contriv he wa more provok at
their blame him for thi one onli oversight than he wa griev at the
disast itself

*lucif match were then unknown-

oh my hair is all wet! cri one dole

wring it then said archer

my hand cut with your broken glass cri anoth

glass! cri a third; mercy! is there broken glass? and it all
about i suppos amongst the supper; and i had but one bit of bread all
the time

bread! cri archer; eat if you want it here a piec here and no
glass near it

it all wet and i dont like dri bread by itself; that no feast

heigh-day! what noth but moan and grumbling! if these are the
joy of a bar out cri townsend id rather be snug in my bed i
expect that we should have sat up till twelv oclock talk and
laugh and sing

so you may still; what hinder you? said archer sing and well join
you and i should be glad those fellow overhead heard us sing
begin townsend--

come now all ye social power
spread your influenc oer us--

or else--

rule britannia! britannia rule the waves!
briton never will be slave

noth can be more melancholi than forc merriment in vain they
roar in choru in vain they tri to appear gay it would not do
the voic die away and drop off one by one they had each provid
himself with a great-coat to sleep upon; but now in the dark there wa
a peevish scrambl contest for the coat and half the compani in veri
bad humour stretch themselv upon the bench for the night

there is great pleasur in bear anyth that ha the appear of
hardship as long as there is ani glori to be acquir by it: but when
peopl feel themselv foil there is no further pleasur in endurance;
and if in their misfortun there is ani mixtur of the ridicul the
motiv for heroism are immedi destroy dr middleton had
probabl consid thi in the choic he made of hi first attack

archer who had spent the night as a man who had the care of govern
upon hi shoulder rose earli in the morn whilst everybodi els wa
fast asleep in the night he had resolv the affair of the trap-door
and a new danger had alarm him it wa possibl that the enemi might
descend upon them through the trap-door the room had been built high to
admit a free circul of air it wa twenti feet so that it wa in
vain to think of reach to the trap-door

as soon as the daylight appear archer rose softli that he might
reconnoitr and devis some method of guard against thi new danger
luckili there were round hole in the top of the window-shutt which
admit suffici light for him to work by the remain of the soak
feast wet candl and broken glass spread over the tabl in the middl
of the room look rather dismal thi morn

a pretti set of fellow i have to manage! said archer contempl
the group of sleeper befor him it is well they have somebodi to
think for them now if i wanted--which thank good i dont--but if
i did want to call a cabinet council to my assist whom could i pitch
upon? not thi stupid snorer who is dream of gipsi if he is
dream of anyth continu archer as he look into fisher open
mouth thi next chap is quick enough; but then he is so fond of
have everyth hi own way and thi curl pate monkey who is
grin in hi sleep is all tongu and no brain here are brain
though nobodi would think it in thi lump said he look at a fat
roll up heavi breath sleeper; but what signifi brain to such a
lazi dog? i might kick him for my footbal thi half hour befor i
should get him awak thi lank jaw harlequin besid him is a handi
fellow to be sure; but then if he ha hand he ha no head--and hed
be afraid of hi own shadow too by thi light he is such a coward! and
townsend whi he ha pun in plenty; but when there ani work to be
done he the worst fellow to be near one in the world--h can do
noth but laugh at hi own pun thi poor littl fellow that we
hunt into the corner ha more sens than all of them put together; but
then he is a greybeard

thu specul the chief of a parti upon hi sleep friend and how
did it happen that he should be so ambiti to pleas and govern thi
set when for each individu of which it wa compos he felt such
suprem contempt? he had form them into a parti had given them a
name and he wa at their head if these be not good reason none
better can be assign for archer conduct

i wish ye could all sleep on said he; but i must waken ye though you
will be onli in my way the sound of my hammer must waken them; so i
may as well do the thing handsom and flatter some of them by
pretend to ask their advic

accordingli he pull two or three to waken them come townsend
waken my boy! here some divers for you--up! up!

diversion! cri townsend; im your man! im up--up to anyth

so under the name of divers archer set townsend to work at four
oclock in the morn they had nail a few tool and sever spar
still left from the wreck of the playhous these by archer
direct they sharpen at one end and nail them to the end of
sever form

all hand were now call to clear away the supper thing to erect these
form perpendicularli under the trap-door; and with the assist of a
few brace a chevaux-de-fris wa form upon which nobodi could
ventur to descend at the farthest end of the room they likewis form
a penthous of the tabl under which they propos to breakfast secur
from the pelt storm if it should again assail them through the trap-
door they crowd under the penthous as soon as it wa readi and
their admir of it ingenu paid the workmen for the job

lord! i shall like to see the garden phiz through the trap-door
when he behold the spike under him! cri townsend now for
breakfast!

ay now for breakfast said archer look at hi watch; past eight
oclock and my town boy not come! i dont understand this!

archer had expect a constant suppli of provis from two boy who
live in the town who were cousin of hi and who had promis to come
everi day and put food in at a certain hole in the wall in which a
ventil usual turn thi ventil archer had taken down and
had contriv it so that it could be easili remov and replac at
pleasure; but upon examin it wa now perceiv that the hole had
been newli stop up by an iron back which it wa imposs to
penetr or remov

it never came into my head that anybodi would ever have thought of the
ventil but myself! exclaim archer in great perplex he
listen and wait for hi cousins; but no cousin came and at a late
hour the compani were oblig to breakfast upon the scatter fragment
of the last night feast that feast had been spread with such
imprud profus that littl now remain to satisfi the hungri
guest

archer who well knew the effect which the apprehens of a scarciti
would have upon hi associ did everyth that could be done by a
bold counten and reiter assert to persuad them that hi
cousin would certainli come at last and that the suppli were onli
delay the delay howev wa alarm

fisher alon heard the manag calcul and saw the public fear
unmov secretli rejoic in hi own wisdom he walk from window to
window slili listen for the gipsi signal there it is! cri he
with more joy sparkl in hi eye than had ever enlighten them
befor come thi way archer; but dont tell anybodi hark! do ye
hear those three tap at the window? thi is the old woman with twelv
bun for me ill give you one whole one for yourself if you will unbar
the window for me

unbar the window! interrupt archer; no that i wont for you or the
gipsi either; but i have heard enough to get your bun without that but
stay; there is someth of more consequ than your twelv bun i
must think for ye all i see regularli

so he summon a council and propos that everyon should subscrib
and trust the subscript to the gipsi to purchas a fresh suppli of
provis archer laid down a guinea of hi own money for hi
subscription; at which sight all the compani clap their hand and hi
popular rose to a high pitch with their renew hope of plenti now
have made a list of their want they fold the money in the paper
put it into a bag which archer tie to a long string and have broken
the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window-shutt he let
down the bag to the gipsi she promis to be punctual and have
fill the bag with fisher twelv bun they were drawn up in triumph
and everybodi anticip the pleasur with which they should see the
same bag drawn up at dinner-tim the bun were a littl squeez in
be drawn through the hole in the window-shutter; but archer
immedi saw out a piec of the shutter and broke the correspond
pane in each of the other window to prevent suspicion and to make it
appear that they had all been broken to admit air

what a piti that so much ingenu should have been employ to no
purpose!

it may have surpris the intellig reader that the gipsi wa so
punctual to her promis to fisher but we must recollect that her
appar integr wa onli cunning; she wa punctual that she might be
employ again that she might be intrust with the contribut which
she foresaw must be rais amongst the famish garrison no sooner
had she receiv the money than her end wa gain

dinner-tim came; it struck three four five six they listen with
hungri ear but no signal wa heard the morn had been veri long
and archer had in vain tri to dissuad them from devour the
remaind of the provis befor they were sure of a fresh suppli and
now those who had been the most confid were the most impati of
their disappoint

archer in the divis of the food had attempt by the most
scrupul exact to content the public and he wa both astonish
and provok to perceiv that hi imparti wa impeach so
differ do peopl judg in differ situations! he wa the first
person to accus hi master of injustic and the least capabl of
bear such an imput upon himself from other he now experienc
some of the joy of power and the delight of manag unreason
number

have not i done everyth i could to pleas you? have not i spent my
money to buy you food? have not i divid the last morsel with you? i
have not tast one mouth today! did not i set to work for you at
sunrise? did not i lie awak all night for you? have not i had all the
labour and all the anxiety? look round and see my contriv my
work my generosity! and after all you think me a tyrant becaus i
want you to have common sens is not thi bun which i hold in my hand
my own? did not i earn it by my own ingenu from that selfish dunc
(point to fisher) who could never have gotten one of hi twelv
bun if i had not shown him how? eleven of them he ha eaten sinc
morn for hi own share without offer anyon a morsel; but i scorn
to eat even what is justli my own when i see so mani hungri creatur
long for it i wa not go to touch thi last morsel myself i
onli beg you to keep it till supper-tim when perhap youll want it
more and townsend who cant bear the slightest thing that cross hi
own whim and who think there noth in thi world to be mind but
hi own divers call me a tyrant you all of you promis to obey
me the first thing i ask you to do for your own good and when if you
had common sens you must know i can want noth but your good you
rebel against me traitors! fools! ungrat fools!

archer walk up and down unabl to command hi emot whilst for the
moment the discont multitud wa silenc

here said he strike hi hand upon the littl boy shoulder
here the onli one amongst you who ha not utter one word of reproach
or complaint and he ha had but one bit of bread--a bit that i gave him
myself thi day here! said he snatch the bun which nobodi had
dare to touch take it--it mine--i give it to you though you are a
greybeard; you deserv it eat it and be an archer you shall be my
captain; will you? said he lift him up in hi arm abov the rest

i like you now said the littl boy courageously; but i love de grey
better; he ha alway been my friend and he advis me never to call
myself ani of those name archer or greybeard; so i wont though i am
shut in here i have noth to do with it i love dr middleton; he
wa never unjust to me and i daresay that he ha veri good reason as
de grey said for forbid us to go into that hous besid it hi
own

instead of admir the good sens and steadi of thi littl lad
archer suffer townsend to snatch the untast bun out of hi hand he
flung it at a hole in the window but it fell back the archer
scrambl for it and fisher ate it

archer saw thi and wa sensibl that he had not done handsom in
suffer it a few moment ago he had admir hi own generos and
though he had felt the injustic of other he had not accus himself of
ani he turn away from the littl boy and sit down at one end of
the tabl hid hi face in hi hand he continu immov in thi
postur for some time

lord! said townsend; it wa an excel joke!

pooh! said fisher; what a fool to think so much about a bun!

never mind mr archer if you are think about me said the littl
boy tri gentli to pull hi hand from hi face

archer stoop down and lift him up upon the tabl at which sight the
partisan set up a gener hiss he ha forsaken us! he desert hi
party! he want to be a greybeard! after he ha got us all into thi
scrape he will leav us!

i am not go to leav you cri archer no one shall ever accus
me of desert my parti ill stick by the archer right or wrong i
tell you to the last moment but thi littl fellow--tak it as you
pleas mutini if you will and throw me out of the window call me
traitor! coward! greybeard!--thi littl fellow is worth you all put
togeth and ill stand by him against anyon who dare to lay a finger
upon him; and the next morsel of food that i see shall be hi touch him
who dares!

the command air with which archer spoke and look and the belief
that the littl boy deserv hi protect silenc the crowd but the
storm wa onli hush

no sound of merriment wa now to be heard--no battledor and shuttlecock-
-no ball no marbl some sat in a corner whisper their wish that
archer would unbar the door and give up other stretch their
arm and gape as they saunter up and down the room wish for air
or food or water fisher and hi nine who had such firm depend
upon the gipsi now gave themselv up to utter despair it wa eight
oclock grow darker and darker everi minut and no candl no light
could they have the prospect of anoth long dark night made them still
more discont

townsend at the head of the yawner and fisher at the head of the
hungri malcont gather round archer and the few yet unconqu
spirit demand how long he meant to keep them in thi dark dungeon?
and whether he expect that they should starv themselv for hi sake?

the idea of give up wa more intoler to archer than all the rest
he saw that the major hi own convinc argument wa against him
he wa therefor oblig to condescend to the art of persuas he
flatter some with hope of food from the town boy some he remind
of their promises; other he prais for former prowess; and other he
shame by the repetit of their high vaunt in the begin of the
busi

it wa at length resolv that at all event they would hold out with
thi determin they stretch themselv again to sleep for the
second night in weak and weari obstinaci

archer slept longer and more soundli than usual the next morn and
when he awok he found hi hand tie behind him! three or four boy
had just got hold of hi feet which they press down whilst the
trembl hand of fisher were fasten the cord round them

with all the forc which rage could inspir archer struggl and roar
to hi archers!--hi friend hi party--for help against the traitor
but all kept aloof townsend in particular stood laugh and look
on i beg your pardon archer but realli you look so droll all aliv
and kicking! dont be angri im so weak i cannot help laugh
today

the packthread crack hi hand are free! he loose! cri the
least of the boy and ran away whilst archer leap up and seiz
hold of fisher with a power grasp sternli demand what he meant by
this?

ask my parti said fisher terrified; they set me on; ask my parti

your party! cri archer with a look of ineff contempt; you
reptile!--your party? can such a thing as you have a party?

to be sure! said fisher settl hi collar which archer in hi
surpris had let go; to be sure! whi not? ani man who choos it may
have a parti as well as yourself i suppos i have nine fishermen

at these word spoken with much sullen import archer in spite of
hi vexat could not help laugh fishermen! cri he
fishermen!

and whi not fishermen as well as archers? cri they one parti is
just as good as another; it is onli a question which can get the upper
hand; and we had your hand tie just now

that right townsend said archer laugh on my boy! friend or foe
it all the same to you i know how to valu your friendship now you
are a mighti good fellow when the sun shines; but let a storm come and
how you slink away!

at thi instant archer felt the differ between a good companion and
a good friend a differ which some peopl do not discov till late
in life

have i no friend?--no real friend amongst you all? and could ye stand
by and see my hand tie behind me like a thiefs? what signifi such
a party--al mute?

we want someth to eat answer the fishermen what signifi such
a parti indeed? and such a manag who can do noth for one?

and have _i_ done nothing?

dont let hear ani more prose said fisher; we are too mani for
you ive advis my parti if theyv a mind not to be starv to give
you up for the ringlead as you were; and dr middleton will not let us
all off i daresay so depend upon the sullen silenc of the
assembl he again approach archer with a cord a cri of no no no!
dont tie him wa feebli rais

archer stood still but the moment fisher touch him he knock him down
to the ground and turn to the rest with eye sparkl with
indign archers! cri he a voic at thi instant wa heard at
the door it wa de grey voic i have got a larg basket of
provis for your breakfast a gener shout of joy wa sent forth by
the voraci public breakfast! provisions! a larg basket! de grey
for ever! huzza!

de grey promis upon hi honour that if he would unbar the door nobodi
should come in with him and no advantag should be taken of them thi
promis wa enough even for archer i will let him in said he
myself; for im sure hell never break hi word he pull away the
bar; the door open and have bargain for the liberti of melson the
littl boy who had been shut in by mistak de grey enter with hi
basket of provis when he lock and bar the door instantli

joy and gratitud sparkl in everi face when he unpack hi basket and
spread the tabl with a plenti breakfast a hundr question were
ask him at onc eat first said he and we will talk afterward
thi busi wa quickli despatch by those who had not tast food for
a long while their curios increas as their hunger diminish
who sent us breakfast? doe dr middleton know? were question
reiter from everi mouth

he doe know answer de grey; and the first thing i have to tell you
is that i am your fellow-prison i am to stay here till you give up
thi wa the onli condit on which dr middleton would allow me to
bring you food and he will allow no more

everyon look at the empti basket but archer in whom half vanquish
parti spirit reviv with the strength he had got from hi breakfast
broke into exclam in prais of de grey magnanim as he now
imagin that de grey had becom one of themselv

and you will join us will you? that a nobl fellow!

no answer de grey calmly; but i hope to persuad or rather to
convinc you that you ought to join me

you would have found it no hard task to have persuad or convinc us
whichev you pleas said townsend if you had appeal to archer
fasting; but archer feast are quit other anim even caesar
himself after breakfast is quit anoth thing! ad he point to
archer

you may speak for yourself mr townsend repli the insult hero
but not for me or for archer in gener if you pleas we unbar
the door upon the faith of de grey promise--that wa not give up
and it would have been just as difficult i promis you to persuad or
convinc me either that i should give up against my honour befor
breakfast as after

thi spirit speech wa applaud by mani who had now forgotten the
feel of famin not so fisher whose memori wa upon thi occas
veri distinct

what nonsens and the orat paus for a synonym express but
none wa at hand what nonsens and--nonsens is here! whi dont you
rememb that dinner-tim and supper-tim and breakfast-tim will come
again? so what signifi mouth about persuad and convincing? we
will not go through again what we did yesterday! honour me no honour i
dont understand it id rather be flog at onc as i have been
mani the good time for a less thing i say wed better all be flog
at onc which must be the end of it sooner or later than wait here to
be without dinner breakfast and supper all onli becaus mr archer
wont give up becaus of hi honour and nonsense!

mani prudent face amongst the fishermen seem to deliber at the
close of thi orat in which the argument were brought so home to
each man busi and bosom

but said de grey when we yield i hope it will not be mere to get
our dinner gentlemen when we yield archer--

dont address yourself to me interrupt archer struggl with hi
pride; you have no further occas to tri to win me i have no power
no parti you see! and now i find that i have no friend i dont care
what becom of myself i suppos im to be given up as a ringlead
here thi fisher and a parti of hi fishermen were go to tie me
hand and foot if i had not knock him down just as you came to the
door de grey; and now perhap you will join fisher parti against me

de grey wa go to assur him that he had no intent of join ani
parti when a sudden chang appear on archer counten silence!
cri archer in an imperi tone and there wa silenc someon wa
heard to whistl the begin of a tune that wa perfectli new to
everybodi present except to archer who immedi whistl the
conclus there! cri he look at de grey with triumph; that
a method of hold secret correspond whilst a prison which i
learn from richard coeur de lion i know how to make use of
everyth hallo! friend! are you there at last? cri he go to
the ventil

ye but we are bar out here

round to the window then and fill our bag well let it down my lad
in a trice; bar me out who can!

archer let down the bag with all the expedit of joy and it wa fill
with all the expedit of fear pull away! make hast for heaven
sake! said the voic from without; the garden will come from dinner
els and we shall be caught he mount guard all yesterday at the
ventilator; and though i watch and watch till it wa darker than
pitch i could not get near you i dont know what ha taken him out of
the way now make hast pull away! the heavi bag wa soon pull up

a delight review wa now made of their treasur busi hand arrang
and sort the heterogen mass archer in the height of hi glori
look on the acknowledg master of the whole townsend who in hi
prosper as in advers saw and enjoy the comic foibl of hi
friend push de grey who wa look on with a more good-natur and
more thought air friend said he you look like a great
philosoph and archer a great hero

and you townsend said archer may look like a wit if you will; but
you will never be a hero

no no repli townsend; wit were never hero becaus they are
wit you are out of your wit and therefor may set up for a hero

laugh and welcom im not a tyrant i dont want to restrain
anybodi wit; but i cannot say i admir pun

nor i either said the time serv fisher sidl up to the manag
and pick the ice off a piec of plum-cak nor i either; i hate pun
i can never understand townsend pun besid anybodi can make puns;
and one doesnt want wit either at all times; for instanc when one is

archer! continu he with sudden familiarity; what a sight of good
thing are here! im sure we are much oblig to you and your cousin i
never thought hed have come whi now we can hold out as long as you
pleas let us see said he divid the provis upon the table;
we can hold out to-day and all to-morrow and part of next day mayb

sure give up to us; for you see he know noth of all thi and
hell think we are starv all thi while; and hed be afraid you see
to let us starv quit in realiti for three whole day becaus of what
would be said in the town my aunt barbara for one would be at him
long befor that time wa out; and besid you know in that case hed
be hang for murder which is quit anoth thing in law from a
bar out you know

archer had not given to thi harangu all the attent which it
deserv for hi eye wa fix upon de grey what is de grey think
of? he ask impati

i am think said de grey that dr middleton must believ that i
have betray hi confid in me the garden wa order away from
hi watch-post for one half-hour when i wa admit thi half-hour the
garden ha made nearli a hour i never would have come near you if i
had foreseen all thi dr middleton trust me and now he will repent
of hi confid in me

de grey! cri archer with energi he shall not repent of hi
confid in you--nor shall you repent of come amongst us you shall
find that we have some honour as well as yourself and i will take care
of your honour as if it were my own!

hey-day! interrupt townsend; are hero allow to chang side
pray? and doe the chief of the archer stand talk sentiment to the
chief of the greybeards? in the middl of hi own parti too!

party! repeat archer disdainfully; i have done with parties! i see
what parti are made of! i have felt the want of a friend and i am
determin to make one if i can

that you may do said de grey stretch out hi hand

unbar the doors! unbar the windows! exclaim archer away with all
these things! i give up for de grey sake he shall not lose hi
credit on my account

no said de grey you shall not give up for my sake

well then ill give up to do what is honour said archer

whi not to do what is reasonable? said de grey

reasonable! oh the first thing that a man of spirit should think of
is what is honour

but how will he find out what is honour unless he can reason?
repli de grey

oh said archer hi own feel alway tell him what is honour

have not your feel ask de grey chang within these few
hours?

ye with circumst repli archer; but right or wrong as long
as i think it honour to do so and so im satisfi

but you cannot think anyth honour or the contrari observ de
grey without reasoning; and as to what you call feel it onli a
quick sort of reason

the quicker the better said archer

perhap not said de grey we are apt to reason best when we are not
in quit so great a hurri

but said archer we have not alway time enough to reason at first

you must howev acknowledg repli de grey smile that no man
but a fool think it honour to be in the wrong at last is it not
therefor best to begin by reason to find out the right at first?

to be sure said archer

and did you reason with yourself at first? and did you find out that it
wa right to bar dr middleton out of hi own schoolroom becaus he
desir you not to go into one of hi own houses?

no repli archer; but i should never have thought of head a
bar out if he had not shown partiality; and if you had flown into a
passion with me openli at onc for pull down your sceneri which would
have been quit natur and not have gone slili and forbid us the hous
out of reveng there would have been none of thi work

whi said de grey should you suspect me of such a mean action when
you have never seen or known me do anyth mean and when in thi
instanc you have no proofs?

will you give me your word and honour now de grey befor everybodi
here that you did not do what i suspected?

i do assur you upon my honour i never indirectli spoke to dr
middleton about the playhous

then said archer im as glad as if i had found a thousand pounds!
now you are my friend inde

and dr middleton--whi should you suspect him without reason ani more
than me?

as to that said archer he is your friend and you are right to
defend him; and i wont say anoth word against him will that satisfi
you?

not quit

not quite! then inde you are unreasonable!

no repli de grey; for i dont wish you to yield out of friendship
to me ani more than to honour if you yield to reason you will be
govern by reason anoth time

well; but then dont triumph over me becaus you have the best side of
the argument

not i! how can i? said de grey; for now you are on the best side as
well as myself are not you? so we may triumph togeth

you are a good friend! said archer; and with great eager he pull
down the fortif whilst everi hand assist the room wa
restor to order in a few minutes--th shutter were thrown open the
cheer light let in the window were thrown up and the first feel
of the fresh air wa delight the green playgound open befor them
and the hope of exercis and liberti brighten the counten of
these voluntari prison

but alas! they were not yet at liberti the idea of dr middleton and
the dread of hi vengeanc smote their heart when the rebel had sent
an ambassador with their surrend they stood in pale and silent
suspens wait for their doom

ah! said fisher look up at the broken pane in the window the
doctor will think the most of that--hel never forgiv us for that

hush! here he comes! hi steadi step wa heard approach nearer and
nearer archer threw open the door and dr middleton enter fisher
instantli fell on hi knee

it is no delight to me to see peopl on their knee stand up mr
fisher i hope you are all consciou that you have done wrong?

sir said archer they are consciou that they have done wrong and so
am i i am the ringlead punish me as you think proper i submit
your punishments--your vengeanc ought to fall on me alone!

sir said dr middleton calmli i perceiv that whatev els you may
have learn in the cours of your educ you have not been taught
the mean of the word punish punish and vengeanc do not with
us mean the same thing punish is pain given with the reason
hope of prevent those on whom it is inflict from do in futur
what will hurt themselv or other vengeanc never look to the
futur but is the express of anger for an injuri that is past i
feel no anger; you have done me no injuri

here mani of the littl boy look timidli up to the window ye i
see that you have broken my windows; that is a small evil

oh sir! how good! how merciful! exclaim those who had been most
panic-struck he forgiv us!

stay resum dr middleton; i cannot forgiv you i shall never
reveng but it is my duti to punish you have rebel against the just
author which is necessari to conduct and govern you whilst you have
not suffici reason to govern and conduct yourselv without
obedi to the law ad he turn to archer as men you cannot
be suffer in societi you sir think yourself a man i observe; and
you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of anoth i
have no pleasur in make other whether men or children submit to my
will; but my reason and experi are superior to your your parent
at least think so or they would not have intrust me with the care of
your educ as long as they do intrust you to my care and as long
as i have ani hope of make you wiser and better by punish i shall
steadili inflict it whenev i judg it to be necessari and i judg it
to be necessari now thi is a long sermon mr archer not preach to
show my own eloqu but to convinc your understand now as to
your punishment!

name it sir said archer; whatev it is i will cheer submit
to it

name it yourself said dr middleton and show me that you now
understand the natur of punish

archer proud to be treat like a reason creatur and sorri that he
had behav like a foolish schoolboy wa silent for some time but at
length repli that he would rather not name hi own punish he
repeat howev that he trust he should bear it well whatev it
might be

i shall then said dr middleton depriv you for two month of
pocket-money as you have had too much and have made a bad use of it

sir said archer i brought five guinea with me to school thi
guinea is all that i have left

dr middleton receiv the guinea which archer offer him with a look of
approb and told him that it should be appli to the repair of the
schoolroom the rest of the boy wait in silenc for the doctor
sentenc against them but not with those look of abject fear with which
boy usual expect the sentenc of a schoolmast

you shall return from the playground all of you said dr middleton
one quarter of an hour sooner for two month to come than the rest of
your companion a bell shall ring at the appoint time i give you an
opportun of recov my confid by your punctual

oh sir! we will come the instant the veri instant the bell rings; you
shall have confid in us cri they eagerli

i deserv your confid i hope said dr middleton; for it is my
first wish to make you all happi you do not know the pain that it ha
cost me to depriv you of food for so mani hour

here the boy with one accord ran to the place where they had deposit
their last suppli archer deliv them up to the doctor proud to
show that they were not reduc to obedi mere by necess

the reason resum dr middleton have now return to the usual
benign of hi manner--th reason whi i desir that none of you
should go to that build point out of the window wa this:--i
had been inform that a gang of gipsi had slept there the night befor
i spoke to you one of whom wa danger ill of a putrid fever i did
not choos to mention my reason to you or your friend i have had the
place clean and you may return to it when you pleas the gipsi
were yesterday remov from the town

de grey you were in the right whisper archer and it wa i that
wa unjust

the old woman continu the doctor whom you employ to buy food
ha escap the fever but she ha not escap a gaol whither she wa
sent yesterday for have defraud you of your money

mr fisher said dr middleton as to you i shall not punish you; i
have no hope of make you either wiser or better do you know thi
paper?--th paper appear to be a bill for candl and a tinder-box

i desir him to buy those thing sir said archer colour

and did you desir him not to pay for them?

no said archer he had half a crown on purpos to pay for them

i know he had but he chose to appli it to hi privat use and gave it
to the gipsi to buy twelv bun for hi own eat to obtain credit for
the tinder-box and candl he made use of thi name said he turn
to the other side of the bill and point to de grey name which wa
written at the end of a copi of one of de grey exercis

i assur you sir-- cri archer

you need not assur me sir said dr middleton; i cannot suspect a
boy of your temper of have ani part in so base an action when the
peopl in the shop refus to let mr fisher have the thing without
pay for them he made use of de grey name who wa known there
suspect some mischief howev from the purchas of the tinder-box
the shopkeep inform me of the circumst noth in thi whole
busi gave me half so much pain as i felt for a moment when i
suspect that de grey wa concern in it a loud cri in which
archer voic wa heard most distinctli declar de grey innoc
dr middleton look round at their eager honest face with benevol
approb archer said he take him by the hand i am heartili
glad to see that you have got the better of your parti spirit i wish
you may keep such a friend as you have now besid you; one such friend is
worth two such parti as for you mr fisher depart; you must never
return hither again in vain he solicit archer and de grey to
interced for him everybodi turn away with contempt; and he sneak
out whimper in a dole voic what shall i say to my aunt
barbara?



the bracelet

in a beauti and retir part of england live mr villar a ladi
whose accur understand benevol heart and steadi temper
peculiarli fit her for the most difficult as well as most import
of all occupations--th educ of youth thi task she had
undertaken; and twenti young person were put under her care with the
perfect confid of their parent no young peopl could be happier;
they were good and gay emul but not enviou of each other; for mr
villar wa imparti just; her prais they felt to be the reward of
merit and her blame they knew to be the necessari consequ of ill-
conduct to the one therefor they patient submit and in the
other conscious rejoic they rose with fresh cheer in the
morn eager to pursu their variou occup they return in the
even with renew ardour to their amus and retir to rest
satisfi with themselv and pleas with each other

noth so much contribut to preserv a spirit of emul in thi
littl societi as a small honorari distinct given annual as a
prize of success applic the prize thi year wa peculiarli dear
to each individu as it wa the pictur of a friend whom they dearli
love it wa the pictur of mr villar in a small bracelet it
want neither gold pearl nor preciou stone to give it valu

the two foremost candid for thi prize were cecilia and leonora
cecilia wa the most intim friend of leonora; but leonora wa onli the
favourit companion of cecilia

cecilia wa of an activ ambiti enterpris disposit more eager
in the pursuit than happi in the enjoy of her wish leonora wa of
a content unaspir temper character; not easili rous to action
but indefatig when onc excit leonora wa proud; cecilia wa
vain her vaniti made her more depend upon the approb of other
and therefor more anxiou to pleas than leonora; but that veri vaniti
made her at the same time more apt to offend in short leonora wa
the most anxiou to avoid what wa wrong; cecilia the most ambiti to
do what wa right few of her companion love but mani were led by
cecilia for she wa often success mani love leonora but none were
ever govern by her for she wa too indol to govern

on the first day of may about six oclock in the even a great bell
rang to summon thi littl societi into a hall where the prize wa to
be decid a number of small tabl were place in a circl in the
middl of the hall seat for the young competitor were rais one

joy in the moment of triumph command yourselv let that triumph be
moder that it may be last consid that though you are good

as soon as mr villar had given her the bracelet all cecilia littl
companion crowd round her and they all left the hall in an instant
she wa full of spirit and vaniti she ran on run down the flight
of step which led to the garden in her violent hast cecilia threw
down the littl louisa who had a china mandarin in her hand which her
mother had sent her that veri morn and which wa all broken to piec

shoulder and roll bound along the gravel walk cecilia point
to the head and to the socket and burst into laughter the crowd behind

at ani other time they would have been more inclin to cri with louisa;
but cecilia had just been success and sympathi with the victori
often make us forget justic

leonora howev preserv her usual consist poor louisa! said
she look first at her and then reproach at cecilia cecilia
turn sharpli round colour half with shame and half with vexat
i could not help it leonora said she

but you could have help laugh cecilia

i didnt laugh at louisa; and i sure may laugh for it doe nobodi ani
harm

i am sure howev repli leonora i should not have laugh if i
had--

no to be sure you wouldnt becaus louisa is your favourit i can
buy her anoth mandarin when the old peddler come to the door if
that all i can do no more can i? said she again turn round to
her companion no to be sure said they; that all fair

cecilia look triumphantli at leonora leonora let go her hand; she ran
on and the crowd follow when she got to the end of the garden she
turn round to see if leonora had follow her too; but wa vex to
see her still sit on the step with louisa im sure i can do no
more than buy her anoth can i! said she again appeal to her
companion no to be sure said they eager to begin their play

how mani game did these juvenil playmat begin and leav off befor
cecilia could be satisfi with any! her thought were discompos and
her mind wa run upon someth els no wonder then that she did
not play with her usual address she grew still more impati she
threw down the ninepin come let us play at someth else--at
thread the needl said she hold out her hand they all yield
to the hand which wore the bracelet but cecilia dissatisfi with
herself wa discont with everybodi els her tone grew more and
more peremptori one wa too rude anoth too stiff; one too slow
anoth too quick; in short everyth went wrong and everybodi wa
tire of her humour

the triumph of success is absolut but short cecilia companion at
length recollect that though she had embroid a tulip and paint a
peach better than they yet that they could play as well and keep their
temper better; for she wa discompos

walk toward the hous in a peevish mood cecilia met leonora but
pass on cecilia! cri leonora

you know best said cecilia

we are if you will let me tell louisa that you are sorry--

cecilia interrupt her oh pray let me hear no more about louisa!

what! not confess that you were in the wrong? oh cecilia! i had a
better opinion of you

your opinion is of no consequ to me now for you dont love me

no; not when you are unjust cecilia

unjust! i am not unjust; and if i were you are not my gover

no but am not i your friend?

i dont desir to have such a friend who would quarrel with me for
happen to throw down littl louisa how could i tell that she had a
mandarin in her hand? and when it wa broken could i do more than
promis her another; wa that unjust?

but you know cecilia--

i know iron i know leonora that you love louisa better than
you love me; that the injustice!

if i did repli leonora grave it would be no injustic if she
deserv it better

how can you compar louisa to me! exclaim cecilia indignantli

leonora made no answer; for she wa realli hurt at her friend conduct
she walk on to join the rest of her companion they were danc in a
round upon the grass leonora declin dancing; but they prevail upon
her to sing for them her voic wa not so sprightli but it wa sweeter
than usual who sang so sweetli as leonora? or who danc so nimbl as
louisa? away she wa fli all spirit and gaieti when leonora eye
full of tear caught her louisa silent let go her companion hand
and quit the danc ran up to leonora to inquir what wa the matter
with her noth repli she that need interrupt you go my
dear; go and danc again

louisa immedi ran away to her garden and pull off her littl
straw hat she line it with the freshest strawberry-leav and wa upon
her knee befor the strawberry-b when cecilia came by cecilia wa
not dispos to be pleas with louisa at that instant for two reasons;
becaus she wa jealou of her and becaus she had injur her the
injuri howev louisa had alreadi forgotten perhap to tell thing
just as they were she wa not quit so much inclin to kiss cecilia as
she would have been befor the fall of her mandarin; but thi wa the
utmost extent of her malic if it can be call malic

what are you do there littl one? said cecilia in a sharp tone
are you eat your earli strawberri here all alone?

no said louisa mysteri i am not eat them

what are you do with them? cant you answer then? im not play
with you child!

oh as to that cecilia you know i need not answer you unless i choos
it; not but what i would if you would onli ask me civilli and if you
would not call me child

whi should not i call you child?

because--because--i dont know; but i wish you would stand out of my
light cecilia for you are trampl upon all my strawberri

i have not touch one you covet littl creature!

indeed--inde cecilia i am not covet i have not eaten one of
them; they are all for your friend leonora see how unjust you are!

unjust! that a cant word which you learnt of my friend leonora as you
call her; but she is not my friend now

not your friend now! exclaim louisa; then i am sure you must have
done someth veri naughti

how? cri cecilia catch hold of her

let me go let me go! cri louisa struggl i wont give you one
of my strawberri for i dont like you at all!

you dont dont you? cri cecilia provok and catch the hat
from louisa she flung the strawberri over the hedg

will nobodi help me? exclaim louisa snatch her hat again and
run away with all her forc

what have i done? said cecilia recollect herself; louisa! louisa!
she call veri loud but louisa would not turn back; she wa run to
her companion who were still danc hand in hand upon the grass
whilst leonora sit in the middl wa sing to them

stop! stop! and hear me! cri louisa break through them; and
rush up to leonora she threw her hat at her feet and pant for
breath--it wa full--almost full of my own strawberri said she the
first i ever got out of my garden they should all have been for you
leonora; but now i have not one left they are all gone! said she; and
she hid her face in leonora lap

gone! gone where? said everyon at onc run up to her

cecilia! cecilia! said she sob

cecilia repeat leonora what of cecilia?

ye it was--it wa

come with me said leonora unwil to have her friend expos
come and i will get you some more strawberri

oh i dont mind the strawberri indeed; but i want to have had the
pleasur of give them to you

leonora took her up in her arm to carri her away but it wa too late

what cecilia! cecilia who won the prize! it could not sure be
cecilia whisper everi busi tongu

at thi instant the bell summon them in there she is! there she
is! cri they point to an arbour where cecilia wa stand
asham and alone; and as they pass her some lift up their hand
and eye with astonish other whisper and huddl mysteri
togeth as if to avoid her leonora walk on her head a littl
higher than usual

leonora! said cecilia timor as she pass

oh cecilia! who would have thought that you had a bad heart? cecilia
turn her head asid and burst into tear

oh no inde she ha not a bad heart! cri louisa run up to
her and throw her arm around her neck she veri sorry; are not
you cecilia? but dont cri ani more for i forgiv you with all my
heart--and i love you now though i said i did not when i wa in a
passion

oh you sweet-temp girl! how i love you! said cecilia kiss her

well then if you do come along with me and dri your eye for they
are so red!

go my dear and ill come present

then i will keep a place for you next to me; but you must make hast
or you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper and then
you will be so stare at! so dont stay now

cecilia follow louisa with her eye till she wa out of sight and is
louisa said she to herself the onli one who would stop to piti me?
mr villar told me that thi day should be mine she littl thought
how it would end!

say these word cecilia threw herself down upon the ground; her arm
lean upon a heap of turf which she had rais in the morn and
which in the pride and gaieti of her heart she had call her throne

at thi instant mr villar came out to enjoy the seren of the
even and pass by the arbour where cecilia lay she start
cecilia rose hastili

who is there? said mr villar

it is i madam

and who is _i_?

cecilia

whi what keep you here my dear? where are your companions? thi is
perhap one of the happiest day of your life

oh no madam said cecilia hardli abl to repress her tear

whi my dear what is the matter? cecilia hesit speak my dear
you know that when i ask you to tell me anyth as your friend i never
punish you as your governess; therefor you need not be afraid to tell me
what is the matter

no madam i am not afraid but asham you ask me whi i wa not
with my companion whi madam becaus they have all left me and--

and what my dear?

and i see that they all dislik me; and yet i dont know whi they
should for i take as much pain to pleas as ani of them all my
master seem satisfi with me; and you yourself madam were pleas
thi veri morn to give me thi bracelet; and i am sure you would not
have given it to anyon who did not deserv it

certainli not said mr villar you well deserv it for your
application--for your success applic the prize wa for the most
assidu not for the most amiabl

then if it had been for the most amiabl it would not have been for
me?

mr villar smiling--whi what do you think yourself cecilia? you
are better abl to judg than i am i can determin whether or no you
appli to what i give you to learn; whether you attend to what i desir
you to do and avoid what i desir you not to do i know that i like you
as a pupil but i cannot know that i should like you as a companion
unless i were your companion therefor i must judg of what i should
do by see what other do in the same circumst

oh pray dont madam! for then you would not love me either and yet i
think you would love me; for i hope that i am as readi to oblig and as
good-natur as--

ye cecilia i dont doubt but that you would be veri good natur to
me; but im afraid that i should not like you unless you were good-
temper too

but madam by good-natur i mean good-tempered--it all the same
thing

no inde i understand by them two veri differ thing you are
good-natur cecilia; for you are desir to oblig and serv your
companions--to gain them prais and save them from blame--to give them
pleasur and reliev them from pain; but leonora is good-temp for
she can bear with their foibl and acknowledg her own without
disput about the right she sometim yield to those who are in the
wrong in short her temper is perfectli good; for it can bear and
forbear

i wish that mine could! said cecilia sigh

it may repli mr villars; but it is not wish alon which can
improv us in anyth turn the same exert and persever which
have won you the prize to-day to thi object and you will meet with the
same success; perhap not on the first the second or the third attempt;
but depend upon it that you will at last everi new effort will weaken
your bad habit and strengthen your good one but you must not expect
to succeed all at onc i repeat it to you for habit must be
counteract by habit it would be as extravag in us to expect that
all our fault could be destroy by one punish were it ever so
sever as it wa in the roman emperor we were read of a few day ago
to wish that all the head of hi enemi were upon one neck that he
might cut them off at one blow

here mr villar took cecilia by the hand and they began to walk home
such wa the natur of cecilia mind that when ani object wa forcibl
impress on her imagin it caus a temporari suspens of her
reason faculti hope wa too strong a stimulu for her spirits; and
when fear did take possess of her mind it wa attend with total
debil her vaniti wa now as much mortifi as in the morn it had
been elat she walk on with mr villar in silenc until they came
under the shade of the elm-tre walk and there fix her eye upon
mr villar she stop short

do you think madam said she with hesitation--do you think madam
that i have a bad heart?

a bad heart--mi dear! whi what put that into your head?

leonora said that i had madam and i felt asham when she said so

but my dear how can leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad?
howev in the first place tell me what you mean by a bad heart

inde i do not know what is meant by it madam; but it is someth
which everybodi hate

and whi do they hate it?

becaus they think that it will hurt them maam i believe: and that
those who have bad heart take delight in do mischief; and that they
never do anybodi ani good but for their own end

then the best definit said mr villar which you can give me of
a bad heart is that it is some constant propens to hurt other and
to do wrong for the sake of do wrong

ye madam; but that is not all either there is still someth els
meant; someth which i cannot express--which inde i never
distinctli understood; but of which therefor i wa the more afraid

well then to begin with what you do understand tell me cecilia do
you realli think it possibl to be wick mere for the love of
wickedness? no human be becom wick all at onc a man begin by
do wrong becaus it is or becaus he think it for hi interest if
he continu to do so he must conquer hi sens of shame and lose hi
love of virtu but how can you cecilia who feel such a strong sens
of shame and such an eager desir to improv imagin that you have a
bad heart?

inde madam i never did until everybodi told me so and then i began
to be frighten about it thi veri even madam when i wa in a
passion i threw littl louisa strawberri away which i am sure i
wa veri sorri for afterwards; and leonora and everybodi cri out that i
had a bad heart--but i am sure i wa onli in a passion

veri like and when you are in a passion as you call it cecilia
you see that you are tempt to do harm to other if they do not feel
angri themselv they do not sympath with you they do not perceiv
the motiv which actuat you; and then they say that you have a bad
heart i daresay howev when your passion is over and when you
recollect yourself you are veri sorri for what you have done and said;
are not you?

ye inde madam--veri sorri

then make that sorri of use to you cecilia and fix it steadili in your
thought as you hope to be good and happi that if you suffer yourself
to yield to your passion upon everi occas anger and it consequ
will becom familiar to your mind; and in the same proport your
sens of shame will be weaken till what you began with do from
sudden impuls you will end with do from habit and choice: then you
would inde accord to our definit have a bad heart

oh madam! i hope--i am sure i never shall

no inde cecilia; i do inde believ that you never will; on the
contrari i think that you have a veri good disposit and what is of
infinit more consequ to you an activ desir of improv
show me that you have as much persever as you have candour and i
shall not despair of your becom everyth that i could wish

here cecilia counten brighten and she ran up the step in almost
as high spirit as she ran down them in the morn

good-night to you cecilia said mr villar as she wa cross the
hall good-night to you madam said cecilia; and she ran upstair to
bed she could not go to sleep; but she lay awak reflect upon the
event of the preced day and form resolut for the futur at
the same time that she had resolv and resolv without effect she
wish to give her mind some more power motiv ambit she knew to
be it most power incent have i not said she to herself
alreadi won the prize of applic and cannot the same applic
procur me a much higher prize? mr villar said that if the prize had
been promis to the most amiabl it would not have been given to me
perhap it would not yesterday perhap it might not to-morrow; but that
is no reason that i should despair of ever deserv it

in consequ of thi reason cecilia form a design of propos to
her companion that they should give a prize the first of the ensu
month (the lst of june) to the most amiabl mr villar applaud the
scheme and her companion adopt it with the greatest alacr

let the prize said they be a bracelet of our own hair; and
instantli their shine scissor were produc and each contribut a
lock of their hair they form the most beauti gradat of colour
from the palest auburn to the brightest black who wa to have the
honour of plait them? wa now the question carolin beg that she
might as she could plait veri neatli she said cecilia howev wa
equal sure that she could do it much better; and a disput would have
inevit ensu if cecilia recollect herself just as her colour
rose to scarlet had not yielded--yield with no veri good grace
inde but as well as could be expect for the first time for it is
habit which confer ease; and without eas even in moral action there
can be no grace

the bracelet wa plait in the neatest manner by carolin finish
round the edg with silver twist and on it wa work in the smallest
silver letter thi motto to the most amiabl the moment it wa
complet everybodi beg to tri it on it fasten with littl silver
clasp and as it wa made larg enough for the eldest girl it wa too
larg for the youngest of thi they bitterli complain and
unanim entreat that it might be cut to fit them

how foolish! exclaim cecilia; dont you perceiv that if ani of you
win it you have noth to do but to put the clip a littl further from
the edg but if we get it we cant make it larger?

veri true said they; but you need not to have call us foolish
cecilia

it wa by such hasti and unguard express as these that cecilia
offend a slight differ in the manner make a veri materi one in
the effect cecilia lost more love by gener petul than she could
gain by the greatest particular exert

how far she succeed in cure herself of thi defect--how far she
becam deserv of the bracelet and to whom the bracelet wa given--
shall be told in the histori of the first of june

-----

the first of june wa now arriv and all the young competitor were in
a state of the most anxiou suspens leonora and cecilia continu to
be the foremost candid their quarrel had never been final
adjust and their differ pretens now retard all thought of a
reconcili cecilia though she wa capabl of acknowledg ani of
her fault in public befor all her companion could not humbl herself
in privat to leonora leonora wa her equal; they were her inferior
and submiss is much easier to a vain mind where it appear to be
voluntari than when it is the necessari tribut to justic or candour
so strongli did cecilia feel thi truth that she even delay make ani
apolog or come to ani explan with leonora until success should
onc more give her the palm

if i win the bracelet to-day said she to herself i will solicit the
return of leonora friendship; it will be more valuabl to me than even
the bracelet and at such a time and ask in such a manner she sure
cannot refus it to me anim with thi hope of a doubl triumph
cecilia canvass with the most zealou activ by constant attent
and exert she had consider abat the violenc of her temper and
chang the cours of her habit her power of pleas were now
excit instead of her abil to excel; and if her talent appear
less brilliant her charact wa acknowledg to be more amiabl so
great an influenc upon our manner and conduct have the object of our
ambit

cecilia wa now if possibl more than ever desir of do what wa
right but she had not yet acquir suffici fear of do wrong thi
wa the fundament error of her mind; it aros in a great measur from
her earli educ her mother die when she wa veri young; and though
her father had suppli her place in the best and kindest manner he had
insens infus into hi daughter mind a portion of that
enterpris independ spirit which he justli deem essenti to the
charact of her brother thi brother wa some year older than
cecilia but he had alway been the favourit companion of her youth
what her father precept inculc hi exampl enforced; and even
cecilia virtu consequ becam such as were more estim in a
man than desir in a femal all small object and small error she
had been taught to disregard as trifles; and her impati disposit
wa perpetu lead her into more materi faults; yet her candour in
confess these she had been suffer to believ wa suffici
repar and aton

leonora on the contrari who had been educ by her mother in a manner
more suit to her sex had a charact and virtu more peculiar to a
femal her judgment had been earli cultiv and her good sens
employ in the regul of her conduct she had been habitu to
that restraint which as a woman she wa to expect in life and earli
accustom to yield complianc in her seem natur and graceful; yet
notwithstand the gentl of her temper she wa in realiti more
independ than cecilia she had more relianc upon her own judgment
and more satisfact in her own approb the uniform kind of
her manner the consist and equal of her charact had fix the
esteem and passiv love of her companion

by passiv love we mean that speci of affect which make us
unwil to offend rather than anxiou to oblig which is more a habit
than an emot of the mind for cecilia her companion felt activ
love for she wa activ in show her love to them

activ love aris spontan in the mind after feel particular
instanc of kind without reflect on the past conduct or gener
charact it exce the merit of it object and is connect with a
feel of generos rather than with a sens of justic

without determin which speci of love is the most flatter to
other we can easili decid which is the most agreeabl feel to our
mind we give our heart more credit for be gener than for be
just; and we feel more self-complac when we give our love
voluntarili than when we yield it as a tribut which we cannot withhold
though cecilia companion might not know all thi in theori they
prove it in practice; for they love her in a much higher proport to
her merit than they love leonora

each of the young judg were to signifi their choic by put a red or
a white shell into a vase prepar for the purpos cecilia colour wa
red leonora white

in the morn noth wa to be seen but these shells; noth talk of
but the long expect event of the even cecilia follow leonora
exampl had made it a point of honour not to inquir of ani individu
her vote previous to their final determin

they were both sit togeth in louisa room louisa wa recov
from the measl everyon dure her ill had been desir of
attend her; but leonora and cecilia were the onli two that were
permit to see her as they alon had had the distemp they were
both assidu in their care of louisa but leonora want of exert to
overcom ani disagre feel of sensibl often depriv her of
presenc of mind and prevent her from be so constantli use as
cecilia cecilia on the contrari often made too much nois and bustl
with her offici assist and wa too anxiou to invent amus
and procur comfort for louisa without perceiv that ill take
away the power of enjoy them

as she wa sit at the window in the morn exert herself to
entertain louisa she heard the voic of an old peddler who often use to
come to the hous downstair they ran immedi to ask mr villar
permiss to bring him into the hall mr villar consent and away
cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companion then first
return into the hall she found the peddler just unbuckl hi box
and take it off hi shoulder

what would you be pleas to want miss? said the peddler; ive all
kind of tweezer-cas ring and locket of all sort continu he
open all the glitter drawer success

oh! said cecilia shut the drawer of locket which tempt her
most these are not the thing which i want have you ani china
figures? ani mandarins?

alack-a-day miss i had a great stock of that same chinaware; but now
im quit out of them kind of things; but i believ said he rummag
one of the deepest drawer i believ i have one left and here it is

oh that is the veri thing! what it price?

onli three shill maam cecilia paid the money and wa just
go to carri off the mandarin when the peddler took out of hi great-
coat pocket a neat mahogani case it wa about a foot long and fasten
at each end by two littl clasp it had besid a small lock in the
middl

what is that? said cecilia eagerli

it onli a china figur miss which i am go to carri to an elderli
ladi who live nigh hand and who is mighti fond of such thing

could you let me look at it?

and welcom miss said he and open the case

oh goodness! how beautiful! exclaim cecilia

it wa a figur of flora crown with rose and carri a basket of
flower in her hand cecilia contempl it with delight how i
should like to give thi to louisa! said she to herself; and at last
break silenc did you promis it to the old lady?

oh no miss i didnt promis it--sh never saw it; and if so be that
youd like to take it id make no more word about it

and how much doe it cost?

whi miss as to that ill let you have it for half-a-guinea

cecilia immedi produc the box in which she kept her treasur and
empti it upon the tabl she began to count the shill alas!
there were but six shill how provoking! said she; then i cant
have it where the mandarin? oh i have it said she take it up
and look at it with the utmost disgust is thi the same that i had
before?

ye miss the veri same repli the peddler who dure thi time
had been examin the littl box out of which cecilia had taken her
money--it wa of silver whi maam said he sinc youv taken such
a fanci to the piec if youv a mind to make up the remaind of the
money i will take thi here littl box if you care to part with it

now thi box wa a keepsak from leonora to cecilia no said cecilia
hastili blush a littl and stretch out her hand to receiv it

oh miss! said he return it carelessli i hope there no offenc
i meant but to serv you that all such a rare piec of china-work
ha no caus to go a-beg ad he then put the flora
deliber into the case and turn the key with a jerk he let it
drop into hi pocket; when lift up hi box by the leather strap he
wa prepar to depart

oh stay one minute! said cecilia in whose mind there had pass a
veri warm conflict dure the peddler harangu louisa would so like
thi flora said she argu with herself besid it would be so
gener in me to give it to her instead of that ugli mandarin; that
would be do onli common justic for i promis it to her and she
expect it though when i come to look at thi mandarin it is not even
so good as her wa the gild is all rub off so that i absolut
must buy thi for her oh yes! i will and she will be so delighted!
and then everybodi will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw and
the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever

here cecilia hand move and she wa just go to decide: oh but
stop said she to herself consider--leonora gave me thi box and it
is a keepsak howev we have now quarrel and i dare say that she
would not mind my part with it im sure that i should not care if
she wa to give away my keepsak the smelling-bottl or the ring which
i gave her then what doe it signify? besid is it not my own? and
have i not a right to do what i pleas with it?

at thi moment so critic for cecilia a parti of her companion open
the door she knew that they came as purchas and she dread her
flora becom the prize of some higher bidder here said she
hastili put the box into the peddler hand without look at it;
take it and give me the flora her hand trembl though she snatch
it impati she ran by without seem to mind ani of her
companion

let those who are tempt to do wrong by the hope of futur
gratif or the prospect of certain conceal and impun
rememb that unless they are total deprav they bear in their own
heart a monitor who will prevent their enjoy what they ill obtain

in vain cecilia ran to the rest of her companion to display her
present in hope that the applaus of other would restor her own self-
complacency; in vain she saw the flora pass in due pomp from hand to
hand each vy with the other in extol the beauti of the gift and
the generos of the giver cecilia wa still displeas with herself
with them and even with their prais from louisa gratitud howev
she yet expect much pleasur and immedi she ran upstair to her
room

in the meantim leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin; she had
just broken her in give her chang the peddler took out of hi
pocket with some halfpenc the veri box which cecilia had sold to him
leonora did not in the least suspect the truth for her mind wa abov
suspicion; and besid she had the utmost confid in cecilia

needl and cecilia scold me for it too do go and ask her if she ha
lost her box--do repeat louisa pull her by the ruffl as she did
not seem to listen

leonora inde did not hear for she wa lost in thought she wa

recollect that cecilia had pass her as she came into the hall
without seem to see her but had blush as she pass she
rememb that the peddler appear unwil to part with the box and
wa go to put it again in hi pocket with the halfpenc and whi
should he keep it in hi pocket and not show it with hi other things?
combin all these circumst leonora had no longer ani doubt of the
truth for though she had honour confid in her friend she had
too much penetr to be implicitli credul

louisa she began but at thi instant she heard a step which by it
quick she knew to be cecilia come along the passag if you
love me louisa said leonora say noth about the box

no my dear im afraid she ha not louisa look surpris but i

what a beauti crown of roses! and then that basket of flowers! they
almost look as if i could smell them dear cecilia im veri much

have broken it myself by thi time you shall give it to me entirely;
and as your keepsak ill keep it as long as i live

louisa stop short and coloured; the word keepsak recal the box to
her mind and all the train of idea which the flora had banish
but said she look up wist in cecilia face and hold the
flora doubt did you--

leonora who wa just quit the room turn her head back and gave
louisa a look which silenc her

cecilia wa so infatu with her vaniti that she neither perceiv
leonora sign nor louisa confus but continu show off her
present by place it in variou situat till at length she put it
into the case and lay it down with an affect careless upon the
bed i must go now louisa good-by said she run up and kiss
her; but ill come again present then clap the door after her
she went but as soon as the forment of her spirit subsid the
sens of shame which had been scarc felt when mix with so mani
other sensat rose uppermost in her mind what! said she to
herself is it possibl that i have sold what i promis to keep for
ever? and what leonora gave me? and i have conceal it too and have
been make a parad of my generos oh! what would leonora what
would louisa--what would everybodi think of me if the truth were known?

humili and griev by these reflect cecilia began to search in
her own mind for some consol idea she began to compar her conduct
with that of other of her own age; and at length fix her comparison
upon her brother georg as the companion of whom from her infanc she
had been habitu the most emul she recollect that an almost
similar circumst had onc happen to him and that he had not onli
escap disgrac but had acquir glori by an intrepid confess of
hi fault her father word to her brother on the occas she also
perfectli recollect

come to me georg he said hold out hi hand you are a gener
brave boy: they who dare to confess their fault will make great and
good men

these were hi words; but cecilia in repeat them to herself forgot
to lay that emphasi on the word men which would have place it in
contradistinct to the word women she willingli believ that the
observ extend equal to both sex and flatter herself that
she should exceed her brother in merit if she own a fault which she
thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess ye but
said she stop herself how can i confess it? thi veri even in
a few hour the prize will be decid leonora or i shall win it i
have now as good a chanc as leonora perhap a better; and must i give
up all my hopes--al that i have been labour for thi month past? oh
i never can! if it were but to-morrow or yesterday or ani day but
thi i would not hesitate; but now i am almost certain of the prize and
if i win it--wel whi then i will--i think i will tell all--y i will;
i am determin said cecilia

here a bell summon them to dinner leonora sat opposit to her and
she wa not a littl surpris to see cecilia look so gay and
unconstrain sure said she to herself if cecilia had done that
which i suspect she would not she could not look as she doe but
leonora littl knew the caus of her gaieti cecilia wa never in higher
spirit or better pleas with herself than when she had resolv upon
a sacrific or a confess

must not thi even be given to the most amiable? whose then will
it be? all eye glanc first at cecilia and then at leonora cecilia
smiled; leonora blush i see that it is not yet decid said mr
villars; and immedi they ran upstair amidst confus whisper

cecilia voic could be distinguish far abov the rest how can she
be so happy! said leonora to herself oh cecilia there wa a time
when you could not have neglect me so! when we were alway togeth the
best of friend and companions; our wish tast and pleasur the
same! sure she did onc love me said leonora; but now she is quit
chang she ha even sold my keepsake; and she would rather win a
bracelet of hair from girl whom she did not alway think so much
superior to leonora than have my esteem my confid and my
friendship for her whole life--y for her whole life for i am sure she
will be an amiabl woman oh that thi bracelet had never been thought
of or that i were certain of her win it; for i am sure that i do not
wish to win it from her i would rather--a thousand time rather--that
we were as we use to be than have all the glori in the world and how
pleas cecilia can be when she wish to please!--how candid she is!--
how much she can improv herself! let me be just though she ha
offend me; she is wonder improv within thi last month for one
fault and that against myself shall i forget all her merits?

as leonora said these last word she could but just hear the voic of
her companion they had left her alon in the galleri she knock
softli at louisa door come in said louisa; im not asleep oh
said she start up with the flora in her hand the instant that the
door wa opened; im so glad you are come leonora for i did so long to
hear what you all were make such a nois about have you forgot that
the bracelet--

oh yes! is thi the evening? inquir leonora

well here my white shell for you said louisa ive kept it in my
pocket thi fortnight; and though cecilia did give me thi flora i still
love you a great deal better

i thank you louisa said leonora grate i will take your
shell and i shall valu it as long as i live; but here is a red one and
if you wish to show me that you love me you will give thi to cecilia
i know that she is particularli anxiou for your prefer and i am
sure that she deserv it

ye if i could i would choos both of you said louisa but you know
i can onli choos which i like the best

if you mean my dear louisa said leonora that you like me the best
i am veri much oblig to you for inde i wish you to love me; but it
is enough for me to know it in privat i should not feel the least more
pleasur at hear it in public or in have it made known to all my
companion especi at a time when it would give poor cecilia a great
deal of pain

but whi should it give her pain? ask louisa; i dont like her for
be jealou of you

nay louisa sure you dont think cecilia jealous? she onli tri to
excel and to please; she is more anxiou to succeed than i am it is
true becaus she ha a great deal more activ and perhap more
ambit and it would realli mortifi her to lose thi prize--y know
that she propos it herself it ha been her object for thi month
past and i am sure she ha taken great pain to obtain it

but dear leonora whi should you lose it?

inde my dear it would be no loss to me; and if it were i would
willingli suffer it for cecilia; for though we seem not to be such good
friend as we use to be i love her veri much and she will love me
again--im sure she will; when she no longer fear me as a rival she
will again love me as a friend

here leonora heard a number of her companion run along the galleri
they all knock hastili at the door call leonora! leonora! will you
never come? cecilia ha been with us thi half-hour

leonora smile well louisa said she smile will you promis
me?

oh i am sure by the way they speak to you that they wont give you
the prize! said the littl louisa and the tear start into her eye
they love me though for all that said leonora; and as for the
prize you know whom i wish to have it

leonora! leonora! call her impati companions; dont you hear us?
what are you about?

oh she never will take ani troubl about anyth said one of the
party; let go away

oh go go! make haste! cri louisa; dont stay; they are so angri

rememb then that you have promis me said leonora and she left
the room

dure all thi time cecilia had been in the garden with her companion
the ambit which she had felt to win the first prize--th prize of
superior talent and superior application--wa not to be compar to the
absolut anxieti which she now express to win thi simpl testimoni of
the love and approb of her equal and rival

to employ her exuber activ cecilia had been drag branch of
lilac and laburnum rose and sweet briar to ornament the bower in
which her fate wa to be decid it wa excess hot but her mind
wa engag and she wa indefatig she stood still at last to

not a littl prejud in her favour by the great eager which she
express to win their prize and by the great import which she
seem to affix to the prefer of each individu at last where is

to call her

cecilia wa left alon overcom with heat and too violent exert she
had hardli strength to support herself; each moment appear to her
intoler long she wa in a state of the utmost suspens and all her
courag fail her even hope forsook her; and hope is a cordial which
leav the mind depress and enfeebl

the time is now come said cecilia; in a few moment all will be

leonora to forgiv me? i who hope to restor my friendship to her as

besid i would not have cecilia think i vote for her becaus she gave
me a flora whilst louisa wa speak continu mr villar i saw
thi silver box lie on the bed i took it up and ask if it wa not
your and how she came by it inde madam said louisa i could
have been almost certain that it wa cecilias; but leonora gave it me
and she said that she bought it of the peddler thi morn if anybodi
els had told me so i could not have believ them becaus i rememb
the box so well; but i cant help believ leonora but did not you
ask cecilia about it? said i no madam repli louisa; for leonora
forbad me i guess her reason well said i give me the box and i
will carri your shell in it to cecilia then madam said she if i
must give it her pray do take the flora and return it to her first
that she may not think it is for that i do it

take your shell

then dear cecilia accept of mine instead of it! you cannot refus it;
i onli follow your exampl as for the bracelet ad leonora take
cecilia hand i assur you i dont wish for it and you do and you
deserv it

no said cecilia inde i do not deserv it next to you sure
louisa deserv it best

louisa! oh ye louisa exclaim everybodi with one voic

ye said mr villar and let cecilia carri the bracelet to her; she
deserv that reward for one fault i cannot forget all your merit

rather wish cecilia interrupt mr villar to be as just; to be
as strictli honour and as invari consist rememb that
mani of our sex are capabl of great efforts--of make what they call
great sacrific to virtu or to friendship; but few treat their friend
with habitu gentl or uniformli conduct themselv with prudenc
and good sens



the littl merchant



chapter i

chi di gallina nasc convien che rozol
as the old cock crow so crow the young

those who have visit itali give us an agreeabl pictur of the cheer
industri of the children of all age in the celebr citi of napl
their manner of live and their numer employ are exactli
describ in the follow extract from a travel journal *

* varieti of literatur vol i p 299

the children are busi in variou way a great number of them bring
fish for sale to town from santa lucia; other are veri often seen about
the arsen or wherev carpent are at work employ in gather
up the chip and piec of wood; or by the sea-sid pick up stick
and whatev els ha drift ashor which when their basket is full
they carri away

children of two or three year old who can scarc crawl along upon
the ground in compani with boy of five or six are employ in thi
pretti trade henc they proceed with their basket into the heart of
the citi where in sever place they form a sort of littl market
sit round with their stock of wood befor them labour and the
lower order of citizen buy it of them to burn in the tripod for
warm themselv or to use in their scanti kitchen

other children carri about for sale the water of the sulphur well
which particularli in the spring season is drunk in great abund
other again endeavour to turn a few penc by buy a small matter of
fruit of press honey cake and comfit and then like littl
peddler offer and sell them to other children alway for no more
profit than that they may have their share of them free of expens

it is realli curiou to see how an urchin whose whole stock and
properti consist in a board and a knife will carri about a water-melon
or a half roast gourd collect a troup of children round him set down
hi board and proceed to divid the fruit into small piec among them

the buyer keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their
littl piec of copper; and the lilliputian tradesmen act with no less
caution as the exig of the case may requir to prevent hi be
cheat out of a morsel

the advantag of truth and honesti and the valu of a charact for
integr are veri earli felt amongst these littl merchant in their
daili intercours with each other the fair dealer is alway sooner or
later seen to prosper the most cun cheat is at last detect and
disgrac

numer instanc of the truth of thi common observ were remark
by mani neapolitan children especi by those who were acquaint with
the charact and histori of piedro and francisco two boy origin
equal in birth fortun and capac but differ in their educ
and consequ in their habit and conduct francisco wa the son of
an honest garden who from the time he could speak taught him to love
to speak the truth show him that liar are never believed--that cheat
and thiev cannot be trust and that the shortest way to obtain a good
charact is to deserv it

youth and white paper as the proverb say take all impress the
boy profit much by hi father precept and more by hi example; he
alway heard hi father speak the truth and saw that he dealt fairli
with everybodi in all hi childish traffic francisco imit hi
parent wa scrupul honest and therefor all hi companion
trust him--a honest as francisco becam a sort of proverb amongst
them

as honest as francisco repeat piedro father when he one day heard
thi say let them say so; i say as sharp as piedro; and let us
see which will go through the world best with the idea of make hi
son sharp he made him cun he taught him that to make a good
bargain wa to deceiv as to the valu and price of whatev he want to
dispos of; to get as much money as possibl from custom by take
advantag of their ignor or of their confid he often repeat
hi favourit proverb--th buyer ha need of a hundr eyes; the seller
ha need but of one * and he took frequent opportun of explain
the mean of thi maxim to hi son he wa a fisherman; and as hi
gain depend more upon fortun than upon prudenc he trust
habitu to hi good luck after be idl for a whole day he would
cast hi line or hi net and if he wa lucki enough to catch a fine
fish he would go and show it in triumph to hi neighbour the garden

* chi compra ha bisogna di cent occhi; chi vend nha assai di uno

you are oblig to work all day long for your daili bread he would
say look here; i work but five minut and i have not onli daili
bread but daili fish

upon these occas our fisherman alway forgot or neglect to count
the hour and day which were wast in wait for a fair wind to put to
sea or angl in vain on the shore

littl piedro who use to bask in the sun upon the sea-shor besid hi
father and to loung or sleep away hi time in a fishing-boat acquir
habit of idl which seem to hi father of littl consequ
whilst he wa but a child

what will you do with piedro as he grow up neighbour? said the
garden he is smart and quick enough but he is alway in mischief
scarc a day ha pass for thi fortnight but i have caught him
amongst my grape i track hi footstep all over my vineyard

he is but a child yet and know no better repli the fisherman

but if you dont teach him better now he is a child how will he know
when he is a man? said the garden

a mighti nois about a bunch of grape truly! cri the fisherman: a
few grape more or less in your vineyard what doe it signify?

i speak for your son sake and not for the sake of my grape said
the gardener; and i tell you again the boy will not do well in the
world neighbour if you dont look after him in time

hell do well enough in the world you will find answer the
fisherman carelessli whenev he cast my net they never come up
empti it is better to be lucki than wise *

* e meglio esser fortunato che savio

thi wa a proverb which piedro had frequent heard from hi father and
to which he most willingli trust becaus it gave him less troubl to
fanci himself fortun than to make himself wise

come here child said hi father to him when he return home after
the preced convers with the gardener; how old are you my boy?--
twelv year old is not it?

as old as francisco and older by six month said piedro

and smarter and more know by six year said hi father here
take these fish to napl and let us see how youll sell them for me
ventur a small fish as the proverb say to catch a great one * i wa
too late with them at the market yesterday but nobodi will know but what
they are just fresh out of the water unless you go and tell them

* butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio

not i; trust me for that; im not such a fool repli piedro
laughing; i leav that to francisco do you know i saw him the other
day miss sell a melon for hi father by turn the bruis side to
the custom who wa just lay down the money for it and who wa a
raw servant-boy moreover--on who would never have guess there were
two side to a melon if he had not as you say father been told of
it?

off with you to market you are a droll chap said hi father and
will sell my fish cleverli ill be bound as to the rest let everi man
take care of hi own grape you understand me piedro?

perfectli said the boy who perceiv that hi father wa indiffer
as to hi honesti provid he sold fish at the highest price possibl
he proceed to the market and he offer hi fish with assidu to
everi person whom he thought like to buy it especi to those upon
whom he thought he could impos he posit assert to all who
look at hi fish that they were just fresh out of the water good
judg of men and fish knew that he said what wa fals and pass him
by with neglect; but it wa at last what he call good luck to meet with
the veri same young raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruis
melon from francisco he made up to him directli cri fish! fine
fresh fish! fresh fish!

wa it caught to-day? said the boy

ye thi morning; not an hour ago said piedro with the greatest
effronteri

the servant-boy wa impos upon; and be a foreign speak the
italian languag but imperfectli and not be expert at reckon the
italian money he wa no match for the cun piedro who cheat him
not onli as to the fresh but as to the price of the commod
piedro receiv nearli half as much again for hi fish as he ought to
have done

on hi road homeward from napl to the littl villag of resina where
hi father live he overtook francisco who wa lead hi father
ass the ass wa laden with larg pannier which were fill with the
stalk and leav of cauliflow cabbag broccoli lettuc etc--
all the refus of the neapolitan kitchen which are usual collect by
the garden boy and carri to the garden round napl to be mix
with other manur

well fill pannier truli said piedro as he overtook francisco and
the ass the pannier were inde not onli fill to the top but pile
up with much skill and care so that the load met over the anim back

it is not a veri heavi load for the ass though it look so larg said
francisco the poor fellow howev shall have a littl of thi
water ad he lead the ass to a pool by the roadsid

i wa not think of the ass boy; i wa not think of ani ass but
of you when i said well fill pannier truly! thi is your
morn work i presum and youll make anoth journey to napl to-
day on the same errand i warrant befor your father think you have
done enough?

not befor my father think i have done enough but befor i think so
myself repli francisco

i do enough to satisfi myself and my father too said piedro without
slave myself after your fashion look here produc the money he
had receiv for the fish; all thi wa had for ask it is no bad
thing youll allow to know how to ask for money properli

i should be asham to beg or borrow either said francisco

neither did i get what you see by beg or borrow either said
piedro but by use my wits; not as you did yesterday when like a
novic you show the bruis side of your melon and so spoil your
market by your wisdom

wisdom i think it still said francisco

and your father? ask piedro

and my father said francisco

mine is of a differ way of think said piedro he alway tell
me that the buyer ha need of a hundr eye and if one can blind the
whole hundr so much the better you must know i got off the fish to-
day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market--got it off for
fresh just out of the river--got twice as much as the market price for
it; and from whom think you? whi from the veri boobi that would have
bought the bruis melon for a sound one if you would have let him
youll allow im no fool francisco and that im in a fair way to grow
rich if i go on as i have begun

stay said francisco; you forgot that the boobi you took in to-day
will not be so easili taken in to-morrow he will buy no more fish from
you becaus he will be afraid of your cheat him; but he will be readi
enough to buy fruit from me becaus he will know i shall not cheat him--
so youll have lost a custom and i gain one

with all my heart said piedro one custom doe not make a market;
if he buy no more from me what care i? there are peopl enough to buy
fish in napl

and do you mean to serv them all in the same manner? ask francisco

if they will be onli so good as to give me leav said piedro
laugh and repeat hi father proverb ventur a small fish to
catch a larg one * he had learn to think that to cheat in make
bargain wa witti and clever

* see ant

and you have never consid then said francisco that all these
peopl will one after anoth find you out in time?

ay in time; but it will be some time first there are a great mani of
them enough to last me all the summer if i lose a custom a day said
piedro

and next summer observ francisco what will you do?

next summer is not come yet; there is time enough to think what i shall
do befor next summer come whi now suppos the blockhead after
they had been taken in and found it out all join against me and would
buy none of our fish--what then? are there no trade but that of a
fisherman? in napl are there not a hundr way of make money for a
smart lad like me? as my father say what do you think of turn
merchant and sell sugar-plum and cake to the children in their
market? would they be hard to deal with think you?

i think not said francisco; but i think the children would find out
in time if they were cheat and would like it as littl as the men

i dont doubt them then in time i could you know chang my trade--
sell chip and stick in the wood-market--hand about the lemonad to the
fine folk or twenti other thing there are trade enough boy

ye for the honest dealer said francisco but for no other; for in
all of them youll find as my father say that a good charact is the
best fortun to set up with chang your trade ever so often youll be
found out for what you are at last

and what am i pray? said piedro angrili the whole truth of the
matter is francisco that you envi my good luck and cant bear to hear
thi money jingl in my hand ay stroke the long ear of your ass and
look as wise as you pleas it better to be lucki than wise as my
father say good morn to you when i am found out for what i am or
when the worst come to the worst i can drive a stupid ass with hi
pannier fill with rubbish as well as you do now honest francisco

not quit so well unless you were honest francisco you would not fill
hi pannier quit so readili

thi wa certain that francisco wa so well known for hi honesti
amongst all the peopl at napl with whom hi father wa acquaint
that everyon wa glad to deal with him; and as he never wrong anyon
all were will to serv him--at least as much as they could without
loss to themselves: so that after the market wa over hi pannier were
regularli fill by the garden and other with whatev he want
hi industri wa constant hi gain small but certain and he everi day
had more and more reason to trust to hi father maxim--that honesti is
the best polici

the foreign servant lad to whom francisco had so honestli or as piedro
said so sillili shown the bruis side of the melon wa an englishman
he left hi nativ countri of which he wa extrem fond to attend
upon hi master to whom he wa still more attach hi master wa in a
declin state of health and thi young lad wait on him a littl more
to hi mind than hi other servant we must in consider of hi
zeal fidel and inexperi pardon him for not be a good judg of
fish though he had simplic enough to be easili cheat onc he had
too much sens to be twice made a dupe the next time he met piedro in
the market he happen to be in compani with sever english gentlemen
servant and he point piedro out to them all as an arrant knave they
heard hi cri of fresh fish! fresh fish! fine fresh fish! with
incredul smile and let him pass but not without some express of
contempt though utter in english he toler well understood; for
the tone of contempt is suffici express in all languag he
lost more by not sell hi fish to these peopl than he had gain the
day befor by cheat the english boobi the market wa well suppli
and he could not get rid of hi cargo

is not thi truli provoking? said piedro as he pass by francisco
who wa sell fruit for hi father look my basket is as heavi as
when i left home and look at em yourself they realli are fine fresh
fish to-day and yet becaus that reveng boobi told how i took him in
yesterday not one of yonder crowd would buy them; and all the time they
realli are fresh to-day!

so they are said franscisco but you said so yesterday when they
were not; and he that wa dupe then is not readi to believ you to-day
how doe he know that you deserv it better?

he might have look at the fish repeat piedro; they are fresh to-
day i am sure he need not have been afraid

ay said francisco; but as my father said to you once--th scald dog
fear cold water *

* il cane scottato dell acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda

here their convers wa interrupt by the same english lad who
smile as he came up to francisco and take up a fine pine-appl he
said in a mixtur of bad italian and english--i need not look at the
other side of this; you will tell me if it is not as good as it look
name your price; i know you have but one and that an honest one; and as
to the rest i am abl and will to pay for what i buy; that is to say
my master is which come to the same thing i wish your fruit could
make him well and it would be worth it weight in gold to me at least
we must have some of your grape for him

is he not well? inquir francisco we must then pick out the best
for him at the same time singl out a tempt bunch i hope he
will like these; but if you could some day come as far as resina (it is a
villag but a few mile out of town where we have our vineyard) you
could there choos for yourself and pluck them fresh from the vine for
your poor master

bless you my good boy; i should take you for an englishman by your way
of deal ill come to your villag onli write me down the name; for
your italian name slip through my head ill come to the vineyard if it
wa ten mile off; and all the time we stay in napl (may it not be so
long as i fear it will!) with my master leav which he never refus
me to anyth that proper ill deal with you for all our fruit as
sure as my name arthur and with none els with my good will i wish
all your countrymen would take after you in honesti inde i do
conclud the englishman look full at piedro who took up hi unsold
basket of fish look somewhat silli and gloomili walk off

arthur the english servant wa as good as hi word he dealt
constantli with francisco and prove an excel custom buy from
him dure the whole season as much fruit as hi master want hi
master who wa an englishman of distinct wa invit to take up hi
resid dure hi stay in itali at the count de fs villa which
wa in the environ of naples--an easi walk from resina francisco had
the pleasur of see hi father vineyard often full of gener
visitor and arthur who had circul the anecdot of the bruis
melon wa he said proud to think that some of thi wa hi do and
that an englishman never forgot a good turn be it from a countryman or
foreign

my dear boy said francisco father to him whilst arthur wa in the
vineyard help to tend the vine i am to thank you and your honesti
it seem for our have our hand so full of busi thi season it
is fair you should have a share of our profit

so i have father enough and enough when i see you and mother go on
so well what can i want more?

oh my brave boy we know you are a grate good son; but i have been
your age myself; you have companion you have littl expens of your
own here; thi vine thi fig-tre and a melon a week next summer
shall be your with these make a fine figur amongst the littl
neapolitan merchants; and all i wish is that you may prosper as well and
by the same honest mean in manag for yourself as you have done
manag for me

thank you father; and if i prosper at all it shall be by those mean
and no other or i should not be worthi to be call your son

piedro the cun did not make quit so success a summer work as
did francisco the honest no extraordinari event happen no singular
instanc of bad or good luck occurred; but he felt as person usual
do the natur consequ of hi own action he pursu hi scheme
of impos as far as he could upon everi person he dealt with; and the
consequ wa that at last nobodi would deal with him

it is easi to outwit one person but imposs to outwit all the
world said a man * who knew the world at least as well as either piedro
or hi father

* the duke de rochefoucault--on peut etr pul fin quun autr mai
pa plu fin que tou le autr

piedro father amongst other had reason to complain he saw hi own
custom fall off from him and wa told whenev he went into the
market that hi son wa such a cheat there wa no deal with him one
day when he wa return from the market in a veri bad humour in
consequ of these reproach and of hi not have found custom
for hi good he espi hi smart son piedro at a littl merchant
fruit-board devour a fine gourd with prodigi greedi where
glutton do you find money to pay for these dainties? exclaim hi
father come close up to him with angri gestur piedro mouth wa
much too full to make an immedi repli nor did hi father wait for
ani but dart hi hand into the youth pocket pull forth a hand
of silver

the money father said piedro that i got for the fish yesterday and
that i meant to give you to-day befor you went out

then ill make you rememb it against anoth time sirrah! said hi
father ill teach you to fill your stomach with my money am i to
lose my custom by your trick and then find you here eat my all?
you are a rogu and everybodi ha found you out to be a rogue; and the
worst of rogu i find you who scrupl not to cheat hi own father

say these word with great vehem he seiz hold of piedro and in
the veri midst of the littl fruit-market gave him a sever beat
thi beat did the boy no good; it wa vengeanc not punish
piedro saw that hi father wa in a passion and knew that he wa beaten
becaus he wa found out to be a rogu rather than for be one he
recollect perfectli that hi father onc said to him: let everyon
take care of hi own grape

inde it wa scarc reason to expect that a boy who had been
educ to think that he might cheat everi custom he could in the way
of trade should be afterward scrupul honest in hi conduct toward
the father whose proverb encourag hi childhood in cun

piedro writh with bodili pain as he left the market after hi drub
but hi mind wa not in the least amend on the contrari he wa
harden to the sens of shame by the loss of reput all the littl
merchant were spectat of thi scene and heard hi father words:
you are a rogu and the worst of rogu who scrupl not to cheat hi
own father

these word were long rememb and long did piedro feel their effect
he onc flatter himself that when hi trade of sell fish fail
him he could readili engag in some other; but he now found to hi
mortif that what francisco father said prove true: in all
trade the best fortun to set up with is a good charact

not one of the littl neapolitan merchant would either enter into
partnership with him give him credit or even trade with him for readi
money if you would cheat your own father to be sure you will cheat
us wa continu said to him by these prudent littl peopl

piedro wa taunt and treat with contempt at home and abroad hi
father when he found that hi son smart wa no longer use in
make bargain shove him out of hi way whenev he met him all the
food or cloth that he had at home seem to be given to him grudgingli
and with such express as these: take that; but it is too good for
you you must eat thi now instead of gourd and figs--and be thank
you have even thi

piedro spent a whole winter veri unhappili he expect that all hi old
trick and especi what hi father had said of him in the market-
place would be soon forgotten; but month pass after month and still
these thing were fresh in the memori of all who had known them

it is not easi to get rid of a bad charact a veri great rogu * wa
onc heard to say that he would with all hi heart give ten thousand
pound for a good charact becaus he knew that he could make twenti
thousand by it

* chartr

someth like thi wa the sentiment of our cun hero when he
experienc the evil of a bad reput and when he saw the numer
advantag which francisco good charact procur such had been
piedro wretch educ that even the hard lesson of experi
could not alter it pernici effect he wa sorri hi knaveri had
been detect but he still thought it clever to cheat and wa secretli
persuad that if he had cheat success he should have been
happi but i know i am not happi now said he to himself one morn
as he sat alon disconsol by the sea-shor dress in tatter
garment weak and hungri with an empti basket besid him hi fishing-
rod which he held between hi knee bent over the dri sand instead of
into the water for he wa not think of what he wa about; hi arm
were fold hi head hung down and hi rag hat wa slouch over hi
face he wa a melancholi spectacl

francisco as he wa come from hi father vineyard with a larg dish
of purpl and white grape upon hi head and a basket of melon and fig
hang upon hi arm chanc to see piedro seat in thi melancholi
postur touch with compass francisco approach him softly; hi
footstep were not heard upon the sand and piedro did not perceiv that
anyon wa near him till he felt someth cold touch hi hand; he then
start and look up saw a bunch of grape which francisco wa
hold over hi head

eat them: youll find them veri good i hope said francisco with a
benevol smile

they are excellent--most excel and i am much oblig to you
francisco said piedro i wa veri hungri and that what i am now
without anybodi care anyth about it i am not the favourit i wa
with my father but i know it is all my own fault

well but cheer up said francisco; my father alway say one who
know he ha been in fault and acknowledg it will scarc be in
fault again ye take as mani fig as you will continu he; and
held hi basket closer to piedro who as he saw cast a hungri eye upon
one of the ripe fig

but said piedro after he had taken sever shall not i get you into
a scrape by take so many? wont your father be apt to miss them?

do you think i would give them to you if they were not my own? said
francisco with a sudden glanc of indign

well dont be angri that i ask the question; it wa onli from fear of
get you into disgrac that i ask it

it would not be easi for anybodi to do that i hope said francisco
rather proudli

and to me less than anybodi repli piedro in an insinu tone
_i_ that am so much oblig to you!

a bunch of grape and a few fig are no mighti oblig said
francisco smiling; i wish i could do more for you you seem inde
to have been veri unhappi of late we never see you in the market as we
use to do

no; ever sinc my father beat me and call me rogu befor all the
children there i have never been abl to show my face without be
gibe at by one or tother if you would but take me along with you
amongst them and onli just seem my friend for a day or two or so it
would quit set me up again; for they all like you

i would rather be than seem your friend if i could said francisco

ay to be sure; that would be still better said piedro observ that
francisco as he utter hi last sentenc wa separ the grape and
other fruit into two equal divis to be sure i would rather you
would be than seem a friend to me; but i thought that wa too much to ask
at first though i have a notion notwithstand i have been so unlucki
lately--i have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it you
would find me no bad hand if you were to tri and take me into
partnership

partnership! interrupt francisco draw back alarmed; i had no
thought of that

but wont you? cant you? said piedro in a supplic tone; cant
you have thought of it? youd find me a veri activ partner

franscisco still drew back and kept hi eye fix upon the ground he
wa embarrassed; for he piti piedro and he scarc knew how to point
out to him that someth more is necessari in a partner in trade besid
activ and that is honesti

cant you? repeat piedro think that he hesit from mere
mercenari motiv you shall have what share of the profit you
pleas

i wa not think of the profit said francisco; but without
mean to be ill-natur to you piedro i must say that i cannot enter
into ani partnership with you at present; but i will do what perhap
you will like as well said he take half the fruit out of hi basket;
you are heartili welcom to this; tri and sell it in the children
fruit market ill go on befor you and speak to those i am acquaint
with and tell them you are go to set up a new charact and that you
hope to make it a good one

hey shall i! thank you for ever dear francisco cri piedro
seiz hi plenti gift of fruit say what you pleas for me

but dont make me say anyth that is not true said francisco
paus

no to be sure not said piedro; i do mean to give no room for
scandal if i could get them to trust me as they do you i should be
happi inde

that is what you may do if you pleas said francisco adieu i wish
you well with all my heart; but i must leav you now or i shall be too
late for the market



chapter ii

chi va piano va sano e anch lontano
fair and softli goe far in a day

piedro had now an opportun of establish a good charact when he
went into the market with hi grape and fig he found that he wa not
shun or taunt as usual all seem dispos to believ in hi
intend reform and to give him a fair trial

these favour disposit toward him were the consequ of
francisco benevol represent he told them that he thought
piedro had suffer enough to cure him of hi trick and that it would
be cruelti in them becaus he might onc have been in fault to banish
him by their reproach from amongst them and thu to prevent him from
the mean of gain hi livelihood honestli

piedro made a good begin and gave what sever of the younger
custom thought excel bargain hi grape and fig were quickli
sold and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchas
from a fruit dealer a fresh supply; and thu he went on for some time
conduct himself with scrupul honesti so that he acquir some
credit among hi companion they no longer watch him with suspici
eye they trust to hi measur and weight and they count less
care the chang which they receiv from him

the satisfact he felt from thi alter in their manner wa at
first delight to piedro; but in proport to hi credit hi
opportun of defraud increased; and these becam temptat which
he had not the firm to resist hi old manner of think recur

i make but a few shill a day and thi is but slow work said he to
himself what signifi my good charact if i make so littl by it?

light gain and frequent make a heavi purs * wa one of francisco
proverb but piedro wa in too great hast to get rich to take time
into hi account he set hi invent to work and he did not want for
ingenu to devis mean of cheat without run the risk of
detect he observ that the younger part of the commun were
extrem fond of certain colour sugar plum and of burnt almond

* poco e spesso empi il lorsetto

with the money he had earn by two month trade in fruit he laid in a
larg stock of what appear to these littl merchant a stock of almond
and sugar-plum and he paint in capit gold colour letter upon hi
board sweetest largest most admir sugar-plum of all colour ever
sold in napl to be had here; and in gratitud to hi numer
custom piedro add to these burnt almond grati

thi advertis attract the attent of all who could read; and
mani who could not read heard it repeat with delight crowd of
children surround piedro board of promis and they all went away the
first day ampli satisfi each had a full measur of colour sugar-
plum at the usual price and along with these a burnt almond grati
the burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment that it wa
univers allow that the sugar-plum were as the advertis set
forth the largest sweetest most admir ever sold in naples; though
all the time they were in no respect better than ani other sugar-plum

it wa gener report that piedro gave full measure--ful than ani
other board in the citi he measur the sugar-plum in a littl cubic
tin box; and thi it wa affirm he heap up to the top and press
down befor he pour out the content into the open hand of hi
approv custom thi belief and piedro popular continu
longer even than he had expected; and as he thought hi sugar-plum had
secur their reput with the gener public he gradual neglect
to add burnt almond grati

one day a boy of about ten year old pass carelessli by whistl as
he went along and swing a carpent rule in hi hand ha! what
have we here? cri he stop to read what wa written on piedro
board thi promis rare old as i am and tall of my age which
make the matter wors i am still as fond of sugar-plum as my littl
sister who is five year younger than i come signor fill me quick
for im in hast to tast them two measur of the sweetest largest
most admir sugar-plum in naples--on measur for myself and one for
my littl rosetta

youll pay for yourself and your sister then said piedro for no
credit is given here

no credit do i ask repli the live boy; when i told you i love
sugar-plum did i tell you i love them or even my sister so well as
to run in debt for them? here for myself and here for my sister
share said he lay down hi money; and now for the burnt almond
grati my good fellow

they are all out; i have been out of burnt almond thi great while
said piedro

then whi are they in your advertis here? said carlo

i have not had time to scratch them out of the board

what! not when you have by your own account been out of them a great
while? i did not know it requir so much time to blot out a few words--
let us try; and as he spoke carlo for that wa the name of piedro
new custom pull a bit of white chalk out of hi pocket and drew a
broad score across the line on the board which promis burnt almond
grati

you are most impati said piedro; i shall have a fresh stock of
almond to-morrow

whi must the board tell a lie to-day?

it would ruin me to alter it said piedro

a lie may ruin you but i could scarc think the truth could

you have no right to meddl with me or my board said piedro put off
hi guard and out of hi usual soft voic of civil by thi last
observ my charact and that of my board are too firmli
establish now for ani chanc custom like you to injur

i never dream of injur you or anyon els said carlo--i wish
moreov you may not injur yourself do as you pleas with your board
but give me my sugar-plum for i have some right to meddl with those
have paid for them

hold out your hand then

no put them in here if you please; put my sister at least in here;
she like to have them in thi box: i bought some for her in it
yesterday and shell think theyll tast the better out of the same box
but how is this? your measur doe not fill my box nearly; you give us
veri few sugar-plum for our money

i give you full measur as i give to everybodi

the measur should be an inch cube i know said carlo; that what
all the littl merchant have agre to you know

true said piedro so it is

and so it is i must allow said carlo measur the outsid of it
with the carpent rule which he held in hi hand an inch everi way;
and yet by my eye--and i have no bad one be use to measur
carpent work for my father--bi my eye i should think thi would have
held more sugar-plum

the eye often deceiv us; said piedro there noth like
measur you find

there noth like measur i find inde repli carlo as he
look close at the end of hi rule which sinc he spoke last he had
put into the cube to take it depth in the insid thi is not as deep
by a quarter of an inch signor piedro measur within as it is measur
without

piedro chang colour terribl and seiz hold of the tin box
endeavour to wrest it from the youth who measur so accur carlo
held hi prize fast and lift it abov hi head he ran into the midst
of the squar where the littl market wa held exclaim a discovery!
a discovery! that concern all who love sugar-plum a discovery! a
discoveri that concern all who have ever bought the sweetest and most
admir sugar-plum ever sold in napl

the crowd gather from all part of the squar as he spoke

we have bought and we have bought of those sugar-plum cri
sever littl voic at onc if you mean piedro

the same continu carlo--h who out of gratitud to hi numer
custom give or promis to give burnt almond grati

excel they were! cri sever voic we all know piedro well;
but what your discovery?

my discoveri is said carlo that you none of you know piedro look
you here; look at thi box--thi is hi measure; it ha a fals bottom--
it hold onli three-quart as much as it ought to do; and hi numer
custom have all been cheat of one-quart of everi measur of the
admir sugar-plum they have bought from him think twice of a good
bargain say the proverb

so we have been fine dupe inde cri some of the bystand
look at one anoth with a mortifi air full of courtesi full of
craft! * so thi is the mean of hi burnt almond grati cri
others; all join in an uproar of indign except one who as he
stood behind the rest express in hi counten silent surpris and
sorrow

* chi et fa pi caress che non vole
o ingannato tha o inganuar et vole

is thi piedro a relat of yours? said carlo go up to thi silent
person i am sorri if he be that i have publish hi disgrac for i
would not hurt you you dont sell sugar-plum as he doe im sure; for
my littl sister rosetta ha often bought from you can thi piedro be a
friend of yours?

i wish to have been hi friend; but i see i cant said francisco
he is a neighbour of our and i piti him; but sinc he is at hi old
trick again there an end of the matter i have reason to be oblig
to you for i wa nearli taken in he ha behav so well for some time
past that i intend thi veri even to have gone to him and to have
told him that i wa will to do for him what he ha long beg of me
to do--to enter into partnership with him

francisco! francisco!--your measur lend us your measure! exclaim a
number of littl merchant crowd round him you have a measur for
sugar-plums; and we have all agre to refer to that and to see how much
we have been cheat befor we go to break piedro bench and declar him
bankrupt *--the punish for all knave

* thi word come from two italian word bunco rotto--broken bench
banker and merchant use formerli to count their money and write their
bill of exchang upon bench in the streets; and when a merchant or
banker lost hi credit and wa unabl to pay hi debt hi bench wa
broken

they press on to francisco board obtain hi measur found that it
held someth more than a quarter abov the quantiti that could be
contain in piedro the cri of the enrag populac were now most
clamor they hung the just and the unjust measur upon high poles;
and form themselv into a formid phalanx they proceed toward
piedro well known yellow letter board exclaim as they went
along common cause! common cause! the littl neapolitan merchant will
have no knave amongst them! break hi bench! break hi bench! he is a
bankrupt in honesti

piedro saw the mob heard the indign clamour and terrifi at the
approach of number he fled with the utmost precipit have
scarc time to pack up half hi sugar-plum there wa a prodigi
number more than would have fill mani honest measur scatter upon
the ground and trampl under foot by the crowd piedro bench wa
broken and the public vengeanc wreak itself also upon hi treacher
paint board it wa after be much disfigur by variou
inscript express of the univers contempt for piedro hung up in
a conspicu part of the market-place; and the fals measur wa
fasten like a cap upon one of it corner piedro could never more
show hi face in thi market and all hope of friendship--al hope of
partnership with francisco--wer for ever at an end

if rogu would calcul they would ceas to be rogues; for they would
certainli discov that it is most for their interest to be honest--
set asid the pleasur of be esteem and belov of have a
safe conscienc with perfect freedom from all the variou embarrass
and terror to which knave are subject is it not clear that our crafti
hero would have gain rather more by a partnership with francisco and
by a fair charact than he could possibl obtain by fraudul deal
in comfits?

when the mob had dispers after satisfi themselv with execut
summari justic upon piedro bench and board francisco found a
carpent rule lie upon the ground near piedro broken bench which
he recollect to have seen in the hand of carlo he examin it
care and he found carlo name written upon it and the name of the
street where he lived; and though it wa consider out of hi way he
set out immedi to restor the rule which wa a veri handsom one
to it right owner after a hot walk through sever street he
overtook carlo who had just reach the door of hi own hous carlo
wa particularli oblig to him he said for restor thi rule to him
as it wa a present from the master of a vessel who employ hi father
to do carpent work for him one should not prais one self they
say continu carlo but i long so much to gain your good opinion
that i must tell you the whole histori of the rule you have restor it
wa given to me for have measur the work and made up the bill of a
whole pleasure-boat myself you may guess i should have been sorri
enough to have lost it thank you for it be onc more in my careless
hand and tell me i beg whenev i can do you ani servic by-the-bi
i can make up for you a fruit stall ill do it to-morrow and it shall
be the admir of the market is there anyth els you could think
of for me?

whi ye said francisco; sinc you are so good-natur perhap youd
be kind enough to tell me the mean of some of those line and figur
that i see upon your rule i have a great curios to know their use

that ill explain to you with pleasur as far as i know them myself;
but when im at fault my father who is clever than i am and
understand trigonometri can help us out

trigonometry! repeat francisco not a littl alarm at the high
sound word; that what i certainli shall never understand

oh never fear repli carlo laugh i look just as you do now-
-i felt just as you do now--al in a fright and a puzzl when i first
heard of angl and sine and cosin and arc and centr and
complement and tangent

oh mercy! mercy! interrupt francisco whilst carlo laugh with a
benevol sens of superior

whi said carlo youll find all these thing are noth when you are
use to them but i cannot explain my rule to you here broil in the
sun besid it will not be the work of a day i promis you; but come
and see us at your leisur hour and well studi it togeth i have a
great notion we shall becom friends; and to begin step in with me
now said carlo and eat a littl macaroni with us i know it is readi
by thi time besid youll see my father and hell show you plenti
of rule and compass as you like such things; and then ill go home
with you in the cool of the even and you shall show me your melon
and vine and teach me in time someth of garden oh i see we
must be good friend just made for each other; so come in--no ceremoni

carlo wa not mistaken in hi predictions; he and francisco becam veri
good friend spent all their leisur hour togeth either in carlo
workshop or in francisco vineyard and they mutual improv each
other francisco befor he saw hi friend rule knew but just enough
of arithmet to calcul in hi head the price of the fruit which he
sold in the market; but with carlo assist and the ambit to
understand the tabl and figur upon the wonder rule he set to work
in earnest and in due time satisfi both himself and hi master

who know but these thing that i am learn now may be of some use to
me befor i die? said francisco as he wa sit one morn with hi
tutor the carpent

to be sure it will said the carpent put down hi compass
with which he wa draw a circle--arithmet is a most use and i
wa go to say necessari thing to be known by men in all stations; and
a littl trigonometri doe no harm in short my maxim is that no
knowledg come amiss; for a man head is of as much use to him as hi
hands; and even more so

a word to the wise will alway suffic

besid to say noth of make a fortun is not there a great
pleasur in be someth of a scholar and be abl to pass one
time with one book and one compass and pencil? safe companion
these for young and old no one get into mischief that ha pleasant
thing to think of and to do when alone; and i know for my part that
trigonometri is--

here the carpent just as he wa go to pronounc a fresh panegyr
upon hi favourit trigonometri wa interrupt by the sudden entranc
of hi littl daughter rosetta all in tears: a veri unusu spectacl
for take the year round she shed fewer tear than ani child of her
age in napl

whi my dear good humour littl rosetta what ha happened? whi these
larg tears? said her brother carlo and he went up to her and wipe
them from her cheek and these that are go over the bridg of the
nose so fast? i must stop these tear too said carlo

rosetta at thi speech burst out laugh and said that she did not
know till then that she had ani bridg on her nose

and were these shell the caus of the tears? said her brother look
at a heap of shell which she held befor her in her frock

ye partli said rosetta it wa partli my own fault but not all
you know i went out to the carpent yard near the arsen where all
the children are pick up chip and stick so busily; and i wa as busi
as ani of them becaus i want to fill my basket soon; and then i
thought i should sell my basket directli in the littl wood-market
as soon as i had fill my basket and made up my faggot (which wa not
done brother till i wa almost bake by the sun for i wa forc to
wait by the carpent for the bit of wood to make up my faggot)--i say
when it wa all readi and my basket full i left it altogeth in the
yard

that wa not wise to leav it said carlo

hour or so till i had carri my wood to market and till i had sold it
and so had money to pay him for the shell

face he would trust me and that as he wa in a great hurri he could not
wait an hour whilst i sold my wood; but that he wa sure i would pay him
in the even and he told me that he would call here thi even for
the money but now what shall i do carlo? i shall have no money to
give him: i must give back hi shell and that a great piti

but how happen it that you did not sell your wood?

carlo and hi friend went with rosetta immedi to the yard near the
arsen saw the notch piec of wood and then proceed to the littl
wood-market and search everi heap that lay befor the littl factors;
but no notch bit wa to be found and rosetta declar that she did not
see one stick that look at all like ani of her

on their part her companion eagerli unti their faggot to show them
to her and exclaim that they were incap of take what did not
belong to them; that of all person they should never have thought of
take anyth from the good natur littl rosetta who wa alway
readi to give to other and to help them in make up their load

despair of discov the thief francisco and carlo left the market
as they were return home they were met by the english servant arthur
who ask francisco where he had been and where he wa go

as soon as he heard of rosetta lost faggot and of the bit of wood
notch at one end of which rosetta drew the shape with a piec of
chalk which her brother had lent her arthur exclaim i have seen
such a bit of wood as thi within thi quarter of an hour; but i cannot
recollect where stay! thi wa at the baker i think where i went

to the baker they all went as fast as possibl and they got there but
just in time the baker had in hi hand the bit of wood with which he
wa that instant go to feed hi oven

stop good mr baker! cri rosetta who ran into the baker shop
first; and as he heard stop! stop! re-echo by mani voic the baker
stopped; and turn to francisco carlo and arthur beg with a
counten of some surpris to know whi they had desir him to stop

the case wa easili explain and the baker told them that he did not
buy ani wood in the littl market that morning; that thi faggot he had
purchas between the hour of twelv and one from a lad about
francisco height whom he met near the yard of the arsen

thi is my bit of wood i am sure; i know it by thi notch said
rosetta

well said the baker if you will stay here a few minut you will
probabl see the lad who sold it to me he desir to be paid in bread
and my bread wa not quit bake when he wa here i bid him call again
in an hour and i fanci he will be pretti punctual for he look
desper hungri

the baker had scarc finish speak when francisco who wa stand
watch at the door exclaim here come piedro! i hope he is not
the boy who sold you the wood mr baker?

he is the boy though repli the baker and piedro who now enter
the shop start at the sight of carlo and francisco whom he had never
seen sinc the day of disgrac in the fruit-market

your servant signor piedro said carlo; i have the honour to tell you
that thi piec of wood and all that you took out of the basket which
you found in the yard of the arsen belong to my sister

ye inde cri rosetta

piedro be veri certain that nobodi saw him when he empti rosetta
basket and imagin that he wa suspect onli upon the bare assert
of a child like rosetta who might be baffl and frighten out of her
stori boldli deni the charg and defi ani one to prove him guilti

he ha a right to be heard in hi own defenc said arthur with the
cool justic of an englishman; and he stop the angri carlo arm who
wa go up to the culprit with all the italian vehem of oratori and
gestur arthur went on to say someth in bad italian about the
excel of an english trial by juri which carlo wa too much enrag
to hear but to which francisco paid attent and turn to piedro he
ask him if he wa will to be judg by twelv of hi equals?

with all my heart said piedro still maintain an unmov
counten and they return immedi to the littl wood-market on
their way they had pass through the fruit-market and crowd of those
who were well acquaint with piedro former transact follow to
hear the event of the present trial

arthur could not especi as he spoke wretch italian make the eager
littl merchant understand the natur and advantag of an english trial
by juri they prefer their own summari mode of proceed
francisco in whose integr they all had perfect confid wa chosen
with unanim shout for the judge; but he declin the offic and
anoth wa appoint he wa rais upon a bench and the guilti but
insol look piedro and the ingenu modest rosetta stood befor
him she made her complaint in a veri artless manner; and piedro with
ingenu which in a better caus would have deserv admir spoke
volubl and craftili in hi own defenc but all that he could say could
not alter fact the judg compar the notch bit of wood found at the
baker with a piec from which it wa cut which he went to see in the
yard of the arsen it wa found to fit exactli the judg then found
it imposs to restrain the loud indign of all the spectat
the prison wa sentenc never more to sell wood in the market; and the
moment sentenc wa pronounc piedro wa hiss and hoot out of the
market-plac thu a third time he depriv himself of the mean of
earn hi bread

we shall not dwell upon all hi petti method of cheat in the trade
he next attempt he hand lemonad about in a part of napl where he
wa not known but he lost hi custom by put too much water and
too littl lemon into thi beverag he then took to the water from the
sulphur spring and serv them about to foreigners; but one day as
he wa tri to jostl a competitor from the coach door he slip hi
foot and broke hi glass they had been borrow from an old woman
who hire out glass to the boy who sold lemonad piedro knew that it
wa the custom to pay of cours for all that wa broken; but thi he
wa not inclin to do he had a few shill in hi pocket and
thought that it would be veri clever to defraud thi poor woman of her
right and to spend hi shill upon what he valu much more than he
did hi good name--macaroni the shill were soon gone

we shall now for the present leav piedro to hi folli and hi fate;
or to speak more properli to hi folli and their inevit
consequ

francisco wa all thi time acquir knowledg from hi new friend
without neglect hi own or hi father busi he contriv
dure the cours of autumn and winter to make himself a toler
arithmetician carlo father could draw plan in architectur neatly;
and pleas with the eager francisco show to receiv instruct
he willingli put a pencil and compass into hi hand and taught him all
he knew himself francisco had great persever and by repeat
trial he at length succeed in copi exactli all the plan which hi
master lent him hi copi in time surpass the origin and carlo
exclaim with astonishment: whi francisco what an astonish
geniu you have for drawing!--absolut you draw plan better than my
father!

as to geniu said francisco honestli i have none all that i have
done ha been done by hard labour i dont know how other peopl do
things; but i am sure that i never have been abl to get anyth done
well but by patienc dont you rememb carlo how you and even
rosetta laugh at me the first time your father put a pencil into my
awkward clumsi hands?

becaus said carlo laugh again at the recollect you held your
pencil so drolly; and when you were to cut it you cut it just as if you
were use a pruning-knif to your vines; but now it is your turn to
laugh for you surpass us all and the time are chang sinc i set
about to explain thi rule of mine to you

ay that rule said francisco--how much i owe to it! some great
peopl when they lose ani of their fine thing caus the crier to
promis a reward of so much money to anyon who shall find and restor
their trinket how richli have you and your father reward me for
return thi rule!

francisco modesti and gratitud as they were perfectli sincer
attach hi friend to him most powerfully; but there wa one person who
regret our hero frequent absenc from hi vineyard at resina not
francisco father for he wa well satisfi hi son never neglect hi
business; and as to the hour spent in napl he had so much confid
in francisco that he felt no apprehens of hi get into bad
compani when hi son had onc said to him i spend my time at such a
place and in such and such a manner he wa as well convinc of it
be so as if he had watch and seen him everi moment of the day but
it wa arthur who complain of francisco absenc

i see becaus i am an englishman said he you dont valu my
friendship and yet that is the veri reason you ought to valu it; no
friend so good as the english be it spoken without offenc to your
italian friend for whom you now continu leav me to dodg up and
down here in resina without a soul that i like to speak to for you are
the onli italian i ever like

you shall like anoth i promis you said francisco you must come
with me to carlo and see how i spend my evenings; then complain of me
if you can

it wa the utmost stretch of arthur complais to pay thi visit;
but in spite of hi nation prejudic and habitu reserv of temper
he wa pleas with the recept he met with from the gener carlo and
the play rosetta they show him francisco draw with
enthusiast eagerness; and arthur though no great judg of draw wa
in astonish and frequent repeat i know a gentleman who visit
my master who would like these thing i wish i might have them to show
him

take them then said carlo; i wish all napl could see them
provid they might be like half as well as i like them

arthur carri off the draw and one day when hi master wa better
than usual and when he wa at leisur eat a dessert of francisco
grape he enter respect with hi littl portfolio under hi arm
and beg permiss to show hi master a few draw done by the
garden son whose grape he wa eat

though not quit so partial a judg as the enthusiast carlo thi
gentleman wa both pleas and surpris at the sight of these draw
consid how short a time francisco had appli himself to thi art
and what slight instruct he had receiv arthur wa desir to
summon the young artist francisco honest open manner join to the
proof he had given of hi abil and the charact arthur gave him
for strict honesti and constant kind to hi parent interest mr
lee the name of thi english gentleman much in hi favour mr lee wa
at thi time in treati with an italian painter whom he wish to engag
to copi for him exactli some of the cornic mould tablet and
antiqu ornament which are to be seen amongst the ruin of the ancient
citi of herculaneum *

* we must give those of our young english reader who may not be
acquaint with the ancient citi of herculaneum some idea of it none
can be ignor that near napl is the celebr volcan mountain of
vesuvius;--that from time to time there happen violent erupt from
thi mountain; that is to say flame and immens cloud of smoke issu
from differ open mouth or crater as they are call but more
especi from the summit of the mountain which is distinguish by the
name of the crater a rumbl and afterward a roar nois is heard
within and prodigi quantiti of stone and miner burnt into

chapter iii

tutt le gran faciend si fanno di poca cosa
what great event from trivial caus spring

signor camillo the artist employ by mr lee to copi some of the
antiqu ornament in herculaneum wa a liber mind man perfectli
free from that mean jealousi which would repress the effort of rise
geniu

here is a lad scarc fifteen a poor garden son who with mere
the instruct he could obtain from a common carpent ha learn to
draw these plan and elev which you see are toler neat what
an advantag your instruct would be to him said mr lee as he
introduc francisco to signor camillo i am interest in thi lad
from what i have learn of hi good conduct i hear he is strictli
honest and one of the best of son let us do someth for him if
you will give him some knowledg of your art i will as far as money can
recompens you for your loss of time pay whatev you may think
reason for hi instruct

signor camillo made no difficulties; he wa pleas with hi pupil
appear and everi day he like him better and better in the room
where they work togeth there were some larg book of draw and
plate which francisco saw now and then open by hi master and which
he had a great desir to look over; but when he wa left in the room by
himself he never touch them becaus he had not permiss signor
camillo the first day he came into thi room with hi pupil said to
him here are mani valuabl book and draw young man i trust
from the charact i have heard of you that they will be perfectli safe
here

some week after francisco had been with the painter they had occas
to look for the front of a templ in one of these larg book what!
dont you know in which book to look for it francisco? cri hi
master with some impati is it possibl that you have been here so
long with these book and that you cannot find the print i mean? had
you half the tast i gave you credit for you would have singl it out
from all the rest and have it fix in your memori

but signor i never saw it said francisco respect or
perhap i should have prefer it

that you never saw it young man is the veri thing of which i complain
is a tast for the art to be learn think you by look at the cover
of a book like this? is it possibl that you never thought of open
it?

often and often cri francisco have i long to open it; but i
thought it wa forbidden me and howev great my curios in your
absenc i have never touch them i hope inde that the time would
come when you would have the good to show them to me

and so the time is come excel young man cri camillo; much as i
love tast i love integr more i am now sure of your have the one
and let me see whether you have as i believ you have the other sit
you down here besid me; and we will look over these book togeth

the attent with which hi young pupil examin everyth and the
pleasur he unaffectedli express in see these excel print
suffici convinc hi judici master that it wa not from the want
of curios or tast that he had never open these tempt volum
hi confid in francisco wa much increas by thi circumst
slight as it may appear

one day signor camillo came behind francisco as he wa draw with
much intent and tap him upon the shoulder he said to him: put
up your pencil and follow me i can depend upon your integrity; i have
pledg myself for it bring your note-book with you and follow me; i
will thi day show you someth that will entertain you at least as much
as my larg book of print follow me

francisco follow till they came to the pit near the entranc of
herculaneum i have obtain leav for you to accompani me said hi
master and you know i suppos that thi is not a permiss grant
to everyone? paint of great valu besid ornament of gold and
silver antiqu bracelet ring etc are from time to time found
amongst these ruin and therefor it is necessari that no person should
be admit whose honesti cannot be depend upon thu even
francisco talent could not have advanc him in the world unless they
had been unit to integr he wa much delight and astonish by
the new scene that wa now open to hi view; and as day after day he
accompani hi master to thi subterran citi he had leisur for
observ he wa employ as soon as he had gratifi hi curios
in draw there are nich in the wall in sever place from which
pictur have been dug and these nich are often adorn with eleg
masqu figur and anim which have been left by the ignor or
careless workmen and which are go fast to destruct signor
camillo who wa copi these for hi english employ had a mind to
tri hi pupil skill and point to a nich border with grotesqu
figur he desir him to tri if he could make ani hand of it
francisco made sever trial and at last finish such an excel
copi that hi enthusiast and gener master with warm encomium
carri it immedi to hi patron and he had the pleasur to receiv
from mr lee a purs contain five guinea as a reward and
encourag for hi pupil

francisco had no sooner receiv thi money than he hurri to hi
father and mother cottag hi mother some month befor thi time
had taken a small dairi farm; and her son had onc heard her express a
wish that she wa but rich enough to purchas a remark fine brindl
cow which belong to a farmer in the neighbourhood

here my dear mother cri francisco pour the guinea into her
lap; and here continu he empti a bag which contain about as
much more in small italian coin the profit of trade-money he had
fairli earn dure the two year he sold fruit amongst the littl
neapolitan merchants; thi is all your dearest mother and i hope it
will be enough to pay for the brindl cow nay you must not refus me-
-i have set my heart upon the cow be milk by you thi veri evening;
and ill produc my best bunch of grape and my father perhap will
give us a melon; for ive had no time for melon thi season; and ill
step to napl and invite--may i mother?--mi good friend dear carlo
and your favourit littl rosetta and my old draw master and my
friend arthur and well sup with you at your dairi

the happi mother thank her son and the father assur him that neither
melon nor pine-appl should be spare to make a supper worthi of hi
friend

the brindl cow wa bought and arthur and carlo and rosetta most
joy accept their invit

the carpent had unluckili appoint to settl a long account that day
with one of hi employ and he could not accompani hi children it
wa a delici evening; they left napl just as the sea-breez after
the heat of the day wa most refreshingli felt the walk to resina
the vineyard the dairi and most of all the brindl cow were prais
by carlo and rosetta with all the italian superl which signifi
most beautiful! most delightful! most charming! whilst the english
arthur with as warm a heart wa more temper in hi prais declar
that thi wa the most like an english summer even of ani he had
ever felt sinc he came to italy: and that moreov the cream wa
almost as good as what he had been use to drink in cheshir the
compani who were all pleas with each other and with the garden
good fruit which he produc in great abund did not think of
separ till late

it wa a bright moonlight night and carlo ask hi friend if he would
walk with them part of the way to napl ye all the way most
willingli cri francisco that i may have the pleasur of give to
your father with my own hand thi fine bunch of grape that i have
reserv for him out of my own share

add thi fine pine-appl for my share then said hi father and a
pleasant walk to you my young friend

they proceed gaili along and when they reach napl as they pass
through the squar where the littl merchant held their market
francisco point to the spot where he found carlo rule he never
miss an opportun of show hi friend that he did not forget their
former kind to him that rule said he ha been the caus of all
my present happi and i thank you for--

oh never mind thank him now interrupt rosetta but look yonder
and tell me what all those peopl are about she point to a group of
men women and children who were assembl under a piazza listen in
variou attitud of attent to a man who wa stand upon a flight
of step speak in a loud voic and with much action to the peopl
who surround him francisco carlo and rosetta join hi audienc
the moon shone full upon hi counten which wa veri express and
which vari frequent accord to the charact of the person whose
histori he wa tell accord to all the chang of their fortun
thi man wa one of those who are call improvisatori--person who in
italian town go about recit vers or tell stori which they
are suppos to invent as they go on speak some of these peopl speak
with great fluenci and collect crowd round them in the public street
when an improvisator see the attent of hi audienc fix and when
he come to some veri interest part of hi narr he dexter
drop hi hat upon the ground and paus till hi auditor have paid
tribut to hi eloqu when he think the hat suffici full he
take it up again and proce with hi stori the hat wa drop just
as francisco and hi two friend came under the piazza the orat had
finish one stori and wa go to commenc anoth he fix hi eye
upon francisco then glanc at carlo and rosetta and after a moment
consider he began a stori which bore some resembl to one that
our young english reader may perhap know by the name of cornaro or
the grate turk

francisco wa deepli interest in thi narr and when the hat wa
drop he eagerli threw in hi contribut at the end of the stori
when the speaker voic stop there wa a momentari silenc which
wa broken by the orat himself who exclaim as he took up the hat
which lay at hi feet my friend here is some mistake! thi is not my
hat; it ha been chang whilst i wa taken up with my stori pray
gentlemen find my hat amongst you; it wa a remark good one a
present from a nobleman for an epigram i made i would not lose my hat
for twice it valu it ha my name written withinsid of it dominicho
improvisator pray gentlemen examin your hat

everybodi present examin their hat and show them to dominicho but
hi wa not amongst them no one had left the company; the piazza wa
clear and search in vain the hat ha vanish by magic said
dominicho

ye and by the same magic a statu move cri carlo point to a
figur stand in a nich which had hitherto escap observ the
face wa so much in the shade that carlo did not at first perceiv that
the statu wa piedro piedro when he saw himself discov burst
into a loud laugh and throw down dominicho hat which he held in
hi hand behind him cri a pretti set of novices! most excel
player at hide-and-seek you would make

whether piedro realli meant to have carri off the poor man hat or
whether he wa as he said mere in jest we leav it to those who know
hi gener charact to decid

carlo shook hi head still at your old trick piedro said he
rememb the old proverb: no fox so cun but he come to the
furrier at last *

* tutt le volpi si trovano in pellicera

i defi the furrier and you too repli piedro take up hi own
rag hat i have no need to steal hats; i can afford to buy better
than youll have upon your head francisco a word with you if you have
done cri at the piti stori you have been listen to so
attent

and what would you say to me? said francisco follow him a few
step do not detain me long becaus my friend will wait for me

if they are friend they can wait said piedro you need not be
asham of be seen in my compani now i can tell you; for i am as i
alway told you i should be the richest man of the two

rich! you rich? cri francisco well then it wa imposs you
could mean to trick that poor man out of hi good hat

impossible! said piedro francisco did not consid that those who
have habit of pilfer continu to practis them often when the
poverti which first tempt them to dishonesti ceas impossible! you
stare when i tell you i am rich; but the thing is so moreov i am
well with my father at home i have friend in napl and i call myself
piedro the lucki look you here said he produc an old gold coin
thi doe not smell of fish doe it? my father is no longer a
fisherman nor i either neither do i sell sugar-plum to children: nor
do i slave myself in a vineyard like some folks; but fortun when i
least expect it ha stood my friend i have mani piec of gold like
thi dig in my father garden it wa my luck to come to an old
roman vessel full of gold i have thi day agre for a hous in napl
for my father we shall live whilst we can afford it like great folk
you will see; and i shall enjoy the envi that will be felt by some of my
old friend the littl neapolitan merchant who will chang their note
when they see my chang of fortun what say you to all thi francisco
the honest?

that i wish you joy of your prosper and hope you may enjoy it long
and well

well no doubt of that everyon who ha it enjoy it well he alway
danc well to whom fortun pipe *

* assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona

ye no longer pipe no longer danc repli francisco; and here they
parted; for piedro walk away abruptli much mortifi to perceiv that
hi prosper did not excit much envi or command ani addit
respect from francisco

i would rather said francisco when he return to carlo and rosetta
who wait for him under the portico where he left them--i would rather
have such good friend as you carlo and arthur and some more i could
name and besid that have a clear conscienc and work honestli for
my bread than be as lucki as piedro do you know he ha found a
treasur he say in hi father garden--a vase full of gold? he
show me one of the gold piec

much good may they do him i hope he came honestli by them said
carlo; but ever sinc the affair of the doubl measur i suspect
double-d alway from him it is not our affair howev let him
make himself happi hi way and we our

he that would live in peac and rest
must hear and see and say the best *

* odi vedi taci se vuoi viver in pace

all piedro neighbour did not follow thi peaceabl maxim; for when he
and hi father began to circul the stori of the treasur found in the
garden the villag of resina did not give them implicit faith peopl
nod and whisper and shrug their shoulders; then cross
themselv and declar that they would not for all the rich of
napl chang place with either piedro or hi father regardless or
pretend to be regardless of these suspicion piedro and hi father
persist in their assert the fishing-net were sold and
everyth in their cottag wa dispos of; they left resina went to
live at napl and after a few week the matter began to be almost
forgotten in the villag

the old garden francisco father wa one of those who endeavour to
think the best; and all that he said upon the subject wa that he would
not exchang francisco the honest for piedro the lucky; that one cant
judg of the day till one see the even as well as the morn *

* la vita il fine-- di loda la sera
comput the morn and even of their day--pop

not to leav our reader longer in suspens we must inform them that the
peasant of resina were right in their suspicion piedro had never
found ani treasur in hi father garden but he came by hi gold in the
follow manner:--

after he wa banish from the littl wood-market for steal rosetta
basket of wood after he had cheat the poor woman who let glass
out to hire out of the valu of the glass which he broke and in
short after he had entir lost hi credit with all who knew him he
roam about the street of napl reckless of what becam of him

he found the truth of the proverb that credit lost is like a venic
glass broken--it cant be mend again the few shill which he had
in hi pocket suppli him with food for a few day at last he wa glad
to be employ by one of the peasant who came to napl to load their
ass with manur out of the street they often follow veri earli in
the morn or dure the night-tim the trace of carriag that are
gone or that are return from the opera; and piedro wa one night at
thi work when the hors of a nobleman carriag took fright at the
sudden blaze of some firework the carriag wa overturn near him; a
ladi wa taken out of it and wa hurri by her attend into a shop
where she stay till her carriag wa set to right she wa too much
alarm for the first ten minut after her accid to think of
anything; but after some time she perceiv that she had lost a valuabl
diamond cross which she had worn that night at the opera she wa
uncertain where she had drop it; the shop the carriag the street
were search for it in vain

piedro saw it fall as the ladi wa lift out of the carriag seiz
upon it and carri it off ignor as he wa of the full valu of
what he had stolen he knew not how to satisfi himself as to thi point
without trust someon with the secret

after some hesit he determin to appli to a jew who as it wa
whisper wa readi to buy everyth that wa offer to him for sale
without make ani troublesom inquiri it wa late; he wait till
the street were clear and then knock softli at the back door of the
jew hous the person who open the door for piedro wa hi own
father piedro start back; but hi father had fast hold of him

what bring you here? said the father in a low voic a voic which
express fear and rage mix

onli to ask my way--mi shortest way stammer piedro

no equivocations! tell me what bring you here at thi time of the
night? i will know

piedro who felt himself in hi father grasp and who knew that hi
father would certainli search him to find out what he had brought to
sell thought it most prudent to produc the diamond cross hi father
could but just see it lustr by the light of a dim lamp which hung over
their head in the gloomi passag in which they stood

you would have been dupe if you had gone to sell thi to the jew it
is well it ha fallen into my hand how came you by it? piedro
answer that he had found it in the street go your way home then
said hi father; it is safe with me concern yourself no more about
it

piedro wa not inclin thu to relinquish hi booti and he now thought
proper to vari in hi account of the manner in which he found the cross
he now confess that it had drop from the dress of a ladi whose
carriag wa overturn as she wa come home from the opera and he
conclud by say that if hi father took hi prize from him without
give him hi share of the profit he would go directli to the shop
where the ladi stop whilst her servant were rais the carriag and
that he would give notic of hi have found the cross

piedro father saw that hi smart son though scarc sixteen year of
age wa a match for him in villaini he promis him that he should
have half of whatev the jew would give for the diamond and piedro
insist upon be present at the transact

we do not wish to lay open to our young reader scene of iniqu it
is suffici to say that the jew who wa a man old in all the art of
villaini contriv to cheat both hi associ and obtain the
diamond cross for less than half it valu the matter wa manag so
that the transact remain undiscov the ladi who lost the cross
after make fruitless inquiri gave up the search and piedro and hi
father rejoic in the success of their manoeuvr

it is said that ill gotten wealth is quickli spent; * and so it prove
in thi instanc both father and son live a riotou life as long as
their money last and it did not last mani month what hi bad
educ began bad compani finish and piedro mind wa complet
ruin by the associ with whom he becam connect dure what he
call hi prosper when hi money wa at an end these unprincipl
friend began to look cold upon him and at last plainli told him--if
you mean to live with us you must live as we do they live by
robberi

* vien presto consumato lingiustament acquistato

piedro though familiar to the idea of fraud wa shock at the
thought of becom a robber by profess how difficult it is to stop
in the career of vice! whether piedro had power to stop or whether he
wa hurri on by hi associ we shall for the present leav in
doubt



chapter iv

we turn with pleasur from piedro the cun to francisco the honest
francisco continu the happi and use cours of hi life by hi
unremit persever he improv himself rapidli under the
instruct of hi master and friend signor camillo; hi friend we
say for the fair and open charact of francisco won or rather earn
the friendship of thi benevol artist the english gentleman seem
to take a pride in our hero success and good conduct he wa not one
of those patron who think that they have done enough when they have
given five guinea hi servant arthur alway consid everi gener
action of hi master as hi own and wa particularli pleas whenev
thi generos wa direct toward francisco

as for carlo and the littl rosetta they were the companion of all the
pleasant walk which francisco use to take in the cool of the even
after he had been shut up all day at hi work and the old carpent
delight with the gratitud of hi pupil frequent repeated--that he
wa proud to have given the first instruct to such a genius; and that
he had alway prophesi francisco would be a great man

and a good man papa said rosetta; for though he ha grown so great
and though he goe into palac now to say noth of that place
underground where he ha leav to go yet notwithstand all thi he
never forget my brother carlo and you

that the way to have good friend said the carpent and i like
hi way; he doe more than he say fact are masculin and word are
feminin *

* i fatti sono maschii le parol femmin

these good friend seem to make francisco happier than piedro could be
made by hi stolen diamond

one morn francisco wa sent to finish a sketch of the front of an
ancient templ amongst the ruin of herculaneum he had just reach
the pit and the men were about to let him down with cord in the usual
manner when hi attent wa caught by the shrill sound of a scold
woman voic he look and saw at some pace distant thi femal
furi who stood guard the windlass of a well to which with
threaten gestur and most volubl menac she forbad all access
the peasants--men women and children who had come with their pitcher
to draw water at thi well--wer held at bay by the enrag femal not
one dare to be the first to advance; whilst she grasp with one hand
the handl of the windlass and with the other tan muscular arm
extend govern the populac bid them rememb that she wa
padrona or mistress of the well they retir in hope of find a
more gentl padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood; and the
furi when they were out of sight divid the long black hair which hung
over her face and turn to one of the spectat appeal to them in
a sober voic and ask if she wa not right in what she had done? i
that am padrona of the well said she address herself to francisco
who with great attent wa contempl her with the eye of a
painter--i that am padrona of the well must in time of scarciti do
strict justic and preserv for ourselv alon the water of our well
there is scarc enough even for ourselv i have been oblig to make
my husband lengthen the rope everi day for thi week past if thing go
on at thi rate there will soon be not one drop of water left in my
well

nor in ani of the well of the neighbourhood ad one of the workmen
who wa stand by; and he mention sever in which the water had
late suddenli decreased; and a miller affirm that hi mill had
stop for want of water

francisco wa struck by these remark they brought to hi recollect
similar fact which he had often heard hi father mention in hi
childhood as have been observ previou to the last erupt of mount
vesuviu * he had also heard from hi father in hi childhood that it
is better to trust to prudenc than to fortune; and therefor though the
peasant and workmen to whom he mention hi fear laugh and said
that as the burn mountain had been favour to them for so mani
year they would trust to it and st januariu one day longer yet
francisco immedi gave up all thought of spend thi day amidst
the ruin of herculaneum after have inquir suffici after
have seen sever well in which the water had evid decreas
and after have seen the mill-wheel that were stand still for want
of their usual suppli he hasten home to hi father and mother
report what he had heard and seen and beg of them to remov and to
take what thing of valu they could to some distanc from the danger
spot where they now resid

* phil tran vol ix

some of the inhabit of resina whom he question declar that they
had heard strang rumbl nois underground; and a peasant and hi son
who had been at work the preced day in a vineyard a littl abov the
villag relat that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of
the earth close to them; and that they had at the same time heard a
nois like the go off of a pistol *

* these fact are mention in sir william hamilton account of an
erupt of mount vesuvius--se phil tran 1795 first part

the villag listen with larg eye and open ear to these relations;
yet such wa their habitu attach to the spot they live upon or
such the secur in their own good fortun that few of them would
believ that there could be ani necess for removing--wel see what
will happen to-morrow; we shall be safe here one day longer said they

francisco father and mother more prudent than the gener of their
neighbour went to the hous of a relat at some mile distanc from
vesuviu and carri with them all their effect

in the meantim francisco went to the villa where hi english friend
resid the villa wa in a most danger situat near terr del
greco--a town that stand at the foot of mount vesuviu he relat all
the fact that he had heard to arthur who not have been like the
inhabit of resina familiar to the idea of live in the vicin
of a burn mountain and habitu to trust in st januariu wa
suffici alarm by francisco represent he ran to hi
master apart and commun all that he had just heard the
count de flora and hi ladi who were at thi time in the hous
ridicul the fear of arthur and could not be prevail upon to remov
even as far as napl the ladi wa intent upon prepar for her
birthday which wa to be celebr in a few day with great
magnific at their villa; and she observ that it would be a piti to
return to town befor that day and they had everyth arrang for the
festiv the prudent englishman had not the gallantri to appear to be
convinc by these argument and he left the place of danger he left
it not too soon for the next morn exhibit a scene--a scene which we
shall not attempt to describ

we refer our young reader to the account of thi dread erupt of
mount vesuviu publish by sir w hamilton in the philosoph
transact it is suffici here to say that in the space of about
five hour the wretch inhabit of torr del greco saw their town
utterli destroy by the stream of burn lava which pour from the
mountain the villa of count de flora with some other which were at a
littl distanc from the town escaped; but they were absolut
surround by the lava the count and countess were oblig to fli from
their hous with the utmost precipit in the night-time; and they had
not time to remov ani of their furnitur their plate cloth or
jewel

a few day after the erupt the surfac of the lava becam so cool
that peopl could walk upon it though sever feet beneath the surfac
it wa still exceedingli hot number of those who had been forc from
their hous now return to the ruin to tri to save whatev they
could but these unfortun person frequent found their hous had
been pillag by robber who in these moment of gener confus
enrich themselv with the spoil of their fellow-creatur

ha the count abandon hi villa? and is there no one to take care of
hi plate and furniture? the hous will certainli be ransack befor
morn said the old carpent to francisco who wa at hi hous
give him an account of their flight francisco immedi went to the
count hous in warn him of hi danger the first person he saw wa
arthur who with a face of terror said to him do you know what ha
happened? it is all over with resina!

all over with resina! what ha there been a fresh eruption? ha the
lava reach resina?

no; but it will inevit be blown up there said arthur point
to a thin figur of an italian who stood pale and trembl and look
up to heaven as he cross himself repeatedli there said arthur is
a man who ha left a parcel of hi curs rocket and firework with i
dont know how much gunpowd in the count hous from which we have
just fled the wind blow that way one spark of fire and the whole is
blown up

francisco wait not to hear more; but instantli without explain hi
intent to anyon set out for the count villa and with a bucket
of water in hi hand cross the bed of lava with which the hous wa
encompassed; when reach the hall where the rocket and gunpowd were
left he plung them into the water and return with them in safeti
over the lava yet warm under hi feet

what wa the surpris and joy of the poor firework-mak when he saw
francisco return from thi danger expedition! he could scarc
believ hi eye when he saw the rocket and the gunpowd all safe

the count who had given up the hope of save hi palac wa in
admir when he heard of thi instanc of intrepid which properli
save not onli hi villa but the whole villag of resina from
destruct these firework had been prepar for the celebr of
the countess birthday and were forgotten in the hurri of the night on
which the inhabit fled from torr del greco

brave young man! said the count to francisco i thank you and shall
not limit my gratitud to thank you tell me that there is danger of my
villa be pillag by robber it is from thi moment your interest
as well as mine to prevent their depredations; for (trust to my
liberality) a portion of all that is save of mine shall be your

bravo! bravissimo! exclaim one who start from a recess window in
the hall where all thi pass bravo! bravissimo!--francisco thought
he knew the voic and the counten of thi man who exclaim with so
much enthusiasm he rememb to have seen him befor but when or
where he could not recollect as soon as the count left the hall the
stranger came up to francisco is it possibl said he that you
dont know me? it is scarc a twelvemonth sinc i drew tear from your
eye

tear from my eyes? repeat francisco smiling; i have shed but few
tear i have had but few misfortun in my life the stranger
answer him by two extempor italian line which convey nearli the
same idea that ha been so well express by an english poet:--

to each their sufferings--al are men
condemnd alik to groan;
the feel for anoth woe
th unfeel for hi own

i know you now perfectli well cri francisco; you are the
improvisator who one fine moonlight night last summer told us the
stori of cornaro the turk

the same said the improvisatore; the same though in a better dress
which i should not have thought would have made so much differ in
your eye though it make all the differ between man and man in the
eye of the stupid vulgar my geniu ha broken through the cloud of
misfortun of late a few happi impromptu vers i made on the count de
flora fall from hi hors attract attent the count patron
me i am here now to learn the fate of an ode i have just compos for
hi ladi birthday my ode wa to have been set to music and to have
been perform at hi villa near torr del greco if these troubl had
not interven now that the mountain is quiet again peopl will return
to their sens i expect to be munific reward but perhap i
detain you go; i shall not forget to celebr the heroic action you
have perform thi day i still amus myself amongst the populac in my
tatter garb late in the even and i shall sound your prais
through napl in a poem i mean to recit on the late erupt of mount
vesuviu adieu

the improvisator wa as good as hi word that even with more than
hi usual enthusiasm he recit hi vers to a great crowd of peopl in
one of the public squar amongst the crowd were sever to whom the
name of francisco wa well known and by whom he wa well belov these
were hi young companion who rememb him as a fruit-sel amongst
the littl merchant they rejoic to hear hi prais and repeat
the line with shout of applaus

let us pass what is all thi disturb in the streets? said a man
push hi way through the crowd a lad who held by hi arm stop
suddenli on hear the name of francisco which the peopl were
repeat with so much enthusiasm

ha! i have found at last a stori that interest you more than that of
cornaro the turk cri the improvisator look in the face of the
youth who had stop so suddenli you are the young man who last
summer had like to have trick me out of my new hat promis me you
wont touch it now said he throw down the hat at hi feet or you
hear not one word i have to say not one word of the heroic action
perform at the villa of the count de flora near torr del greco thi
morn by signor francisco

signor francisco! repeat the lad with disdain well let us hear
what you have to tell of him ad he your hat is veri safe i
promis you; i shall not touch it what of signor francisco?

signor francisco i may without improprieti call him said the
improvisator for he is like to becom rich enough to command the
titl from those who might not otherwis respect hi merit

like to becom rich! how? said the lad whom our reader have
probabl befor thi time discov to be piedro how pray is he
like to becom rich enough to be a signor?

the count de flora ha promis him a liber portion of all the fine
furnitur plate and jewel that can be save from hi villa at torr del
greco francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count
domest to protect the valuabl good against those villain
plunder who rob their fellow-creatur of what even the flame of
vesuviu would spare

come we have had enough of thi stuff cri the man whose arm piedro
held come away and he hurri forward

thi man wa one of the villain against whom the honest orat express
such indign he wa one of those with whom piedro got acquaint
dure the time that he wa live extravagantli upon the money he gain
by the sale of the stolen diamond cross that robberi wa not
discovered; and hi success as he call it harden him in guilt he
wa both unwil and unabl to withdraw himself from the bad compani
with whom hi ill gotten wealth connect him he did not consid that
bad compani lead to the gallow *

* la mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca

the univers confus which follow the erupt of mount vesuviu wa
to these villain a time of rejoic no sooner did piedro companion
hear of the rich furnitur plate etc which the imprud orat had
describ as belong to the count de flora villa than he long to
make himself master of the whole

it is a piti said piedro that the count ha sent francisco with hi
servant down to guard it

and who is thi francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe?

a boy a young lad onli of about my own age; but i know him to be
sturdili honest the servant we might corrupt; but even the old proverb
of angl with a silver hook * wont hold good with him

* pescar col hamo dargento

and if he cannot be won by fair mean he must be conquer by foul
said the desper villain; but if we offer him rather more than the
count ha alreadi promis for hi share of the booti of cours he will
consult at onc hi safeti and hi interest

no said piedro; that is not hi natur i know him from a child and
we had better think of some other hous for to-night busi

none other; none but thi cri hi companion with an oath my mind
is determin upon thi and you must obey your leader: recollect the
fate of him who fail me yesterday

the person to whom he allud wa one of the gang of robber who had been
assassin by hi companion for hesit to commit some crime
suggest by their leader no tyranni is so dread as that which is
exercis by villain over their young accomplic who becom their
slave piedro who wa of a cowardli natur trembl at the
threaten counten of hi captain and promis submiss

in the cours of the morn inquiri were made secretli amongst the
count servants; and the two men who were engag to sit up at the villa
that night along with francisco were bribe to second the view of thi
gang of thiev it wa agre that about midnight the robber should be
let into the house; that francisco should be tie hand and foot whilst
they carri off their booti he is a stubborn chap though so young i
understand said the captain of the robber to hi men; but we carri
poniard and know how to use them piedro you look pale you dont
requir to be remind of what i said to you when we were alon just
now?

piedro voic fail and some of hi comrad observ that he wa
young and new to the busi the captain who from be hi
pretend friend dure hi wealthi day had of late becom hi tyrant
cast a stern look at piedro and bid him be sure to be at the old jew
which wa the place of meet in the dusk of the even after say
thi he depart

piedro when he wa alon tri to collect hi thoughts--al hi
thought were full of horror where am i? said he to himself; what am
i about? did i understand rightli what he said about poniards?
francisco; oh francisco! excel kind gener francisco! ye i
recollect your look when you held the bunch of grape to my lip as i
sat by the sea-shor desert by all the world; and now what friend
have i robber and-- the word murder he could not utter he again
recollect what had been said about poniard and the longer hi mind
fix upon the word and the look that accompani them the more he wa
shock he could not doubt but that it wa the seriou intent of hi
accomplic to murder francisco if he should make ani resist

piedro had at thi moment no friend in the world to whom he could appli
for advic or assist hi wretch father die some week befor
thi time in a fit of intox piedro walk up and down the
street scarc capabl of think much less of come to ani ration
resolut

the hour pass away the shadow of the hous lengthen under hi
footstep the even came on and when it grew dusk after hesit
in great agoni of mind for some time hi fear of the robber vengeanc
prevail over everi other feel and he went at the appoint hour to
the place of meet

the place of meet wa at the hous of that jew to whom he sever
month befor sold the diamond cross that cross which he thought
himself so lucki to have stolen and to have dispos of undetect wa
in fact the caus of hi be in hi present dread situat it
wa at the jew that he connect himself with thi gang of robber to
whom he wa now becom an absolut slave

oh that i dare to disobey! said he to himself with a deep sigh as
he knock softli at the back door of the jew hous the back door
open into a narrow unfrequ street and some small room at thi
side of the hous were set apart for the recept of guest who desir
to have their busi kept secret these room were separ by a dark
passag from the rest of the hous and number of peopl came to the
shop in the front of the hous which look into a credit street
without know anyth more from the ostens appear of the
shop than that it wa a kind of pawnbrok where old cloth old
iron and all sort of refus good might be dispos of conveni

at the moment piedro knock at the back door the front shop wa full of
customers; and the jew boy whose offic it wa to attend to these
signal let piedro in told him that none of hi comrad were yet come
and left him in a room by himself

he wa pale and trembl and felt a cold dew spread over him he had a
leaden imag of saint januariu tie round hi neck which in the midst
of hi wicked he superstiti preserv as a sort of charm and
on thi he kept hi eye stupidli fix as he sat alon in thi gloomi
place

he listen from time to time but he heard no nois at the side of the
hous where he wa hi accomplic did not arriv and in a sort of
impati terror the attend upon an evil conscienc he flung open
the door of hi cell and grope hi way through the passag which he
knew led to the public shop he long to hear some nois and to mix
with the live the jew when piedro enter the shop wa bargain
with a poor thin-look man about some gunpowd

i dont deni that it ha been wet said the man but sinc it wa in
the bucket of water it ha been care dri i tell you the simpl
truth that so soon after the grand erupt of mount vesuviu the
peopl of napl will not relish firework my poor littl rocket and
even my catherine-wheel will have no effect i am glad to part with
all i have in thi line of busi a few day ago i had fine thing in
readi for the countess de flora birthday which wa to have been
celebr at the count villa

whi do you fix your eye on me friend? what is your discours to me?
said piedro who imagin that the man fix hi eye upon him as he
mention the name of the count villa

i did not know that i fix my eye upon you; i wa think of my
firework said the poor man simpli but now that i do look at you
and hear your voic i recollect have had the pleasur of see you
befor

when? where? said piedro

a great while ago; no wonder you have forgotten me said the man; but
i can recal the night to your recollect you were in the street with
me the night i let off that unlucki rocket which frighten the hors
and wa the caus of overturn a ladi coach dont you rememb the
circumstance?

i have a confus recollect of some such thing said piedro in
great embarrassment; and he look suspici at thi man in doubt
whether he wa cun and want to sound him or whether he wa so
simpl as he appear

you did not perhap hear then continu the man that there wa a
great search made after the overturn for a fine diamond cross
belong to the ladi in the carriage? that ladi though i did not know
it till late wa the countess de flora

i know noth of the matter interrupt piedro in great agit
hi confus wa so mark that the firework-mak could not avoid
take notic of it; and a silenc of some moment ensu the jew more
practis in dissimul than piedro endeavour to turn the man
attent back to hi rocket and hi gunpowder--agre to take the
gunpowder--paid for it in hast and wa though appar unconcern
eager to get rid of him but thi wa not so easili done the man
curios wa excit and hi suspicion of piedro were increas everi
moment by all the dark chang of hi counten piedro overpow
with the sens of guilt surpris at the unexpect mention of the
diamond cross and of the count de flora villa stood like one
convict and seem fix to the spot without power of motion

i want to look at the old cambric that you said you had--that would do
for making--that you could let me have cheap for artifici flower
said the firework-mak to the jew; and as he spoke hi eye from time to
time look toward piedro

piedro felt for the leaden imag of the saint which he wore round hi
neck the string which held it crack and broke with the pull he gave
it thi slight circumst affect hi terrifi and superstiti
mind more than all the rest he imagin that at thi moment hi fate
wa decided; that saint januariu desert him and that he wa undon
he precipit follow the firework-man the instant he left the shop
and seiz hold of hi arm whisper i must speak to you

speak then said the man astonish

not here; thi way said he draw him toward the dark passage:
what i have to say must not be overheard you are go to the count de
flora are not you?

i am said the man he wa go there to speak to the countess about
some artifici flowers; but piedro thought he wa go to speak to her
about the diamond cross

you are go to give inform against me? nay hear me i confess
that i purloin that diamond cross; but i can do the count a great
servic upon condit that he pardon me hi villa is to be attack
thi night by four well arm men they will set out five hour henc
i am compel under the threat of assassin to accompani them; but
i shall do no more i throw myself upon the count merci hasten to
him--w have no time to lose

the poor man who heard thi confess escap from piedro the moment
he loos hi arm with all possibl expedit he ran to the count
palac in napl and relat to him all that had been said by piedro
some of the count servant on whom he could most depend were at a
distant part of the citi attend their mistress but the english
gentleman offer the servic of hi man arthur arthur no sooner heard
the busi and understood that francisco wa in danger than he arm
himself without say one word saddl hi english hors and wa readi

conjectur

but we are not to set out yet said the servant; it is but four mile
to torr del greco; the sbirri (offic of justice) are summoned--they
are to go with us--w must wait for them

they wait much against arthur inclin a consider time for
these sbirri at length they set out and just as they reach the
villa the flash of the pistol wa seen from one of the apart in the
hous the robber were there thi pistol wa snap by their captain
at poor francisco who had brave assert that he would as long as he

congratul him upon hi safeti and did not perceiv till he had
given him sever rough friendli shake that hi arm wa wound and
that he wa pale with the loss of blood

it is not much--onli a slight wound said francisco; one that i should
have escap if i had been upon my guard; but the sight of a face that i
littl expect to see in such compani took from me all presenc of mind;
and one of the ruffian stab me here in the arm whilst i stood in
stupid astonish

oh! take me to prison! take me to prison--i am weari of life--i am a
wretch not fit to live! cri piedro hold hi hand to be tie by

thomson

young hardi wa educ by mr freeman a veri excel master at one
of our rural sunday school he wa honest obedi activ and good-
natur henc he wa esteem by hi master; and be belov by all
hi companion who were good he did not desir to be love by the bad;
nor wa he at all vex or asham when idl mischiev or dishonest
boy attempt to plagu or ridicul him hi friend loveit on the
contrari wish to be univers like and hi highest ambit wa to
be thought the best natur boy in the school--and so he wa he usual
went by the name of poor loveit and everybodi piti him when he got
into disgrac which he frequent did for though he had a good
disposit he wa led to do thing which he knew to be wrong mere
becaus he could never have the courag to say no becaus he wa
afraid to offend the ill-natur and could not bear to be laugh at by
fool

one fine autumn even all the boy were permit to go out to play in
a pleasant green meadow near the school loveit and anoth boy call
tarlton began to play a game of battledor and shuttlecock and a larg
parti stood by to look on for they were the best player at battledor
and shuttlecock in the school and thi wa a trial of skill between
them when they had got it up to three hundr and twenti the game
becam veri interest the arm of the combat tire that they
could scarc wield the battledor the shuttlecock began to waver in
the air; now it almost touch the ground and now to the astonish
of the spectat mount again high over their heads: yet the stroke
becam feebler and feebler; and now loveit! now tarlton! resound
on all side for anoth minut the victori wa doubtful; but at length
the set sun shine full in loveit face so dazzl hi eye that
he could no longer see the shuttlecock and it fell at hi feet

after the first shout for tarlton triumph wa over everybodi
exclaim poor loveit! he the best natur fellow in the world! what
a piti that he did not stand with hi back to the sun!

now i dare you all to play anoth game with me cri tarlton
vauntingly; and as he spoke he toss the shuttlecock up with all hi
force--with so much forc that it went over the hedg and drop into a
lane which went close besid the field hey-day! said tarlton what
shall we do now?

the boy were strictli forbidden to go into the lane; and it wa upon
their promis not to break thi command that they were allow to play
in the adjoin field

no other shuttlecock wa to be had and their play wa stop they
stood on the top of the bank peep over the hedg i see it yonder
said tarlton; i wish somebodi would get it one could get over the gate
at the bottom of the field and be back again in half a minut ad
he look at loveit but you know we must not go into the lane said
loveit hesitatingli pugh! said tarlton whi now what harm could
it do?

i dont know said loveit drum upon hi battledore; but--

you dont know man! whi then what are you afraid of i ask you?
loveit colour went on drum and again in a lower voic said he
didnt know but upon tarlton repeat in a more insol tone i
ask you man what your afraid of? he suddenli left off drum and
look round said he wa not afraid of anyth that he knew of

ye but you are said hardi come forward

am i? said loveit; of what pray am i afraid?

of do wrong!

afraid of do wrong! repeat tarlton mimick him so that he made
everybodi laugh now hadnt you better say afraid of be flogged?

no said hardi coolli after the laugh had somewhat subsid i am as
littl afraid of be flog as you are tarlton; but i meant--

no matter what you meant; whi should you interfer with your wisdom and
your meanings; nobodi thought of ask you to stir a step for us; but we
ask loveit becaus he the best fellow in the world

and for that veri reason you should not ask him becaus you know he
cant refus you anyth

inde though cri loveit piqu there your mistaken for i
could refus if i chose it

hardi smiled; and loveit half afraid of hi contempt and half afraid of
tarlton ridicul stood doubt and again had recours to hi
battledor which he balanc most curious upon hi forefing look
at him!--now do look at him! cri tarlton; did you ever in your life
see anybodi look so silly?--hardi ha him quit under hi thumb; he so
mortal afraid of parson prig that he dare not for the soul of him
turn either of hi eye from the tip of hi nose; look how he squints!

i dont squint said loveit look up and nobodi ha me under hi
thumb! and what hardi said wa onli for fear i should get in disgrace;
he the best friend i have

loveit spoke thi with more than usual spirit for both hi heart and hi
pride were touch

come along then said hardi take him by the arm in an affection
manner; and he wa just go when tarlton call after him ay go
along with it best friend and take care it doe not get into a scrape;-
-good-by littl panado!

whom do they call littl panado? said loveit turn hi head hastili
back

never mind said hardi what doe it signify?

no said loveit to be sure it doe not signify; but one doe not like
to be call littl panado: besid ad he after go a few step
farther theyll all think it so ill-natur i had better go back and
just tell them that im veri sorri i cant get their shuttlecock; do come
back with me

no said hardi i cant go back; and youd better not

but i assur you i wont stay a minute; wait for me ad loveit;
and he slunk back again to prove that he wa not littl panado

onc return the rest follow of course; for to support hi charact
of good-natur he wa oblig to yield to the entreati of hi
companion and to show hi spirit leapt over the gate amidst the
acclam of the littl mob:--h wa quickli out of sight

here cri he return in about five minut quit out of breath
ive got the shuttlecock; and ill tell you what ive seen cri he
pant for breath

what? cri everybodi eagerli

whi just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane--p

well said tarlton impati do go on

let me just take breath first

pugh--nev mind your breath

well then just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane as i
wa look about for the shuttlecock i heard a great rustl somewher
near me and so i look where it could come from; and i saw in a nice
littl garden on the opposit side of the way a boy about as big as
tarlton sit in a great tree shake the branches: so i call to
the boy to beg one; but he said he could not give me one for that they
were hi grandfathers; and just at that minut from behind a gooseberri
bush up pop the uncle; the grandfath poke hi head out of the
window; so i ran off as fast as my leg would carri me though i heard him
bawl after me all the way

and let him bawl cri tarlton; he shant bawl for nothing; im
determin well have some of hi fine larg rosi appl befor i sleep
to-night

at thi speech a gener silenc ensued; everybodi kept their eye fix
upon tarlton except loveit who look down apprehens that he should
be drawn on much farther than he intend oh indeed! said he to
himself as hardi told me i had better not have come back!

regardless of thi confus tarlton continu but befor i say ani
more i hope we have no spi amongst us if there is ani one of you
afraid to be flog let him march off thi instant!

loveit colour bit hi lip wish to go but had not the courag to
move first he wait to see what everybodi els would do: nobodi
stirred; so loveit stood still

well then cri tarlton give hi hand to the boy next him then to
the next your word and honour that you wont betray me; but stand by
me and ill stand by you each boy gave hi hand and hi promise;
repeat stand by me and ill stand by you

loveit hung back till the last; and had almost twist off the button of
the boy coat who screen him when tarlton came up hold out hi
hand come loveit lad your in for it: stand by me and ill stand
by you

inde tarlton expostul he without look him in the face i
do wish youd give up thi scheme; i daresay all the appl are gone by
thi time; i wish you would do pray give up thi scheme

what scheme man? you havent heard it yet; you may as well know your
text befor you begin preach

the corner of loveit mouth could not refus to smile though in hi
heart he felt not the slightest inclin to laugh

whi i dont know you i declar i dont know you to-day said tarlton;
you use to be the best natur most agreeabl lad in the world and
would do anyth one ask you; but your quit alter of late as we
were say just now when you skulk away with hardy: come--do man
pluck up a littl spirit and be one of us or youll make us all hate
you

hate me! repeat loveit with terror; no sure you wont all hate
me! and he mechan stretch out hi hand which tarlton shook
violent say ay now that right

ay now that wrong! whisper loveit conscience; but hi
conscienc wa of no use to him for it wa alway overpow by the
voic of numbers; and though he had the wish he never had the power to
do right poor loveit! i knew he would not refus us cri hi
companions; and even tarlton the moment he shook hand with him
despis him it is certain that weak of mind is despis both by
the good and the bad

the leagu be thu form tarlton assum all the air of command
explain hi scheme and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old
man apple-tre it wa the onli one he had the world we shall not
dwell upon their consultation; for the amus of contriv such
expedit is often the chief thing which induc idl boy to engag in
them

there wa a small window at the end of the back staircas through which
between nine and ten oclock at night tarlton accompani by loveit and
anoth boy crept out it wa a moonlight night and after cross the
field and climb the gate direct by loveit who now resolv to go
through the affair with spirit they proceed down the lane with rash
yet fear step

at a distanc loveit saw the white wash cottag and the apple-tre
besid it they quicken their pace and with some difficulti scrambl
through the hedg which fenc the garden though not without be
scratch and torn by the brier everyth wa silent yet now and
then at everi rustl of the leav they start and their heart
beat violent onc as loveit wa climb the apple-tre he thought
he heard a door in the cottag open and earnestli beg hi companion
to desist and return home thi howev he could by no mean persuad
them to do until they had fill their pocket with apples; then to hi
great joy they return crept in at the window and each retir as
softli as possibl to hi own apart

loveit slept in the room with hardi whom he had left fast asleep and
whom he now wa extrem afraid of awaken all the appl were
empti out of loveit pocket and lodg with tarlton till the
morn for fear the smell should betray the secret to hardi the room
door wa apt to creak but it wa open with such precaut that no
nois could be heard and loveit found hi friend as fast asleep as when
he left him

ah said he to himself how quietli he sleeps! i wish i had been
sleep too the reproach of loveit conscienc howev serv no
other purpos but to torment him; he had not suffici strength of mind
to be good the veri next night in spite of all hi fear and all hi
penit and all hi resolut by a littl fresh ridicul and
persuas he wa induc to accompani the same parti on a similar
expedit we must observ that the necess for continu their
depred becam stronger the third day; for though at first onli a
small parti had been in the secret by degre it wa divulg to the
whole school; and it wa necessari to secur secreci by share the
booti

everyon wa astonish that hardi with all hi quick and
penetr had not yet discov their proceedings; but loveit could
not help suspect that he wa not quit so ignor as he appear to
be loveit had strictli kept hi promis of secrecy; but he wa by no
mean an art boy; and in talk to hi friend consciou that he had
someth to conceal he wa perpetu on the point of betray
himself; then recollect hi engag he blush stammer
bungled; and upon hardi ask what he meant would answer with a
silli guilti counten that he did not know; or abruptli break off
say oh nothing! noth at all!

it wa in vain that he urg tarlton to permit him to consult hi friend
a gloom overspread tarlton brow when he began to speak on the subject
and he alway return a peremptori refus accompani with some such
taunt express as this--i wish we had noth to do with such a
sneak fellow; hell betray us all i see befor we have done with
him

well said loveit to himself so i am abus after all and call a
sneak fellow for my pains; that rather hard to be sure when ive
got so littl by the job

in truth he had not got much; for in the divis of the booti onli one
appl and half of anoth which wa onli half ripe happen to fall to
hi share; though to be sure when they had all eaten their appl he
had the satisfact to hear everybodi declar they were veri sorri they
had forgotten to offer some of their to poor loveit

in the meantim the visit to the apple-tre had been now too frequent
repeat to remain conceal from the old man who live in the cottag
he use to examin hi onli tree veri frequent and miss number of
rosi appl which he had watch ripen he though not prone to
suspicion began to think that there wa someth go wrong;
especi as a gap wa made in hi hedg and there were sever small
footstep in hi flower bed

the good old man wa not at all inclin to give pain to ani live
creatur much less to children of whom he wa particularli fond nor
wa he in the least avarici for though he wa not rich he had enough
to live upon becaus he had been veri industri in hi youth; and he
wa alway veri readi to part with the littl he had nor wa he a cross
old man if anyth would have made him angri it would have been the
see hi favourit tree rob as he had promis himself the pleasur
of give hi red appl to hi grandchildren on hi birthday howev
he look up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger and lean upon
hi staff he began to consid what he had best do

if i complain to their master said he to himself they will certainli
be flog and that i should be sorri for: yet they must not be let to
go on stealing; that would be wors still for it would sure bring them
to the gallow in the end let me see--oh ay that will do; i will
borrow farmer kent dog barker hell keep them off ill answer for
it

farmer kent lent hi dog barker caution hi neighbour at the same
time to be sure to chain him well for he wa the fiercest mastiff in
england the old man with farmer kent assist chain him fast to
the trunk of the apple-tre

night came; and tarlton loveit and hi companion return at the usual
hour grown bolder now by frequent success they came on talk and
laugh but the moment they had set their foot in the garden the dog
start up; and shake the chain as he sprang forward bark with
unremit furi they stood still as if fix to the spot there wa
just moonlight enough to see the dog let us tri the other side of the
tree said tarlton but to whichev side they turn the dog flew
round in an instant bark with increas furi

hell break hi chain and tear us to piec cri tarlton; and struck
with terror he immedi threw down the basket he had brought with
him and betook himself to flight with the greatest precipit
help me! oh pray help me! i cant get through the hedg cri
loveit in a lament tone whilst the dog growl hideous and
sprang forward to the extrem of hi chain i cant get out! oh for
god sake stay for me one minut dear tarlton! he call in vain; he
wa left to struggl through hi difficulti by himself; and of all hi
dear friend not one turn back to help him at last torn and
terrifi he got through the hedg and ran home despis hi
companion for their selfish nor could he help observ that
tarlton with all hi vaunt prowess wa the first to run away from the
appear of danger

the next morn loveit could not help reproach the parti with their
conduct whi could not you ani of you stay one minut to help me?
said he

we did not hear you call answer one

i wa so frighten said anoth i would not have turn back for
the whole world

and you tarlton?

i said tarlton; had not i enough to do to take care of myself you
blockhead? everyon for himself in thi world!

so i see said loveit grave

well man! is there anyth strang in that?

strange! whi yes; i thought you all love me!

lord love you lad! so we do; but we love ourselv better

hardi would not have serv me so howev said loveit turn away
in disgust tarlton wa alarm pugh! said he; what nonsens have
you taken into your brain! think no more about it we are all veri
sorri and beg your pardon; come shake hand forgiv and forget

loveit gave hi hand but gave it rather coldli i forgiv it with all
my heart said he; but i cannot forget it so soon!

whi then you are not such a good humour fellow as we thought you
were sure you cannot bear malic loveit loveit smile and
allow that he certainli could not bear malic well then come; you
know at the bottom we all love you and would do anyth in the world
for you poor loveit flatter in hi foibl began to believ that
they did love him at the bottom as they said and even with hi eye
open consent again to be dupe

how strang it is thought he that i should set such valu upon the
love of those i despise! when im onc out of thi scrape ill have no
more to do with them im determin

compar with hi friend hardi hi new associ did inde appear
contemptible; for all thi time hardi had treat him with uniform
kind avoid to pri into hi secret yet seem readi to receiv
hi confid if it had been offer

after school in the even as he wa stand silent besid hardi
who wa rule a sheet of paper for him tarlton in hi brutal manner
came up and seiz him by the arm cri come along with me loveit
ive someth to say to you

i cant come now said loveit draw away hi arm

ah do come now said tarlton in a voic of persuas

well ill come present

nay but do pray; there a good fellow come now becaus i have
someth to say to you

what is it youv got to say to me? i wish youd let me alon said
loveit; yet at the same time he suffer himself to he led away

tarlton took particular pain to humour him and bring him into temper
again; and even though he wa not veri apt to part with hi playth
went so far as to say loveit the other day you want a top; ill give
you mine if you desir it

loveit thank him and wa overjoy at the thought of possess thi
top but what did you want to say to me just now?

ay well talk of that presently; not yet--when we get out of hear

nobodi is near us said loveit

come a littl farther howev said tarlton look round
suspici

blue handkerchief

and is it for the dog?

yes; i vow id be reveng on him and after thi hell never bark

start back with horror

onli poison for a dog said tarlton confused; you could not look more

loveit stood for nearli a minut in profound silenc tarlton said he
at last in a chang tone and alter manner i did not know you; i
will have no more to do with you

nay but stay said tarlton catch hold of hi arm stay; i wa
onli joke

let go my arm--you were in earnest

but then that wa befor i knew there wa ani harm if you think

whi you know i might not know; for tom told me it a thing that
often done ask tom

ill ask nobody! sure we know better what right and wrong than tom
doe

but onli just ask him to hear what hell say

i dont want to hear what hell say cri loveit vehemently: the
dog will die in agonies--in agonies! there wa a dog poison at my
fathers--i saw him in the yard poor creature! he lay and howl and
writh himself!

poor creature! well there no harm done now cri tarlton in a
hypocrit tone but though he thought fit to dissembl with loveit
he wa thoroughli determin in hi purpos

poor loveit in hast to get away return to hi friend hardy; but hi
mind wa in such agit that he neither talk nor move like
himself; and two or three time hi heart wa so full that he wa readi
to burst into tear

how good-natur you are to me said he to hardi as he wa tri
vainli to entertain him; but if you knew-- here he stop short for
the bell for even prayer rang and they all took their place and
knelt down after prayer as they were go to bed loveit stop
tarlton--well! ask he in an inquir manner fix hi eye upon

about ten minut after thi as he and hardi were undress hardi
suddenli recollect that he had left hi new kite out upon the grass

they both went to the top of the stair to call tom; no one answer
they call again louder is tom below?

im here answer he at last come out of tarlton room with a look
of mix embarrass and effronteri and as he wa receiv hardi
commiss loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hang out of
hi pocket thi excit fresh suspicion in loveit mind; but without
say one word he immedi station himself at the window in hi
room which look out toward the lane; and as the moon wa risen he
could see if anyon pass that way

what are you do there? said hardi after he had been watch some
time; whi dont you come to bed? loveit return no answer but
continu stand at the window nor did he watch long in vain
present he saw tom glide slowli along a by-path and get over the
gate into the lane

could not command

who gone? to do what? cri hardi start up

how cruel! how wicked! continu loveit

what cruel--what wicked? speak out at once! return hardi in that
command tone which in moment of danger strong mind feel themselv
entitl to assum toward weak one loveit instantli though in an
incoher manner explain the affair to him scarc had the word
pass hi lip when hardi sprang up and began dress himself without
say one syllabl

anxieti theyll never forgiv me! dont betray me! theyll never
forgive! pray speak to me! onli say you wont betray us

i will not betray you trust to me said hardy: and he left the room
and loveit stood in amazement; while in the meantim hardi in hope of
overtak tom befor the fate of the poor dog wa decid ran with all
possibl speed across the meadow then down the lane he came up with
tom just as he wa climb the bank into the old man garden hardi
too much out of breath to speak seiz hold of him drag him down

said mr william power to himself stalk off with step which made the
whole galleri resound and which made mani a guilti heart trembl

the convers which had pass between hardi and mr power at the head
of the stair had been anxious listen to; but onli a word or two here
and there had been distinctli overheard

the lock of the black hole door wa a terribl sound--som knew not
what it portend and other knew too well all assembl in the
morn with face of anxieti tarlton and loveit were the most
agitated: tarlton for himself loveit for hi friend for himself for
everybodi everi one of the parti and tarlton at their head surround
him with reproaches; and consid him as the author of the evil which
hung over them how could you do so? and whi did you say anyth to
hardi about it? when you had promis too! oh! what shall we all do?
what a scrape you have brought us into loveit it all your fault!

tarlton

at thi instant the prison wa led in and as he pass through the
circl everi eye wa fix upon him hi eye fell upon no one not even
upon loveit who pull him by the coat as he passed--everyon felt
almost afraid to breath

the basket-woman

tout leur etud etait de se complair et de sentraid *
paul et virgini

at the foot of a steep slipperi white hill near dunstabl in
bedfordshir call chalk hill there is a hut or rather a hovel which
travel could scarc suppos could be inhabit if they did not see
the smoke rise from it peak roof an old woman live in thi hovel
** and with her a littl boy and girl the children of a beggar who die
and left these orphan perish with hunger they thought themselv
veri happi when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid
them warm themselv at her small fire and gave them a crust of mouldi
bread to eat she had not much to give but what she had she gave with
good-wil she wa veri kind to these poor children and work hard at
her spinning-wheel and at her knit to support herself and them she
earn money also in anoth way she use to follow all the carriag
as they went up chalk hill and when the hors stop to take breath or
to rest themselv she put stone behind the carriag wheel to prevent
them from roll backward down the steep slipperi hill

* their whole studi wa how to pleas and to help one anoth
** thi wa about the close of the 18th centuri

the littl boy and girl love to stand besid the good natur old
woman spinning-wheel when she wa spin and to talk to her at
these time she taught them someth which she said she hope they
would rememb all their live she explain to them what is meant by
tell the truth and what it is to be honest she taught them to
dislik idl and to wish that they could be use

one even as they were stand besid her the littl boy said to
her grandmoth for that wa the name by which she like that these
children should call her--grandmoth how often you are forc to get
up from your spinning-wheel and to follow the chais and coach up
that steep hill to put stone underneath the wheel to hinder them from
roll back! the peopl who are in the carriag give you a halfpenni
or a penni for do thi dont they?

ye child

but it is veri hard work for you to go up and down that hill you often
say that you are tire and then you know that you cannot spin all that
time now if we might go up the hill and put the stone behind the
wheel you could sit still at your work and would not the peopl give
us the halfpence? and could not we bring them all to you? do pray dear
grandmoth tri us for one day--to-morrow will you?

ye said the old woman; i will tri what you can do; but i must go up
the hill along with you for the first two or three time for fear you
should get yourselv hurt

so the next day the littl boy and girl went with their grandmoth as
they use to call her up the steep hill; and she show the boy how to
prevent the wheel from roll back by put stone behind them; and
she said thi is call scotch the wheels; and she took off the
boy hat and gave it to the littl girl to hold up to the carriage-
window readi for the halfpenc

when she thought that the children knew how to manag by themselv she
left them and return to her spinning-wheel a great mani carriag
happen to go by thi day and the littl girl receiv a great mani
halfpenc she carri them all in her brother hat to her grandmoth
in the evening; and the old woman smile and thank the children she
said that they had been use to her and that her spin had gone on
fine becaus she had been abl to sit still at her wheel all day
but paul my boy said she what is the matter with your hand?

onli a pinch--onli one pinch that i got as i wa put a stone behind
a wheel of a chais it doe not hurt me much grandmother; and ive
thought of a good thing for to-morrow i shall never be hurt again if
you will onli be so good as to give me the old handl of the broken
crutch grandmoth and the block of wood that lie in the chimney-
corner and that is of no use ill make it of some use if i may have
it

take it then dear said the old woman; and youll find the handl of
the broken crutch under my bed

paul went to work immedi and fasten one end of the pole into the
block of wood so as to make someth like a dry-rub brush look
grandmamma look at my scotcher i call thi thing my scotcher said
paul becaus i shall alway scotch the wheel with it i shall never
pinch my finger again; my hand you see will be safe at the end of
thi long stick; and sister ann you need not be at the troubl of
carri ani more stone after me up the hill; we shall never want stone
ani more my scotcher will do without anyth els i hope i wish it
wa morn and that a carriag would come that i might run up the
hill and tri my scotcher

and i wish that as mani chais may go by to-morrow as there did to-day
and that we may bring you as mani halfpenc grandmoth said the
littl girl

so do i my dear ann said the old woman; for i mean that you and
your brother shall have all the money that you get to-morrow you may
buy some gingerbread for yourselv or some of those ripe plum that you
saw at the fruit-stal the other day which is just go into dunstabl
i told you then that i could not afford to buy such thing for you; but
now that you can earn halfpenc for yourselv children it is fair
should tast a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for onc and a way in
your live

well bring some of the gingerbread home to her shant we brother?
whisper littl ann the morn came; but no carriag were heard
though paul and hi sister had risen at five oclock that they might be
sure to be readi for earli travel paul kept hi scotcher pois
upon hi shoulder and watch eagerli at hi station at the bottom of
the hill he did not wait long befor a carriag came he follow it
up the hill; and the instant the postillion call to him and bid him
stop the wheel he put hi scotcher behind them and found that it
answer the purpos perfectli well

mani carriag went by thi day and paul and ann receiv a great mani
halfpenc from the travel

when it grew dusk in the even ann said to her brother--i dont
think ani more carriag will come by to-day let us count the
halfpenc and carri them home now to grandmoth

no not yet answer paul let them alone--let them lie still in the
hole where i have put them i daresay more carriag will come by befor
it is quit dark and then we shall have more halfpenc

paul had taken the halfpenc out of hi hat and he had put them into a
hole in the high bank by the roadside; and ann said she would not meddl
with them and that she would wait till her brother like to count them;
and paul said--if you will stay and watch here i will go and gather
some blackberri for you in the hedg in yonder field stand you
hereabout half-way up the hill and the moment you see ani carriag
come along the road run as fast as you can and call me

ann wait a long time or what she thought a long time; and she saw no
carriag and she trail her brother scotcher up and down till she wa
tire then she stood still and look again and she saw no carriage;
so she went sorrow into the field and to the hedg where her
brother wa gather blackberri and she said paul im sadli tire
sadli tired! said she and my eye are quit strain with look for
chaises; no more chais will come to-night; and your scotcher is lie
there of no use upon the ground have not i wait long enough for to-
day paul?

oh no said paul; here are some blackberri for you; you had better
wait a littl bit longer perhap a carriag might go by whilst you are
stand here talk to me

ann who wa of a veri oblig temper and who like to do what she wa
ask to do went back to the place where the scotcher lay; and scarc
had she reach the spot when she heard the nois of a carriag she
ran to call her brother and to their great joy they now saw four
chais come toward them paul as soon as they went up the hill
follow with hi scotcher; first he scotch the wheel of one carriag
then of another; and ann wa so much delight with observ how well
the scotcher stop the wheel and how much better it wa than stone
that she forgot to go and hold her brother hat to the travel for
halfpenc till she wa rous by the voic of a littl rosi girl who
wa look out of the window of one of the chais come close to the
chaise-door said the littl girl; here are some halfpenc for you

ann held the hat; and she afterward went on to the other carriag
money wa thrown to her from each of them; and when they had all gotten
safe to the top of the hill she and her brother sat down upon a larg
stone by the roadsid to count their treasur first they began by
count what wa in the hat--on two three four halfpenc

but oh brother look at this! exclaim anne; thi is not the same
as the other halfpenc

no inde it is not cri paul it is no halfpenny; it is a guinea
a bright golden guinea!

is it? said ann who had never seen a guinea in her life befor and
who did not know it value; and will it do as well as a halfpenni to buy
gingerbread? ill run to the fruit-stal and ask the woman; shall i?

no no said paul you need not ask ani woman or anybodi but me; i
can tell you all about it as well as anybodi in the whole world

the whole world! oh paul you forgot not so well as my grandmoth

whi not so well as my grandmoth perhap but ann i can tell you
that you must not talk yourself ann but you must listen to me quietli
or els you wont understand what i am go to tell you for i can
assur you that i dont think i quit understood it myself ann the
first time my grandmoth told it to me though i stood stock still
listen my best

prepar by thi speech to hear someth veri difficult to be
understood ann look veri grave and her brother explain to her
that with a guinea she might buy two hundr and fifty-two time as
mani plum as she could get for a penni

whi paul you know the fruit-woman said she would give us a dozen plum
for a penni now for thi littl guinea would she give us two hundr
and fifty-two dozen?

if she ha so mani and if we like to have so mani to be sure she
will said paul but i think we should not like to have two hundr and
fifty-two dozen of plums; we could not eat such a number

but we could give some of them to my grandmoth said ann

but still there would be too mani for her and for us too said paul
and when we had eaten the plum there would be an end to all the
pleasur but now ill tell you what i am think of ann that we
might buy someth for my grandmoth that would be veri use to her
inde with the guinea--someth that would last a great while

what brother? what sort of thing?

someth that she said she want veri much last winter when she wa
so ill with the rheumatism--someth that she said yesterday when you
were make her bed she wish she might be abl to buy befor next
winter

i know i know what you mean! said anne--a blanket oh ye paul
that will be much better than plums; do let us buy a blanket for her; how
glad she will be to see it! i will make her bed with the new blanket
and then bring her to see it but paul how shall we buy a blanket?
where are blanket to be got?

leav that to me ill manag that i know where blanket can be got
i saw one hang out of a shop the day i went last to dunstabl

you have seen a great mani thing at dunstabl brother

ye a great many; but i never saw anyth there or anywher els that
i wish for half so much as i did for the blanket for my grandmoth
do you rememb how she use to shiver with the cold last winter? ill
buy the blanket to-morrow im go to dunstabl with her spin

and youll bring the blanket to me and i shall make the bed veri
neatli that will be all right--al happy! said ann clap her
hand

but stay! hush! dont clap your hand so anne; it will not be all
happi im afraid said paul and hi counten chang and he look
veri grave it will not be all right im afraid for there is one
thing we have neither of us thought of but that we ought to think about
we cannot buy the blanket im afraid

whi paul why?

becaus i dont think thi guinea is honestli our

nay brother but im sure it is honestli our it wa given to us and
grandmoth said all that wa given to us to-day wa to be our own

but who gave it to you anne?

some of the peopl in those chais paul i dont know which of them
but i daresay it wa the littl rosi girl

no said paul for when she call you to the chais door she said
here some halfpenc for you now if she gave you the guinea she
must have given it to you by mistak

well but perhap some of the peopl in the other chais gave it to me
and did not give it to me by mistak paul there wa a gentleman
read in one of the chais and a ladi who look veri good-naturedli
at me and then the gentleman put down hi book and put hi head out of
the window and look at your scotcher brother and he ask me if that
wa your own making; and when i said ye and that i wa your sister he
smile at me and put hi hand into hi waistcoat pocket and threw a
hand of halfpenc into the hat and i daresay he gave us the guinea
along with them becaus he like your scotcher so much

whi said paul that might be to be sure but i wish i wa quit
certain of it

then as we are not quit certain had not we best go and ask my
grandmoth what she think about it?

paul thought thi wa excel advice; and he wa not a silli boy who
did not like to follow good advic he went with hi sister directli to
hi grandmoth show her the guinea and told her how they came by it

my dear honest children said she i am veri glad you told me all
thi i am veri glad that you did not buy either the plum or the
blanket with thi guinea im sure it is not honestli our those who
threw it you gave it you by mistak i warrant; and what i would have you
do is to go to dunstabl and tri if you can at either of the inn find
out the person who gave it to you it is now so late in the even that
perhap the travel will sleep at dunstabl instead of go on the
next stage; and it is like that whosoev gave you a guinea instead of
a halfpenni ha found out their mistak by thi time all you can do is
to go and inquir for the gentleman who wa read in the chais

oh! interrupt paul i know a good way of find him out i
rememb it wa a dark green chais with red wheels: and i rememb i
read the innkeep name upon the chais john nelson (i am much
oblig to you for teach me to read grandmother) you told me
yesterday grandmoth that the name written upon chais are the
innkeep to whom they belong i read the name of the innkeep upon
that chais it wa john nelson so ann and i will go to both the inn
in dunstabl and tri to find out thi chaise--john nelson come
anne; let us set out befor it get quit dark

ann and her brother pass with great courag the tempt stall that
wa cover with gingerbread and ripe plum and pursu their way
steadili through the street of dunstable; but paul when he came to the
shop where he had seen the blanket stop for a moment and said it
is a great piti ann that the guinea is not our howev we are
do what is honest and that is a comfort here we must go through
thi gateway into the inn-yard; we are come to the dun cow

cow! said ann i see no cow

look up and youll see the cow over your head said paul--th sign--
the pictur come never mind look at it now; i want to find out the
green chais that ha john nelson name upon it

paul push forward through a crowd passag till he got into the inn-
yard there wa a great nois and bustl the hostler were carri in
luggag the postillion were rub down the hors or roll the
chais into the coach-hous

what now! what busi have you here pray? said a waiter who almost
ran over paul as he wa cross the yard in a great hurri to get some
empti bottl from the bottle-rack youv no busi here crowd
up the yard walk off young gentleman if you pleas

pray give me leav sir said paul to stay a few minut to look
amongst these chais for one dark green chais with red wheel that ha
mr john nelson name written upon it

what that he say about a dark green chaise? said one of the
postillion

what should such a one as he is know about chaises? interrupt the
hasti waiter and he va go to turn paul out of the yard; but the
hostler caught hold of hi arm and said mayb the child ha some
busi here; let know what he ha to say for himself

the waiter wa at thi instant luckili oblig to leav them to attend
the bell; and paul told hi busi to the hostler who as soon as he
saw the guinea and heard the stori shook paul by the hand and said
stand steadi my honest lad; ill find the chais for you if it is to
be found here; but john nelson chais almost alway drive to the
black bull

after some difficulti the green chais with john nelson name upon it
and the postillion who drove that chais were found; and the postillion
told paul that he wa just go into the parlour to the gentleman he had
driven to be paid and that he would carri the guinea with him

no said paul we should like to give it back ourselv

ye said the hostler; that they have a right to do

the postillion made no repli but look vex and went toward the
hous desir the children would wait in the passag till hi return
in the passag there wa stand a decent clean good natur look
woman with two huge straw basket on each side of her one of the
basket stood a littl in the way of the entranc a man who wa push
hi way in and carri in hi hand a string of dead lark hung to a
pole impati at be stop kick down the straw basket and all
it content were thrown out bright straw hat and box and
slipper were all thrown in disord upon the dirti ground

oh they will be trampl upon! they will be all spoiled! exclaim
the woman to whom they belong

well help you to pick them up if you will let us cri paul and anne;
and they immedi ran to her assist

when the thing were all safe in the basket again the children express
a desir to know how such beauti thing could be made of straw; but
the woman had not time to answer befor the postillion came out of the
parlour and with him a gentleman servant who came to paul and
clap him upon the back said so my littl chap i gave you a
guinea for a halfpenni i hear; and i understand youv brought it back
again; that right give me hold of it

no brother said ann thi is not the gentleman that wa read

pooh child i came in mr nelson green chais here the postillion
can tell you so i and my master came in that chais i and my master
that wa read as you say and it wa he that threw the money out to
you he is go to bed; he is tire and cant see you himself he
desir that youll give me the guinea

he push them toward the door; but the basket-woman whisper to them
as they went out wait in the street till i come to you

pray mr landladi cri thi gentleman servant address himself
to the landladi who just then came out of a room where some compani were
at supper pray mr landladi pleas to let me have roast lark for
my supper you are famou for lark at dunstable; and i make it a rule
to tast the best of everyth wherev i go; and waiter let me have a
bottl of claret do you hear?

lark and claret for hi supper said the basket-woman to herself as
she look at him from head to foot the postillion wa still wait
as if to speak to him; and she observ them afterward whisper and
laugh togeth no bad hit wa a sentenc which the servant
pronounc sever time

now it occur to the basket-woman that thi man had cheat the
children out of the guinea to pay for the lark and claret; and she
thought that perhap she could discov the truth she wait quietli in
the passag

waiter! joe! joe! cri the landladi whi dont you carri in the
sweetmeat-puff and the tart here to the compani in the best parlour?

come maam answer the waiter; and with a larg dish of tart and
puff the waiter came from the bar; the landladi threw open the door of
the best parlour to let him in; and the basket-woman had now a full view
of a larg cheer compani and amongst them sever children sit
round a supper-t

ay whisper the landladi as the door close after the waiter and the
tart there are custom enough i warrant for you in that room if
you had but the luck to be call in pray what would you have the
conscienc i wonder now to charg me for these here half-dozen littl
mat to put under my dishes?

a trifl maam said the basket-woman she let the landladi have the
mat cheap and the landladi then declar she would step in and see if
the compani in the best parlour had done supper when they come to
their wine ad she ill speak a good word for you and get you
call in afor the children are sent to bed

the landladi after the usual speech of i hope the supper and
everyth is to your like ladi and gentlemen began with if ani
of the young gentlemen or ladi would have a curos to see ani of our
famou dunstabl straw-work there a decent bodi without would i
daresay be proud to show them her pincushion-box and her basket and
slipper and her other curos

the eye of the children all turn toward their mother; their mother
smile and immedi their father call in the basket-woman and
desir her to produc her curios the children gather round her
larg pannier as it open but they did not touch ani of her thing

ah papa! cri a littl rosi girl here are a pair of straw slipper
that would just fit you i think; but would not straw shoe wear out veri
soon? and would not they let in the wet?

ye my dear said her father but these slipper are meant--

for powdering-slipp miss interrupt the basket-woman

to wear when peopl are powder their hair continu the gentleman
that they may not spoil their other shoe

and will you buy them papa?

no i cannot indulg myself said her father in buy them now i
must make amend said he laugh for my carelessness; and as i
threw away a guinea to-day i must endeavour to save sixpenc at least?

ah the guinea that you threw by mistak into the littl girl hat as
we were come up chalk hill mamma i wonder that the littl girl did
not take notic of it be a guinea and that she did not run after the
chais to give it back again i should think if she had been an honest
girl she would have return it

miss!--maam!--sir! said the basket-woman if it would not be
impertin may i speak a word? a littl boy and girl have just been
here inquir for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a
halfpenni by mistake; and not five minut ago i saw the boy give the
guinea to a gentleman servant who is there without and who said hi
master desir it should be return to him

there must be some mistak or some trick in thi said the gentleman
are the children gone? i must see them--send after them

ill go for them myself said the good natur basket-woman; i bid
them wait in the street yonder for my mind misgav me that the man who
spoke so short to them wa a cheat with hi lark and hi claret

paul and ann were speedili summon and brought back by their friend
the basket-woman; and ann the moment she saw the gentleman knew that
he wa the veri person who smile upon her who admir her brother
scotcher and who threw a hand of halfpenc into the hat; but she
could not be certain she said that she receiv the guinea from him;
she onli thought it most like that she did

but i can be certain whether the guinea you return be mine or no
said the gentleman i mark the guinea; it wa a light one; the onli
guinea i had which i put into my waistcoat pocket thi morn he
rang the bell and desir the waiter to let the gentleman who wa in the
room opposit to him know that he wish to see him

the gentleman in the white parlour sir do you mean?

i mean the master of the servant who receiv a guinea from thi child

he is a mr pembrok sir said the waiter

mr pembrok came; and as soon as he heard what had happen he desir
the waiter to show him to the room where hi servant wa at supper the
dishonest servant who wa sup upon lark and claret knew noth of
what wa go on; but hi knife and fork drop from hi hand and he
overturn a bumper of claret as he start up from the tabl in great
surpris and terror when hi master came in with a face of indign
and demand the guinea--th guinea sir! that you got from thi child;
that guinea which you said i order you to ask for from thi child

the servant confound and half intox could onli stammer out that
he had more guinea than one about him and that he realli did not know
which it wa he pull hi money out and spread it upon the tabl with
trembl hand the mark guinea appear hi master instantli
turn him out of hi servic with strong express of contempt

and now my littl honest girl said the gentleman who had admir her
brother scotcher turn to ann and now tell me who you are and
what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world

in the same moment ann and paul exclaim the thing we wish for the
most in the world is a blanket for our grandmoth

she is not our grandmoth in realiti i believ sir said paul; but
she is just as good to us and taught me to read and taught ann to
knit and taught us both that we should be honest--so she has; and i wish
she had a new blanket befor next winter to keep her from the cold and
the rheumat she had the rheumat sadli last winter sir; and there
is a blanket in thi street that would be just the thing for her

she shall have it then; and continu the gentleman i will do
someth more for you do you like to be employ or to be idl best?
